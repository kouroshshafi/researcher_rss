# Alternative to Researcher: A Personal RSS Feed of Academic Abstracts
With the discontinuation of [Researcher App](https://www.researcher-app.com), I'm sharing my personal reading RSS feed of academic abstracts. This feed is updated daily and can be imported into any RSS reader.

# Accessing the RSS Feed
To access the feed, visit the following URL: [RSS Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kouroshshafi/researcher_rss/refs/heads/main/feed_content). Note that the "raw" in the URL address is necessary for the feed to load correctly in any rss reader app.

# Customizing the Feed
If you'd like to customize and run the Python file on your computer, feel free to send me a message, and I'll share the underlying code with you.
