# researcher_rss
business, econ, accounting and finance rss from top journals


Now that [researcher](https://www.researcher-app.com) is out of business, I am sharing how I create a feed for my own reading abstracts. 

I update the file feed_content everyday as well with a feed of abstracts from top academic journals in management, accounting, finance and economics; importing the raw file located at [feed content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kouroshshafi/researcher_rss/refs/heads/main/feed_content) into any RSS reader.

If you want to customize and run the python file on your computer, just send me a messange and I share the python file.
