    <title>Sorting to Expensive Cities</title>
    <updated>2025-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a spatial equilibrium model with heterogeneous households holding general non-homothetic preferences over tradable goods and housing. In equilibrium, desirable and productive locations command high housing prices. So long as housing is a necessity, these locations are disproportionately inhabited by high-income earners who are relatively less affected by high housing prices. We clarify how this source of sorting complements other potential sorting forces in spatial equilibrium models, namely, comparative advantage in production and heterogeneous preferences for locations. We show how to measure changes in welfare inequality across income groups in a theoretically-consistent way when housing is a necessity, extending the approach popular in models with homothetic preferences. We use our framework to track the evolution of welfare inequality between college and non-college graduates in the United States between 1980 and 2020. We find that, accounting for change in prices, it has risen by more than nominal wage inequality, even as college graduates increasingly sort into cities with expensive housing over this time period.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Geoeconomics is the use of a country’s economic strength to exert influence on foreign entities to achieve geopolitical or economic goals. We discuss how concepts of power in the political science and economics literature can be used to guide research on geoeconomics. Economic threats as a form of coercion have seen a recent resurgence. We show how different types of threats can be modeled using simple tools and discuss what channels their potential effectiveness is based on. We discuss important open questions for the future literature to pursue.</content>

    <title>If You Had One Shot: Scale and Herding in Innovation Experiments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Solving complex problems- in medicine, engineering, and other technological domains- often requires exploring multiple approaches, particularly when significant uncertainty exists about which one will lead to success. Conventional wisdom assumes that having many experimenters independently decide which approaches to pursue increases diversity and, thus, also the chances of finding a solution. However, if experimenters herd toward the most promising approach, this convergence may reduce diversity and thus the likelihood of solving the problem. In this paper, we develop a simple model to show that, holding the total number of experiments constant, markets dominated by a few large-scale experimenters- firms conducting multiple experiments- explore more diverse approaches than markets with many single-shot experimenters. Single-shot experimenters tend to converge on the most promising approach, while multi-experimenters are more likely to diversify to avoid the correlation inherent in pursuing multiple experiments within the same approach. We test our model's predictions using data from pharmaceutical R&amp;D. Our analysis shows that increasing the average number of experiments per firm by one unit raises target diversity by over three standard deviations. In turn, a one-standard deviation increase from the mean in target diversity boosts the likelihood of at least one experiment reaching Phase 1 clinical trials by 25.9 percentage points. Our findings inform policies for the optimal allocation of experiments across firms to maximize approach diversity and market-level success.</content>

    <title>The Effects of Eviction on Children</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Eviction may be an important channel for the intergenerational transmission of poverty, and concerns about its effects on children are often raised as a rationale for tenant protection policies. We study how eviction impacts children's home environment, school engagement, educational achievement, and high school completion by assembling new data sets linking eviction court records in Chicago and New York to administrative public school records and restricted Census records. To disentangle the consequences of eviction from the effects of correlated sources of economic distress, we use a research design based on the random assignment of court cases to judges who vary in their leniency. We find that eviction increases children's residential mobility, homelessness, and likelihood of doubling up with grandparents or other adults. Eviction also disrupts school engagement, causing increased absences and school changes. While we find little impact on elementary and middle school test scores, eviction substantially reduces high school course credits. Lastly, we find that eviction reduces high school graduation and use a novel bounding method to show that this finding is not driven by differential attrition. The disruptive effects of eviction appear worse for older children and boys. Our evidence suggests that the impact of eviction on children runs through the disruption to the home environment or school engagement rather than deterioration in school or neighborhood quality, and may be moderated by access to family support networks.</content>

    <title>Substitution Bias and Fixed-Weight Price Indices in Time-Dependent Pricing Models</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper compares inflation in true price indices to inflation in fixed-weight price indices. We construct model-based inflation measures in time-dependent pricing models that are analogous to measures of inflation in the data, e.g., the Consumer Price Index. In the standard new Keynesian model, when inflation rises rapidly, the differences between inflation in those indices and true price indices are increasing in the degree of price stickiness and the elasticity of substitution across goods. For commonly used parameter values, those differences are large and persistent for increases in inflation of the size seen after 2020 in the U.S.</content>

    <title>Does Homeownership Matter? The Long-Term Consequences of Losing a House during the Great Recession</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the long-term impact of keeping versus losing one’s home following a mortgage delinquency in the aftermath of the Great Recession, studying the trajectory of homeownership, consumption, and financial well-being over the subsequent decade. Our research design leverages the substantial number of households that experienced temporary income shocks and the turbulence of the foreclosure crisis — we focus on individuals who were seriously delinquent on their mortgages and compare outcomes between those who received a mortgage modification and those who did not. These two groups exhibit highly similar pre-trends in financial outcomes prior and during the Great Recession but diverge by 36 percentage points in their short-term likelihood of retaining homeownership. More than half of this disparity persists nearly a decade later, translating into an average capital gain of $83,000 in the housing market. Despite these significant differences in homeownership and wealth accumulation, keeping a home does not appear to influence the path of creditworthiness, proxies for consumption, and the income rank of one's residential neighborhood.</content>

    <title>The Long Road to Equality: Racial Capital and Generational Convergence</title>
    <updated>2025-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce the concept of racial capital, defined as the collective material and non- material assets of the racial groups to which a child is exposed while growing up, and examine its potential to explain racial disparities in life outcomes that persist even after accounting for a broad range of parental and neighborhood resources. Estimates for Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White children born around 1980 imply that metro-level racial capital measures: (i) have substantial power to explain racial differences in life outcomes, (ii) sharply close and, in many cases, reverse the sign of racial intergenerational mobility gaps in education, income, and employment, and (iii) matter most when racial dissociation, as measured by residential and marriage segregation, is greatest. In contrast to standard estimates, our empirical framework implies a steady state equilibrium that is characterized by near equality for Black and White Americans. The inclusion of racial capital in the model, however, greatly slows the speed of convergence to the steady state, helping to explain the historically slow speed of racial economic convergence in the United States over the past two centuries. Finally, our framework highlights the complementary way that policies related to racial dissociation and wealth transfers affect the speed of convergence across generations.</content>

    <title>Global Networks, Monetary Policy and Trade</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a novel framework to study the interaction between monetary policy and trade. Our New Keynesian open economy model incorporates international production networks, sectoral heterogeneity in price rigidities, and trade distortions. We decompose the general equilibrium response to trade shocks into distinct channels that account for demand shifts, policy effects, exchange rate adjustments, expectations, price stickiness, and input–output linkages. Tariffs act simultaneously as demand and supply shocks, leading to endogenous fragmentation through changes in trade and production network linkages. We show that the net impact of tariffs on domestic inflation, output, employment, and the dollar depends on the endogenous monetary policy response in both the tariff-imposing and tariff-exposed countries, within a global general equilibrium framework. Our quantitative exercise replicates the observed effects of the 2018 tariffs on the U.S. economy and predicts a 1.6 pp decline in U.S. output, a 0.8 pp rise in inflation, and a 4.8% appreciation of the dollar in response to a retaliatory trade war linked to tariffs announced on “Liberation Day.” Tariff threats, even in the absence of actual implementation, are self-defeating—leading to a 4.1% appreciation of the dollar, 0.6% deflation, and a 0.7 pp decline in output, as agents re-optimize in anticipation of future distortions. Dollar appreciates less or even can depreciate under retaliation, tariff threats, and increased global uncertainty.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of a randomized therapy intervention on Nepali adolescents at risk of school dropout. Our study is the largest of its kind (N = 1,707) and is novel in that participation does not require a preexisting diagnosis. Ninety percent of those offered therapy participated, with younger adolescents demonstrating higher compliance. Among those who complied, therapy significantly reduced psychological distress, improved emotional regulation, and enhanced life perspective, even in individuals without baseline mental health issues. However, these improvements in well-being did not lead to increased school attendance or better cognitive performance, suggesting that additional interventions may be necessary to enhance educational engagement in low-resource settings.</content>

    <title>Interventionist Preferences and the Welfare State: The Case of In-Kind Aid</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why is in-kind aid a prominent feature of welfare systems? We present a lab-in-the-field experiment involving members of the general U.S. population and SNAP recipients. After documenting a widespread desire to limit recipients’ choices, we quantify the relative importance of (i) welfarist motives, (ii) utility or disutility derived from curtailing another’s autonomy, and (iii) absolutist attitudes concerning the appropriate form of aid. Choices primarily reflect the two non-welfarist motives. Because people systematically misperceive recipient preferences, their interventions are more restrictive than they intend. Interventionist preferences and non-welfarist motives are more pronounced among the political right, particularly when recipients are black.</content>

    <title>The Long-Run Impacts of Mentoring Underrepresented Minority Groups in Economics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a long-run evaluation of one of the oldest professional mentoring programs for underrepresented groups in economics, the American Economic Association Mentoring Program (AEAMP). The AEAMP was established to address the underrepresentation of racial/ethnic minority groups by mentoring doctoral students and new Ph.D.s in economics. We compare professional outcomes of mentees with similar individuals from the same Ph.D. cohort who did not participate in the program. While there are no differences for many outcomes, mentees are more likely to hold a tenure-track or tenured position. Our results point to the potential for mentoring programs to address persistent racial/ethnic disparities.</content>

    <title>Labor Market Polarization and Inequality: A Roy Model Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the forces driving polarization and higher wage inequality since 1980 using a structural model of occupation choice in the tradition of Roy (1951). In our model, changes in relative occupational skill prices proxy for changes in relative demand for occupational labor services. Our analysis yields three main findings. First, although changes in skill prices have quantitatively important effects on employment shares and mean wages, they play essentially no role in accounting for the sharp rise in wage inequality. Second, changes in relative wages are driven by changes in higher order moments and do not reflect changes in relative demand. Third, changes in the variance of idiosyncratic within occupation productivity are the dominant factor behind the sharp rise in inequality.</content>

    <title>Taxes and Private Firms’ Capital Structure Choices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using limitations to the deductibility of interest payments triggered by the introduction of interest ceiling rules globally, we show that affected private firms reduce leverage relative to unaffected firms. In support of a causal effect of taxes on corporate capital structure choices, we show that the results hold for firms near the thresholds triggering the limitations, in a propensity score matched sample, and in countries required to adopt the interest ceiling rules. In contrast, falsification tests show no reduction in leverage for affected firms around pseudo-reform years. Furthermore, within a country, firms with a higher fraction of nondeductible interest payments are less responsive to tax rate changes. More broadly, across 93 countries, we document that private firms tend to decrease leverage in response to tax rate cuts and increase leverage in response to corporate tax rate hikes.</content>

    <title>How Good is AI at Twisting Arms? Experiments in Debt Collection</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How good is AI at persuading humans to perform costly actions? We study calls made to get delinquent consumer borrowers to repay. Regression discontinuity and a randomized experiment reveal that AI is substantially less effective than human callers. Replacing AI with humans six days into delinquency closes much of the gap. But borrowers initially contacted by AI have repaid 1% less of the initial late payment one year later and are more likely to miss subsequent payments than borrowers who were always called by humans. AI’s lesser ability to extract promises that feel binding may contribute to the performance gap.</content>

    <title>Scoring and Cartel Discipline in Procurement Auctions</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Auctioneers suspecting bidder collusion often lack the formal evidence needed for legal recourse. A practical alternative is to design auctions that hinder collusion. Since Abreu et al. (1986), economic theory has emphasized imperfect monitoring as a constraint on collusion, but evidence remains scarce on whether: (i) information frictions meaningfully limit real-world collusion; and (ii) auctioneers can effectively exploit these frictions. Indeed, transparency concerns often prevent the introduction of explicit randomness in auction design. We make progress on this issue by studying the impact of subjective scoring in auctions run by Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transportation. The adoption of scoring auctions significantly reduced winning bids in ways inconsistent with competition. Model-based inference suggests that the cartel’s dynamic obedience constraints were binding and were tightened by imperfect monitoring. Subjective scoring can successfully leverage imperfect monitoring frictions to reduce the scope of collusion.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents a holistic view of the channels of political influence of large corporations in modern democracies, focusing not only on well-studied instruments, such as campaign contributions and lobbying, but also on more opaque ones, such as charitable giving, political connections, dark money, public advocacy, and employee mobilization. Our quantitative perspective draws on recent work on US politics, including congressional voting, special interest politics, corporate political connections, grassroots, and philanthropic activities. In the process, the chapter offers also a discussion of recent methodological innovations around money in politics. We conclude with some considerations on corporate political disclosure.</content>

    <title>Quotas in General Equilibrium</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze economies with quotas and other quantity-based distortions. We show that any feasible, distorted allocation of resources can be implemented as the competitive equilibrium of an economy with quotas. Unlike economies with wedges, economies with quotas are constrained efficient and thus satisfy macro-envelope conditions. This means that the effects of changes in technologies, distortions, or policies can be expressed in terms of a small set of sufficient statistics. We provide a non-parametric and nonlinear characterization of the effects of quota and productivity changes on aggregate output. We also calculate the costs of misallocation due to quotas. These costs are expressed in terms of the price elasticities of an inverse demand system capturing how quota prices respond to changes in quota levels. We illustrate our results using several examples: we estimate efficiency gains from increasing the cap on H-1B visas, relaxing zoning restrictions on single-family housing in American cities, removing capital controls in Argentina, phasing out U.S. quotas on Chinese clothing and textiles, and eliminating the taxicab medallion system in New York City. Our results offer a flexible method for quantifying the costs of quota distortions and the effects of policy reforms across these settings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The decline in housing affordability over recent decades has promoted an enhanced interest in housing supply. This chapter presents descriptive evidence about the evolution of us housing prices, quantities, and regulations since 1980, indicating that supply constraints appear to be increasingly binding. We then provide an overview of the various approaches used to model construction and land development for homogeneous and heterogeneous housing in static and dynamic contexts to understand housing supply. Our treatment incorporates empirical implementation and policy implications throughout. Finally, we provide an overview of quantitative evidence on the consequences of relaxing various types of supply constraints.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Are defined contribution (DC) pension funds' capital flows sensitive to performance? We examine pressures from individual account holders who can switch their pension managers. Using novel data on retirement accounts for nearly 10 million individuals, we analyze switching behavior based on the plan’s risk profile. Switching across managers within the same pension product is not uncommon, and the tendency to change managers rises over time. Capital flows are sensitive to and increase with fund performance. This sensitivity creates pressure on managers, shaping their incentives and portfolio decisions. A quasi-exogenous increase in outflows leads managers to shift toward higher-yielding bond holdings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper considers questions about the implications of rising inequality for the theory and practice of public finance. It begins by addressing fundamental reasons why the distribution of income or wealth on an annual basis before taxes and transfers offers insufficient information: (1) it does not tell us what resources are actually available to households for consumption; and (2) in providing a snapshot of the resources available to individuals of different ages at a given moment in time, without controlling for life-cycle related differences or income dynamics, it can provide a misleading estimate of the underlying degree of inequality. The paper then considers the implications of high and perhaps rising economic inequality for the design of government policy: top marginal tax rates, phase-outs of government policies for those with higher incomes, the political economy of inequality, and other subjects.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mangroves provide vital ecosystem services like storm surge protection and carbon sequestration, but their coverage is rapidly declining. This study evaluates an environmental education program in the Dominican Republic, targeting children’s attitudes, knowledge, behaviors, and willingness to pay for conservation. The program boosted attitudes, especially in girls, with modest, non-significant behavioral changes. There were also positive spillover effects on peers and parents, with non-treated peers in clubs showing increased mangrove preference and positive attitude shifts in parents.</content>

    <title>The Risk Sensitivity of Global Liquidity Flows: Heterogeneity, Evolution and Drivers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The period after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) was characterized by a considerable risk migration within global liquidity flows, away from cross-border bank lending towards international bond issuance. We show that the post-GFC shifts in the risk sensitivities of global liquidity flows are related to the tightness of the balance sheet (capital and leverage) constraints faced by international (bank and non-bank) lenders and to the migration of borrowers across funding sources. We document that the risk sensitivity of global liquidity flows is higher when funding is provided by financial intermediaries that are facing greater balance sheet constraints. We also provide evidence that the post-GFC migration of borrowers from cross-border loans to international debt securities was associated with a decline in the risk sensitivity of global liquidity flows to EME borrowers.</content>

    <title>Pension Reform and Labor Supply: Retention and Productivity under a Pension Cut</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effect of a representative pension reform on the retention and productivity of workers. The reform cut pension annuities and early retirement benefits for public school teachers, projected to save eight percent of pension revenues. We leverage administrative records and a discontinuity in the reform to estimate its effect. Contrary to expectations, the cut increased retention by discouraging early retirement. Using idiosyncratic within-school variation in exposure, we find the reform somewhat increased student achievement by 0.01–0.03 standard deviations, partly through reduced turnover. The reform thus maintained or improved both teacher retention and productivity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops a complete-market production economy with heterogeneous beliefs about TFP growth. Hiring occurs before TFP is known and is, therefore, risky (operational leverage). The firm's discount factor depends on a wealth-weighted average of investors' beliefs. Waves of optimism influence asset markets and percolate to labor hiring, tying together the equity premium, equity volatility, and labor volatility puzzles. A taxonomy of belief systems shows that only extrapolative beliefs amplify the volatility of asset prices and hours and lead to risk build up. Disciplined by survey data, the model matches asset-pricing and business-cycle moments, highlighting how heterogeneous beliefs can be a direct driver of aggregate fluctuations.</content>

    <title>Paths to the Periphery</title>

      <name>James A. Robinson</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;My research suggests that world inequality is explained by the incidence of extractive and inclusive institutions. But why do some countries have extractive institutions? I distinguish between two main reasons; first, power relations; second, the “normative order.” Normative orders provide justifications and legitimacy for institutions which may not generate prosperity, but may achieve other goals. These distinctions are critical because they create very different challenges in trying to make institutions more inclusive and create prosperity. I show how countries move from the economic periphery as a consequence of changing both. My own intellectual journey has been in the other direction, however, hence the title of the paper: I was fortunate to be born in Britain, but I have had to unlearn much of my own experience, socialization and training in order to see other societies on their own terms. That’s crucial to be able to help them, but also to learn from them.</content>

    <title>Partisan Trust in the Federal Reserve</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines partisanship in public perceptions of the Federal Reserve. In all years from 2001 through 2023, trust in the Federal Reserve was highest for respondents of the same party as the President. The partisan effects were larger than other demographic differences in trust, but do not explain the large partisan gap in inflation expectations in those years. We conducted a new survey-based information experiment before and after the Presidential inauguration in 2025, and found a changed pattern: Republicans continued to have lower trust in the Fed than did Democrats, even after a Republican President was elected and took office. Yet, Republicans had much lower inflation expectations than Democrats. Responses to open-ended survey questions point to tariffs and President Trump himself as most salient to consumers when considering how inflation will evolve.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Training investments are essential for improving worker and firm productivity, yet their implementation is often hindered by low participation rates and insufficient worker engagement. This study uses data from three firms—a car manufacturer, a quick-service restaurant chain, and a retail company—to show that variation in training participation among employees is closely tied to differences in middle managers’ behavior and practices. Middle managers who actively engage with their employees and emphasize their well-being and development are associated with significantly higher participation in training programs. These managerial differences significantly influence employee performance and absenteeism, especially during periods of organizational change. Together, these findings underscore the importance of middle managers in bridging the gap between centrally designed HR policies and their effective on-the-ground execution.</content>

    <title>The Economics of Encouragement: Can A Simple Email Shape Major Choice?</title>

Using a regression discontinuity design, we find some evidence of an increase in the likelihood of enrolling in intermediate microeconomics, especially for first-generation college students and underrepresented minorities, but limited effects on major switching or declaring an economics minor.

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study whether gender differences in university major choices result from anticipated labor market discrimination. First, we document two novel facts using administrative transcript records from a large Midwestern university: women are less likely to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) as well as business and economics, but 1) those who do are positively selected on ability, and 2) obtain higher grades conditional on ability. Second, we show that these facts are consistent with a signaling model in which women anticipate greater labor market discrimination in STEM, business, and economics than in other fields. Third, we provide direct empirical evidence of anticipated discrimination using a student survey. The survey reveals striking patterns of anticipated discrimination by women, particularly in STEM, business, and economics, affecting both expected economic outcomes such as wages as well as expected workplace conditions. We conclude by showing that anticipated discrimination explains women's course taking and intended major choices, but not men's.</content>

    <title>Educational Ambition, Marital Sorting, and Inequality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper revisits the link between education-based marriage market sorting and income inequality. Leveraging Danish administrative data, we develop a novel categorization of “ambition types” that is based on starting wages and wage growth trajectories associated with detailed educational programs. We find a substantial increase in assortative matching by educational ambition over time, and the marriage market explains more than 40% of increasing inequality since 1980. In contrast, sorting trends are flat with the commonly-used educational level categorization. We conclude that the mapping from education to types matters crucially for conclusions about how education-based marriage market sorting contributes to rising income inequality.</content>

    <title>Measuring Income and Income Inequality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Income inequality is important, but attempts to measure it arrive at strikingly different conclusions. Why? We use recent disputes over measuring United States income inequality to return to first principles about both the income concept and inequality measurement. We emphasize two broad points. First, no measure of the income distribution is truly comprehensive, or could attempt to be comprehensive without making controversial choices. We document the practical and conceptual problems that the standard ideal—comprehensive Haig-Simons income—raises. Second, much of the controversy in this area turns on the many tradeoffs between starting with individual tax data versus attempting to match more expansive income concepts. Individual tax data reflects only a shrinking subset of a more comprehensive income concept—but it is individual data. Broader alternatives, on the other hand, are harder to allocate to individuals. We document some of the most important and contestable assumptions that allocating national income requires.</content>

    <title>Do Time-Constraints Matter? How, Why, and For Whom?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Exams are designed to rank students objectively by their abilities, including elements such as time limits, the number and difficulty of questions, and negative marking policies. Using data from a lab-in-field experiment, we develop and estimate a model of student behavior in multiple-choice exams that incorporates the effects of time constraints and use it to conduct policy analyses for designing more efficient exams in sorting students. We find that additional time benefits men more than women. Our estimated model shows that this is driven by gender differences in the signal production function for the correct answers. Time has a smaller impact on women, while ability and difficulty play a larger role. Risk aversion, in contrast to what is suggested in the literature, does not differ significantly by gender, and confidence rises with more time. Our policy experiments find that exams more effectively rank students when ranking is gender-specific and that time pressure, question difficulty, and student ability have non-monotonic effects on sorting.</content>

    <title>Firm Selection and Growth in Carbon Offset Markets: Evidence from the Clean Development Mechanism</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study carbon offsets sold by firms in China under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). We find that offset-selling firms, meant to cut carbon emissions, instead increase them by 49% after starting an offset project. In a model of firm investment decisions and offset review, we estimate that CDM firms increase emissions due to both the selection of higher-growth firms into projects (35 pp) and because offset projects themselves boost firm growth and therefore emissions (14 pp). The CDM reduces global surplus by causing damages from increased emissions four times greater than private gains from trade in the offset market.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a novel dataset of U.S. buyout and VC investments, we study the informativeness of fund managers’ interim valuation reports about portfolio companies on final outcomes. We find that when investors assess the performance of individual portfolio companies, they can do better than just relying on the most recent reported valuation. The history of reported valuations is also informative. Investments with greater past staleness or more frequent markdowns tend to perform more poorly in the future than other investments. We also find that the timing of an investment’s exit is predictable. Moreover, the combined knowledge of interim realized and unrealized returns, past staleness, and past markdown frequency can help predict whether an investment will end up in the left or right tail of all investments. These predictions are informative as early as the first year of the investment.</content>

    <title>Long-Run Effects of Trade Wars</title>
    <updated>2025-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>David Baqaee &amp; Hannes Malmberg</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This short note shows that accounting for capital adjustment is critical when analyzing the long-run effects of trade wars on real wages and consumption. The reason is that trade wars increase the relative price between investment goods and labor by taxing imported investment goods and their inputs. This price shift depresses capital demand, shrinks the long-run capital stock, and pushes down consumption and real wages compared to scenarios when capital is fixed. We illustrate this mechanism by studying recent US tariffs using a dynamic quantitative trade model. When the capital stock is allowed to adjust, long-run consumption and wage responses are both larger and more negative. With capital adjustment, U.S. consumption can fall by 2.6%, compared to 0.6% when capital is held fixed, as in a static model. That is, capital stock adjustment emerges as a dominant driver of long-run outcomes, more important than the standard mechanisms from static trade models — terms-of-trade effects and mis- allocation of production across countries.</content>

    <title>The Rise of Absorptive Research in Corporate America: 1945-1980</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the post-World War II “Golden Age” of American corporate research from 1945 to 1980, using multiple indicators of corporate research activity. We use an ensemble learning approach to classify firms as either Science Leaders, Absorbers or Followers. Our analysis reveals that only a small fraction of firms, whom we call Leaders, invest in internal research that is on the scientific frontier, with the objective to generate breakthrough inventions. Absorbers invest in research principally to absorb external scientific discoveries to fuel their inventive activity. Followers typically generate incremental innovations, using older scientific knowledge. Consistent with this, we find Leaders were more likely to be at the technological frontier, enjoy greater market power, and benefit from government procurement contracts. As universities and startups began to commercialize academic discoveries, the need for “absorptive corporate labs” declined. The shift ultimately transformed the American innovation landscape, deepening the division of innovative labor between universities, startups, and incumbent corporations, with only a select group of Leader firms continuing to invest in basic science.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how the political ideology of corporate leaders shapes cross-border firm networks. Exploiting changes in ideological alignment between U.S. firm CEOs and foreign governments around close foreign elections, we show that U.S. firms are more likely to terminate trade relationships with countries led by governments whose ideology becomes more distant from that of their CEOs. The impact is concentrated among CEOs holding strong political views, and is particularly pronounced for shorter trade relationships, suggesting ideological alignment is more relevant in more flexible and substitutable connections. Our findings highlight the role of ideology in shaping the formation and persistence of international firm networks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The analysis of corporate governance begins with a central feature of modern capitalism—the separation of ownership and control in large corporations—first empirically documented by Berle and Means (1932). Such separation entails several agency problems reflecting conflicts between managers and shareholders, such as self-dealing by managers, low effort, consumption of perquisites, and excessive growth and diversification. Berle and Means saw self-dealing as the central agency problem and stressed the law as the fundamental mechanism of addressing it. Jensen and Meckling (1976) considered the consumption of perquisites and emphasized private mechanisms, such as financial incentives for managers, to counter wasteful perks. Jensen (1986) instead focused on excessive growth and diversification, which led him to count on leverage and takeovers. The combination of public corporate governance mechanisms, mostly the law, and market governance shaped both theory and practice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Phone usage in the classroom has been linked to worsened academic outcomes. We present findings from a field experiment conducted at a large public university in partnership with an app marketed as a soft commitment device that provides incentives to reduce phone use in the classroom. We find that app usage led to improvements in classroom focus, attendance, and overall academic satisfaction. Analysis of time spent outside the classroom suggests a potential substitution effect: students using the app allocated less time to study, particularly on campus. Overall, though statistically insignificant, we find improvements in transcript grades associated with app usage.</content>

    <title>Did War Mobilization Cause Aggregate and Regional Growth?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The participation of the United States in World War II led to a substantial mobilization of domestic resources to produce the materiel used on the battlefields of Europe and in the Pacific. We produce new estimates for the impact of war mobilization on long-run economic growth and regional development in the United States over the postwar period. Guided by an economic geography model, we interpret our estimates as the direct effect of mobilization on local productivity. The findings suggest the largest likely aggregate welfare impact was modest, although there is variation across region. In addition, industrial mobilization contributed to manufacturing growth relatively more in the Northeast and Midwest, and less in the South and West.</content>

    <title>Fiscal Policy as a Stabilization Tool. The Case for Quasi-Automatic Stabilizers, With an Application to the VAT</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most of the focus of recent stabilization policy research and practice has been on monetary rather than fiscal policy. This paper explores how, given the limits on monetary policy, fiscal policy could play a larger role. It explores the use of quasi-automatic stabilizers, i.e. changes in taxes or transfers triggered by an aggregate variable. It discusses design issues, in particular how to make such stabilizers truly debt neutral, and what aggregate variable to use as a trigger. It then focuses on a specific stabilizer, a variable VAT rate. It shows its effect in a minimalist NK model, and then discusses a number of analytical issues, both within and out of the minimalist model, such as the implications for inflation, the choice of the tax base, the implications of liquidity constraints, the implication of anticipation effects. It ends by reviewing the empirical evidence on passthrough of VAT changes, and the effects on demand of VAT changes, permanent or temporary.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the effect of social media deactivation on users’ emotional state in two large randomized experiments before the 2020 U.S. election. People who deactivated Facebook for the six weeks before the election reported a 0.060 standard deviation improvement in an index of happiness, depression, and anxiety, relative to controls who deactivated for just the first of those six weeks. People who deactivated Instagram for those six weeks reported a 0.041 standard deviation improvement relative to controls. Exploratory analysis suggests the Facebook effect is driven by people over 35, while the Instagram effect is driven by women under 25.</content>

    <title>A Theory of Supply Function Choice and Aggregate Supply</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Modern theories of aggregate supply are built on the foundation that firms set prices and commit to producing whatever the market demands. We remove this strategic restriction and allow firms to choose supply functions, mappings that describe the prices charged at each quantity of production. Theoretically, we characterize firms’ optimal supply function choices in general equilibrium and study the resulting implications for aggregate supply. Aggregate supply flattens under lower inflation uncertainty, higher idiosyncratic demand uncertainty, and less elastic demand. Quantitatively, our theory can rationalize the flattening of aggregate supply during the Great Moderation and steepening during the 1970s and 2020s.</content>

    <title>How Tariffs Affect Trade Deficits</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the positive (not normative) effect of a permanent import tariff on trade deficits. We consider a two-period trade model with general preferences and technology. We first develop an aggregation result showing one can work with induced preferences over aggregate imports and exports. This simplifies the analysis considerably. Our main result provides a sufficient statistic to evaluate the impact of tariffs around free trade: tariffs reduce trade deficits if the Engel curves for aggregate imports and exports are convex. Convexity is more likely when goods, at the micro-level, shift between being imported, non-traded, or exported. If this extensive margin is inactive and Engel curves are linear, then a permanent tariff is neutral.</content>

    <title>The Law and Economics of Lawyers: Evidence from the Revolving Door in China’s Judicial System</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how power lawyers shape judicial and economic outcomes by studying the “revolving door” between judges and lawyers in China’s judicial system—namely, former judges who quit the bench to practice law. In otherwise identical lawsuits, revolving-door lawyers deliver 8−23% higher win rate for their clients. Their performance in home versus away courts suggests these gains stem from both “know how” and “know who.” We extend the theoretical framework of Dewatripont and Tirole (1999) to show that revolving-door lawyers create countervailing forces in society: they enhance judicial decision-making through evidence and reasoning, but also exploit strategic arguments and connections to bias outcomes in favor of their clients. We estimate a structural model of the judicial process to quantify these trade-offs and find that increasing the supply of power lawyers can have a non-monotonic effect on equilibrium judicial quality.</content>

    <title>Reducing Nutritional Disparities Through Targeted Pricing: Evidence from a Large Restaurant Chain</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nutritional disparities across socioeconomic groups contribute to health inequality in the U.S. This paper studies the role of heterogeneous consumer preferences in food choices and explores pricing policies that can promote healthier eating among disadvantaged consumers. Using detailed transaction-level data from a large fast-food restaurant chain, we show that consumers in disadvantaged neighborhoods tend to choose less healthy, higher-calorie items. We estimate a mixed logit discrete choice model to identify consumer preference heterogeneity across demographic groups. Lower-SES consumers display higher price sensitivity across items with varying nutritional quality and show flexibility in substituting between healthy and less healthy options. Counterfactual simulations show that modest, targeted price adjustments in disadvantaged neighborhoods can be an effective tool to reduce nutritional disparities across neighborhoods, with little impact on restaurant revenue or profits.</content>

    <title>Firm Presence, Pollution, and Agglomeration: Evidence from a Randomized Environmental Place-Based Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firm location decisions are a key managerial choice, usually optimized over factors like proximity to customers or  suppliers. These decisions may also impose externalities on the environment, and on other firms due to competitive or agglomerative forces. The inherent endogeneity of location decisions makes estimating the impact of firm presence difficult. In this paper, we study an environmental  place-based policy that randomly moved over 20,000 small firms  in New Delhi to industrial areas outside the city over several years. We find that a reduction in firm presence improves air quality, reducing industrial pollution by 8% for the average neighborhood. However, industrial relocation is costly for firms, significantly increasing the probability of firm exit. We combine the exogenous assignment of firms to industrial plots with a model of firms playing a game of incomplete information to estimate the effect of neighborhood composition on firm survival through Marshallian agglomeration forces. We find that proximity to neighboring firms with input-output linkages increases the likelihood of firm survival, and taking these into account while determining firm placement in industrial areas would have halved the costs imposed on firms by the policy. These results provide causal evidence on the trade-offs between firm presence and environmental quality, and show that firm spillovers can be a useful force to minimize the costs on regulated firms.</content>

    <title>Option Value Neglect: Evidence from Centralized College Admission</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sequential choices are ubiquitous in daily life, yet making optimal decisions in such settings—where properly accounting for option value is crucial—can be challenging. This paper provides field experimental evidence on the neglect of option value in high-stakes decisions and quantifies the associated welfare consequences. We study a centralized college admissions system where students submit brief preference lists. Although option value should encourage riskier top choices, many students are overly cautious and fail to include safer lower-ranked options. We argue that directed cognition—making myopic decisions while ignoring the value of subsequent options—explains this behavior. An in-field experiment targeting a key framing-based prediction shows that about 50% of applicants exhibit this pattern, especially among disadvantaged students. Counterfactual analysis suggests that de-biasing interventions could significantly reduce outcome gaps and improve overall efficiency.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Global Macro Database is an open-source, continuously updated dataset of macroeconomic statistics that unifies and extends existing resources. By harmonizing and integrating data from 32 major contemporary sources—including the IMF, World Bank, and OECD—with historical records from 78 additional datasets, we construct comprehensive annual time series for 46 variables across 243 countries. This database covers global macroeconomic trends from the origins of modern data collection to projected estimates for 2030. Using this extensive database, we study the long-run output losses of financial crises and global temperature shocks, two applications in which historical time series are a crucial input. Our findings show that financial crises are associated with statistically detectable contractions in real GDP for five decades into the future, which are considerably larger than previously estimated. Temperature shocks also predict real GDP contractions up to 30 years ahead, especially in emerging economies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Skewness is a prevalent feature of macroeconomic time series and may arise exogenously because shocks are asymmetrically distributed, or endogenously, as shocks propagate through production networks. Previous theoretical work often studies these two possibilities in isolation. We nest all possible sources of skewness in a model where output has a network, a common, and an idiosyncratic component. In this model, skewness can arise not only from the three components, but also from coskewness due to the higher order covariation between components. An analysis of output growth in 43 U.S. sectors shows that coskewness is a key source of asymmetry in the data and constitutes a connectivity channel not previously explored. To help interpret our results, we construct and estimate a micro-founded multi-sector general equilibrium model and show that it can generate skewness and coskewness consistent with the data.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this Handbook chapter, I examine how integrating ethnographic and folklore records has shaped research on culture and economics in the 21st century. Advances in text analysis techniques and the incorporation of historical and satellite data have transformed the field. I explore how George Peter Murdock's ethnographic contributions and Yuri Berezkin's seminal folklore motif index have been utilized to shed light on the roots of comparative development. I conclude by proposing a methodology for leveraging Large Language Models to extract cultural insights from folklore motifs, demonstrating how ancestral narratives can complement ethnographic records and offer valuable perspectives on societal norms and the historical forces shaping economic behavior today.</content>

    <title>Health Impacts of Federal Pandemic Aid to State and Local Governments</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented levels of federal transfers to state and local governments. Did this funding impact population health? To answer this question, we leverage the fact that U.S. states that enjoy excess representation in Congress received substantially more fiscal assistance than did relatively underrepresented states. We find that the aid driven by excess representation had substantial impacts on population health. For each $1,000 increase in federal fiscal aid per state resident, we estimate that states experienced 38 fewer deaths from all causes per 100,000 residents from 2020 through 2022, of which 2/3 came from reductions in COVID-19 mortality. We estimate that the last $331 billion in federal pandemic aid, which corresponds with  our in-sample variation, generated $591 billion in value through life years saved. Additional aid also reduced rates of COVID-19 related hospitalizations and emergency room visits, though not in the total number of positive cases detected. Plausible mechanisms for these improved outcomes include higher rates of COVID-19 vaccination, which plausibly account for nearly half of the mortality reductions we observe, and higher rates of COVID-19 testing. Medicaid enrollments and hospital capacity do not appear to play substantial mediating roles. Our robustness analyses provide evidence that the effects we estimate cannot be explained by pre-existing mortality trends, by the pandemic's differential impacts on relatively dense vs. rural areas, or by the pandemic's differential impacts on populations with more elderly individuals or with higher prevalence of chronic conditions. The mortality impacts we estimate were substantially greater for non-Hispanic Black Americans than for non-Hispanic White Americans, such that federal funds are associated with a reduction in population-wide health disparities over the course of the pandemic.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Utilities increasingly sell electricity using complex menus of time-constant and time-varying price schedules. We study how to design such a menu to maximize social welfare in a second best environment where the marginal private and external costs of generating electricity vary over time, institutional constraints prevent mandating time-varying pricing, and consumer behavior is distorted by frictions. We develop a model of plan choice, consumption, and intertemporal substitution with time-varying marginal social costs, and estimate it using administrative data from a large utility. We provide evidence of substantial intertemporal substitution in response to time-varying price incentives, and selection across plans based on multidimensional heterogeneity. While the current menu’s time-varying plans substantially shift consumption from high-price to low-price hours, we find that they reduce social welfare. This loss is mitigated by information frictions. We show how to redesign the menu to simultaneously improve outcomes for consumers, the utility, and the environment.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Global value chains (GVC) are a pervasive feature of modern production, but they are hard to measure. Using confidential microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau, we develop novel measures of the linkages between U.S. manufacturing establishments’ imports and exports. We document three new GVC patterns. First, for every dollar of exports, imported inputs represent 13 cents in 2002 and 20 cents by 2017, substantially higher than what aggregate data suggests. Second, we find strong complementarities between input and output markets reflected in “round-trip” trade linkages where an establishment sources inputs from and exports output to the same country. Third, we find a strong positive association between regional trade agreements and GVC trade flows. The aggregate data used to build global input-output tables requires proportionality assumptions that we find mute these relationships. Finally, with a simple model, we show that the round-trip results are consistent with a notion of firm and country-specific fixed costs that are at least partially common between sourcing (imports) and foreign sales (exports).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) policies, as currently being implemented by the EU and UK. Policy discussions have cited three motivations and one concern. CBAMs can improve domestic competitiveness in regulated markets, reduce emissions leakage to unregulated markets, and encourage other countries to tax carbon. But CBAMs may particularly disadvantage lower-income trading partners. We evaluate these forces with a quantitative equilibrium model and plant-level data on aluminum and steel production worldwide. Our data cover the most emissions-intensive and heavily traded sectors targeted in the first phase of EU and UK implementation. We find that CBAMs can effectively boost competitiveness, curb leakage, and encourage regulation, while also avoiding disproportionate impacts on lower-income countries.</content>

    <title>Screening Through Soft Spending Limits: Evidence from the Medicare Therapy Cap</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Governments and firms often employ soft spending limits to restrict overspending while still allowing exceptions on a case-by-case basis. This paper studies a Medicare policy which capped per-patient physical therapy spending, with exceptions for patients with documented medical need.  The cap reduced spending by 8 percent without harming patient health, with the targeting improvements driven by Medicare discretion in granting exceptions rather than improved provider screening. However, the documentation requirement also introduced horizontal inequity: conditional on need, lower-income and minority patients were more likely to be screened out, as they tended to see providers with poorer documentation practices.</content>

    <title>Local Energy Access and Industry Specialization: Evidence from World War II Emergency Pipelines</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does improving access to the supply of energy affect regional specialization in manufacturing? We evaluate the long-run employment impacts of pipelines constructed by the U.S. government during World War II to transport oil and gas from the oil fields of the Southwest to wartime industrial producers in the Northeast. The pipelines were built rapidly to connect end points along a direct path that minimized use of scarce construction materials. Postwar they were converted to supply en route customers, giving counties close to the pipelines access to a cheap and plentiful source of energy. Between 1940 and 1950, counties with better access to pipeline gas had larger increases in their share of employment in energy-intensive industries. These impacts persisted to the mid-1980s for all energy-intensive industries and to the late 1990s for the subset of industries intensive in the direct use of electricity, despite the disruptive effects of the 1970s energy crisis. Our findings are relevant for understanding energy-related path dependence in local economic development patterns and how government intervention in energy markets affects industry location in the short and long run.</content>

    <title>Field Choice, Skill Specificity, and Labor Market Disruptions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We argue that college students’ field-of-study choices significantly influence how economies respond to labor market disruptions. To do so, we develop and estimate a framework featuring forward-looking students who choose a field of study when entering college, and subsequently make decisions over occupations after graduating and entering the labor market. Different fields endow workers with distinct comparative advantages and varying costs associated with switching occupations. Simulating both a trade war and wide scale adoption of AI, we use our model to make three points. First, relative to models that ignore how new cohorts adjust their field-of-study choices, our framework predicts larger aggregate income responses and greater distributional differences. Second, policies that enhance flexibility in field-of-study decisions—such as relaxing capacity constraints in high-demand programs—raise aggregate output. Finally, these policies also lessen the adverse distributional consequences of shocks, by affording more opportunities to students with lower earnings potential.</content>

    <title>Protection for Whom? The Political Economy of Protective Labor Laws for Women</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;During the first half of the twentieth century, many US states enacted laws restricting women's labor market opportunities, including maximum hours restrictions, minimum wage laws, and night-shift bans. The era of so-called protective labor laws came to an end in the 1960s as a result of civil rights reforms. In this paper, we investigate the political economy behind the rise and fall of these laws. We argue that the main driver behind protective labor laws was men's desire to shield themselves from labor market competition. We spell out the mechanism through a politico-economic model in which singles and couples work in different sectors and vote on protective legislation. Restrictions are supported by single men and couples with male sole earners who compete with women for jobs. We show that the theory's predictions for when protective legislation will be introduced are well supported by US state-level evidence.</content>

    <title>Taming Cycles: China’s Growth Targets and Macroeconomic Management</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;China’s hybrid economy blends state planning with market mechanisms, using annual economic targets to guide development and macroeconomic management to ensure their achievement. Local governments set ambitious growth targets to align with central mandates and incentivize subordinates, leading to asymmetric adjustments: targets rise rapidly during booms but decline sluggishly during slowdowns. This dynamic has heightened pressure on local governments to intervene in the economy, particularly after 2010. Our analysis shows that when a region falls short of its growth target, it increases infrastructure investment, land sales, and local government debt to close the gap. Notably, during the relatively stable period of 2011–2019, overly optimistic targets contributed an additional 14.0% of GDP to local government debt. While these interventions helped smooth cyclical fluctuations and moderated the trend of GDP deceleration, they also eroded GDP growth’s reliability as an economic indicator, weakening its correlation with corporate revenue, household demand, and TFP gains.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;At the onset of COVID-19, U.S. labor-force participation dropped by about 3 percentage points and remained below pre-pandemic levels three years later. Recovery varied across states, with slower rebounds in those more affected by the pre-pandemic opioid crisis, as measured by age-adjusted opioid overdose death rates. An event study shows that a one-standard-deviation increase in pre-COVID opioid death rates corresponds to a 0.9 percentage point decline in post-COVID labor participation. The result is not driven by differences in overall health between states. The effect of prior opioid exposure had a more significant impact on individuals without a college degree. The slow recovery in states with more opioid exposure was characterized by an increase in individuals who are not in the labor force due to disability.</content>

    <title>Regulating Out-of-Network Hospital Payments: Disagreement Payoffs, Negotiated Prices, and Access</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent policy proposals seek to regulate out-of-network hospital prices. We study how such regulation affects equilibrium prices, network formation, and hospital exit. We estimate a structural model of insurer-hospital bargaining that allows for out-of-network transactions between non-contracting parties. These transactions generate a notion of exit by rendering hospitals unprofitable under some regulations. Estimation relies on a novel measure of out-of-network prices. We find that reducing out-of-network prices would also lower negotiated prices, but potentially at the cost of narrower hospital networks. Aggressive regulation could induce substantial hospital exit, but only under the restrictive assumption that negotiators cannot anticipate the exits.</content>

    <title>The Macroeconomics of Tariff Shocks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the short-run effects of import tariffs on GDP and the trade balance in an open-economy New Keynesian model with intermediate input trade. We find that temporary tariffs cause a recession whenever the import elasticity is below an openness-weighted average of the export elasticity and the intertemporal substitution elasticity. We argue this condition is likely satisfied in practice because durable goods generate great scope for intertemporal substitution, and because it is easier to lose competitiveness on the global market than to substitute between home and foreign goods. Unilateral tariffs do tend to improve the trade balance, but when other countries retaliate the trade balance worsens and the recession deepens. Taking into account the recessionary effect of tariffs dramatically brings down the optimal unilateral tariff level derived in standard trade theory.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Amid rising global interest in state interventions, this paper examines how China’s infrastructure investments—a key macroeconomic policy tool—affect firm productivity. We focus on a policy that encourages regional governments to improve market conditions for private enterprises. Our analysis shows that a better market environment amplifies infrastructure investment spillovers. However, the overall impact remains neutral or negative despite greater gains in industries with improved market access. These findings highlight the complex interplay between state intervention and market forces, raising concerns about the effectiveness of infrastructure investments in sustaining growth, especially in regions with weak market institutions.</content>

    <title>Using Multiple Outcomes to Adjust Standard Errors for Spatial Correlation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Empirical research in economics often examines the behavior of agents located in a geographic space. In such cases, statistical inference is complicated by the interdependence of economic outcomes across locations. A common approach to account for this dependence is to cluster standard errors based on a predefined geographic partition. A second strategy is to model dependence in terms of the distance between units. Dependence, however, does not necessarily stop at borders and is typically not determined by distance alone. This paper introduces a method that leverages observations of multiple outcomes to adjust standard errors for cross-sectional dependence. Specifically, a researcher, while interested in a particular outcome variable, often observes dozens of other variables for the same units. We show that these outcomes can be used to estimate dependence under the assumption that the cross-sectional correlation structure is shared across outcomes. We develop a procedure, which we call Thresholding Multiple Outcomes (TMO), that uses this estimate to adjust standard errors in a given regression setting. We show that adjustments of this form can lead to sizable reductions in the bias of standard errors in calibrated U.S. county-level regressions. Re-analyzing nine recent papers, we find that the proposed correction can make a substantial difference in practice.</content>

    <title>When Do FOMC Voting Rights Affect Monetary Policy?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using 472 FOMC meetings (1969–2019) and the exogenous rotation of voting rights among Reserve Bank presidents, we identify meetings where local economic conditions in voting districts significantly affect the Federal funds target rate (FFR), while those in non-voting districts show no effect. This voting-group effect persists after controlling for national conditions and Greenbook forecasts, implying that actual FFR decisions plausibly deviated from what average information and expectations would have suggested. Distortions are sizable, persistent, and priced into futures and Treasury markets prior to FOMC meetings. We demonstrate these findings using both components of the Fed’s dual mandate: inflation and unemployment rates.</content>

    <title>Mobile Crisis Response Teams Support Better Policing: Evidence from CAHOOTS</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the use of mobile crisis response teams—a non-uniformed pair consisting of a mental health worker and a medic—as a component of emergency response to 911 calls. We provide the first evaluation of the longest-running program in the United States, Crisis Assistance Helping Out on the Streets (CAHOOTS) in Eugene, Oregon, which responds to calls involving mental illness, homelessness, and addiction either instead of or in addition to police officers. We use two complementary research designs to understand the effects and possible scope of these programs. First, we find that a series of program expansions into new areas and times reduced the likelihood that a 911 call resulted in an arrest and increased access to medical services. The arrest reduction likely reflects CAHOOTS’ role in de-escalating tense situations and resolving incidents without coercive measures. CAHOOTS is most often dispatched to the same calls as the police, acting as a supplement rather than a substitute. Second, we exploit idiosyncratic variation in CAHOOTS availability in the post-expansion periods to estimate the effect of additional marginal program expansions. We find that they are used mostly for calls that would otherwise go unanswered, suggesting that the program has reached a scale where it can respond to the most urgent calls. We conclude that crisis response teams play an important role as a complement to the police rather than acting only as substitutes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greater reliance on nonbank financing makes firms fragile as it leads banks to limit their access to credit lines. Besides demonstrating this result in panel tests subject to range of controls and robustness checks, we employ the 2014–16 oil-price collapse as an exogenous rollover risk in nonbank financing of non-oil-sector firms by collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) exposed to oil sector firms. Nonbank-reliant firms with looming maturities faced reductions and wider spreads in bank credit lines after the shock, resulting in weaker financial and real performance in spite of their drawdowns of existing credit lines.</content>

    <title>Optimal Tariffs When Labor Income Taxes Are Distortionary</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A classic result in trade theory is that it is socially optimal to set the tariff on a good equal to the inverse of the elasticity of its foreign supply. However, this result is based on the assumption that the government can use lump-sum taxes. The paper considers a simple open representative agent economy and characterizes second-best tariffs when the government's only non-tariff source of revenue is linear labor income taxation. If public spending needs are sufficiently large, and import demand is more (less) income-elastic than non-import demand, then the second-best tariff is lower (higher) than the standard optimal tariff.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Child maltreatment is a major public health concern in the United States. Maltreatment is associated with a range of poor health, developmental, and economic outcomes for child victims. In this study, we examine the impact of recent state paid sick leave mandates on child maltreatment reports over the period 2011-2022. Paid sick leave mandates confer financially protected time that can be used for health and family responsibilities as well as for actions such as court hearings that can reduce exposure to domestic violence. These benefits may also reduce maltreatment reports. Using difference-in-differences and event-study methods, we find that child maltreatment reports decline by 11% following the adoption of a state paid sick leave mandate. An analysis of mechanisms suggests that increases in parental and child health, family economic standing, childcare provision, and healthcare are important channels linking paid sick leave mandates to child maltreatment reports.</content>

    <title>Global Shocks, Institutional Development, and Trade Restrictions: What Can We Learn from Crises and Recoveries Between 1990 and 2022?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic were two major shocks to the world economy in the 21st century. In this study, we analyze the patterns of recessions and recoveries of 101 advanced and developing economies. We identify the turning points of recessions and expansions between 1990 and 2022, and perform cross-country analysis of domestic and external drivers of economic recovery. In addition to the standard independent variables, we include institutional development, political stability, the extent of democracy, and trade restrictions indexes, and explore their roles in explaining recessions and recovery patterns. For the whole sample, we find that deeper recessions are followed by stronger recoveries, in line with Friedman’s plucking model of the business cycle. However, the empirical evidence for the plucking model becomes weaker if institutional development is limited and trade restrictions are high. We show that recessions that create conflict and trade tensions differ sharply from those that do not, a highly relevant finding in the current global climate of heightened trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainty. Finally, since developing countries tend to have weaker institutions and higher trade barriers, our evidence suggests that if policy-makers seek to cushion global shocks, they will need to rely on countercyclical monetary and fiscal policy. Implementation of such policies is generally facilitated by robust and credible monetary and fiscal policy frameworks.</content>

      <name>Nick Huntington-Klein, Claus C. Portner, Ian McCarthy &amp; The Many Economists Collaborative on Researcher Variation</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use a rigorous three-stage many-analysts design to assess how different researcher decisions—specifically data cleaning, research design, and the interpretation of a policy question—affect the variation in estimated treatment effects. A total of 146 research teams each completed the same causal inference task three times each: first with few constraints, then using a shared research design, and finally with pre-cleaned data in addition to a specified design. We find that even when analyzing the same data, teams reach different conclusions. In the first stage, the interquartile range (IQR) of the reported policy effect was 3.1 percentage points, with substantial outliers. Surprisingly, the second stage, which restricted research design choices, exhibited slightly higher IQR (4.0 percentage points), largely attributable to imperfect adherence to the prescribed protocol. By contrast, the final stage, featuring standardized data cleaning, narrowed variation in estimated effects, achieving an IQR of 2.4 percentage points. Reported sample sizes also displayed significant convergence under more restrictive conditions, with the IQR dropping from 295,187 in the first stage to 29,144 in the second, and effectively zero by the third. Our findings underscore the critical importance of data cleaning in shaping applied microeconomic results and highlight avenues for future replication efforts.</content>

    <title>Should I Stay or Should I Go? The Response of Labor Migration to Economic Shocks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the responsiveness of labor participation, unemployment and labor migration to exogenous variations in labor demand. Our empirical approach considers four instruments for regional labor demand commonly used in the literature. Empirically, we find that labor migration is a significant margin of adjustment for all our instruments. Following an increase in regional labor demand, the initial increase in employment is accounted for mainly through a reduction in unemployment. Over time however, net labor in-migration becomes the dominant factor contributing to increased regional employment. After 5 years, roughly 60 percent of the increase in employment is explained by the change in population. Responses of labor migration are strongest for individuals aged 20-35. Based on historical data back to the 1950s, we find no evidence of a decline in the elasticity of migration to changes in employment.</content>

    <title>From Delay to PayDay: Easing Bureaucrat Access to Implementation Information Strengthens Social Protection Delivery</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Poor implementation frequently impedes social protection delivery in low-state-capacity settings. In such environments, reducing managers' information acquisition costs may improve their grasp of frontline issues and program performance. However, in the presence of managerial rent-seeking, increasing the principal's information may be key, and doing so just for managers can backfire. To assess this trade-off and implications for program performance, we collaborated with two Indian states to randomly vary bureaucrat access to “PayDash”, a digital platform for real-time tracking of worker payment processing for the national rural workfare program. In treated districts, PayDash expedited bureaucrat processing of workfare payments by 17%, and increased available worksites and participating household work days by 23% and 10%, respectively. Work provision rose relatively more during the agricultural lean season. PayDash has the same impact when offered to principals as to managers, and no further gains when offered to both, indicating that manager effort to acquire information constrains implementation. Consistent with information allowing principals to better condition performance incentives on managerial effort, PayDash for principals reduced manager posting transfers by 24%. PayDash strengthened state capacity at a considerably lower cost than hiring staff, while benefiting rural Indians by more than 170 times the costs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Finding new international suppliers is costly, so most importers source inputs from a single country. We examine the role of banks in mitigating trade search costs during the 2018–2019 U.S.-China trade tensions. We match data on shipments to U.S. ports with the U.S. credit register to analyze trade and bank credit relationships at the bank-firm level. We show that importers of tariff-hit products from China were more likely to exit relationships with Chinese suppliers and to find new suppliers in other Asian countries. To finance their geographic diversification, tariff-hit firms increased credit demand, drawing on bank credit lines and taking out loans at higher rates. Banks offering specialized trade finance services to Asian markets eased both financial and information frictions. Tariff-hit firms with specialized banks borrowed at lower rates and were 15 pps more likely and 3 months faster to establish new supplier relationships than firms with other banks. We estimate the cost of searching for suppliers at $1.9 million (or 5% of annual sales revenue) for the average U.S. importer.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents a framework to standardize crowd-sourced computational reproductions in economics through the Social Science Reproduction Platform (SSRP). The approach address four main challenges for computational reproductions: a lack of standardization, aggregation issues, existing incentives for “adversarial” interactions, and the loss of knowledge from analyses that are never published. We then summarize the first 487 reproductions uploaded on the SSRP. The results show substantial heterogeneity in the ability to successfully reproduce empirical results in economics research, with approximately 30% of recent studies meeting at least a basic definition of being computationally reproducible.</content>

    <title>Bureaucratic Incentives and Effectiveness of the One Child Policy in China</title>
    <updated>2025-05-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;China’s total fertility rate declined very little following implementation of the One Child Policy (OCP) in 1979/1980, but then fell sharply, by more than one-third, during the early 1990s. In this paper, we propose that strengthening bureaucratic incentives under the “One Vote Veto” (OVV) policy, which strictly prohibited career promotion for adherence failure, was necessary for more “effective” implementation of the OCP—and for its delayed impact on fertility. We use provincial variation in OVV implementation to estimate event study regression inputs needed to build actual and counterfactual sequential multi-decrement fertility life tables, finding that the policy explains 46% of China’s total fertility rate decline during the 1990s, driving it below replacement level. Use of intrauterine devices (IUDs, the most prevalent form of modern contraception in China) that was “recommended” by party officials increased by 133% under the policy, a relative increase more than four times as large as the increase in “voluntary” use. Overall, our paper suggests that population policy made a larger contribution to low fertility in China than suggested by past research. More generally, our paper highlights the central role of aligning bureaucratic incentives with public policy objectives, even in a centrally-planned economy like China’s.</content>

    <title>Climate Boards: Do Natural Disaster Experiences Make Directors More Prosocial?</title>
    <updated>2025-05-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Sehoon Kim, Bernadette A. Minton &amp; Rohan G. Williamson</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that corporate directors’ past experience with abnormally severe climatic natural disasters shape their prosocial preferences and influence firm climate policies. Using detailed data on director career histories and county-level natural disasters, we identify Directors with Abnormal Disaster Experiences (DADEs). DADEs are significantly more likely to be affiliated with nonprofit organizations, consistent with heightened prosocial preferences. Importantly, firms with more DADEs on their boards exhibit lower scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emission intensities and are more likely to implement climate-related policies, including board climate oversight, emission targets, and management incentives to reduce emissions. These effects are driven by influential DADEs serving on governance, audit, or ESG committees, but absent among DADEs on finance, compensation, or risk committees, supporting a preference-based rather than risk-based mechanism. Independent directors, rather than the influence of CEOs, play a central role. The effects are stronger when disaster experiences are accumulated over longer histories and in large or high-emission firms. The results are muted in smaller disasters and not driven by recent trends in attention to climate change. Despite the role of preferences, firms with more DADEs do not exhibit worse financial or operational performance. Using director deaths as plausibly exogenous shocks, we provide causal evidence. Our findings show that directors’ experiences heighten their prosocial preferences that lead them to influence corporate climate policy.</content>

    <title>Putting US Fiscal Policy on a Sustainable Path</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Even allowing for substantial uncertainty regarding projections, current US fiscal policies are almost certainly unsustainable. Therefore, policymakers must decide when and in what ways to change policies. Changing policies sooner rather than later would put debt on a lower trajectory and thereby increase national savings and provide insurance against adverse developments by expanding fiscal space, protecting against a persistent shortfall in economic growth, and reducing the chance of a fiscal crisis. Yet, the probability of a near-term fiscal crisis is difficult to assess: Yields on Treasury debt are within their range of the past few decades, which suggests that investors are not that worried about the fiscal outlook—but debt and deficits are at nearly unprecedented levels, and experience shows that investors’ confidence in a government’s fiscal management can deteriorate quickly.</content>

    <title>How Much Can Families Afford to Pay for College?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies families’ capacity to pay for college in the United States, focusing on changes over time and differences by race and socioeconomic status. I use data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) to document changes over time in the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The results suggest that the EFC has been rising over time, and that this has been driven primarily by families in the upper quartile of the income distribution. I then use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to calculate alternative measures of the ability to pay for college. I find that it is possible to alter the distribution of who pays what amount by changing details of the EFC calculation, but the extent of this depends on details of the implementation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine nonpecuniary preferences across a broad set of corporate actions using a representative sample of the U.S. population. Our core findings, based on large-scale online surveys, are that (i) self-reported nonpecuniary concerns are large both for stock market investors and non-investors; (ii) concerns about the treatment of workers and CEO pay rank highest—higher than concerns about workforce diversity and fossil energy usage; (iii) moral universalism emerges as an important driver of nonpecuniary preferences. Combined, our findings provide new evidence on the importance of moral concerns as a key determinant of nonpecuniary preferences over corporate actions.</content>

    <title>The Power of Persuasion: Causal Effects of Household Communication on Women's Employment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In many economic settings, agents lack decision rights but provide input. Intra-household decision-making in contexts with restrictive gender norms is one important example; wives often lack final say over decisions but still give input. Their ability to communicate persuasively while providing input could sway decisions in their favor. We conduct a field experiment in rural India to test whether an effective communication training among married women impacts their labor supply, the most common topic of intra-household disagreement in the sample. The treatment shifted women's communication styles towards the techniques taught in the training. We find positive effects on labor supply and earnings but, consistent with theory, only for women who at baseline were more interested than their husbands in the women working. These effects persist to at least one year following the treatment, leading to a nearly 60% increase in earnings over this period. Mechanisms analyses suggest the changes in labor supply are not due to shifts in bargaining power but rather come from women changing their husbands' preferences about female employment.</content>

    <title>The Myth of U.S. Dollar Dominance in Japanese Exports: New Evidence from Japanese Customs Level Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While Japanese exports are generally considered invoiced mainly in U.S. dollars (USD), this study presents contrary evidence that most Japanese firms choose yen-invoiced exports. Surprisingly, only the top one percent of firms in size tend to choose USD-invoiced exports, based on the Japan Customs export declaration data that was newly made available to researchers. By conducting fixed-effect panel estimation using the granular Japan Customs transaction data, combined with the most comprehensive firm-level data compiled by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), we demonstrate that the firm size and the intra-firm export share significantly reduce yen-invoiced exports. Smaller firms with few overseas subsidiaries tend to choose yen-invoiced exports to avoid foreign exchange risk. In contrast, larger firms efficiently manage foreign exchange risk arising from USD-invoiced exports, since they tend to export to overseas subsidiaries and benefit from operational hedging that offsets USD-denominated import payments with export revenues within group companies. Smaller firms would continue to choose yen-invoice exports unless they can benefit from operational hedging.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects of cigarette excise taxes on smokers’ household budgets. In a randomized survey experiment, smokers respond to tax increases by adjusting cigarette shopping behaviors, substituting towards other tobacco products, and reducing both discretionary and human capital-related expenditures. Using Consumer Expenditure Survey data and a quasi-experimental design, we find cigarette taxes reduce smoking prevalence but increase cigarette expenditures among continuing smokers. Additionally, a $1 increase in cigarette taxes causes a 2.12% decline in human capital-related expenditures among below median income smokers. Our work uncovers important unintended consequences of cigarette taxes, particularly for low-income individuals.</content>

    <title>Evaluating Recent Crackdowns on Disability Benefits: Effects on Income and Health Care Use in Australia</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many developed countries have enacted reforms to reduce enrollment in disability benefits (DI). We evaluate the effects of a DI crackdown in Australia on the most comprehensive set of outcomes available to date, including earnings, government benefits, family income, and health care utilization. Using a 2014 reform to Australia’s Disability Support Pension, we find that, on average, DI removal has a net zero effect on household income but leads to an increase in prescriptions for strong mental health drugs. However, average effects mask heterogeneity by family structure. For removed recipients living with family, family members increase their earnings by enough to offset the lost DI income, with minimal increase in mental health prescriptions. In contrast, removed recipients living alone do not increase their own earnings or have family support, but their use of strong mental health drugs increases dramatically. We develop a welfare analysis that considers multiple margins of behavioral adjustment. We find that behavioral adjustments offset more than half of the private welfare loss for recipients living with family but very little for those living alone. Government savings exceed household willingness to pay for DI for those living with family, but not for those living alone.</content>

    <title>Place Based Economic Development and Tribal Casinos</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Tribal lands in the U.S. have historically experienced some of the worst economic conditions in the nation. We review some existing research on the effect of American Indian tribal casinos on various measures of local economic development. This is an industry that began in the early 1990s and currently generates more than $40 billion annually. We also review the state of the literature on the effects of casino operations on communities in or adjacent to tribal areas. Using a new dataset linking individual and enterprise-level data longitudinally, this study examines the industry- and location-specific impacts of tribal casino operations. We focus in particular on the employment of American Indians. We document positive flows from unemployment and non-casino geographies to work in sectors related to casino operations. Tribal casinos differ from other standard place-based economic development projects in that they are focused on a single industry; we discuss these differences and note that some of the positive spillover effects may be similar to other, more standard place-based policies. Finally, we discuss additional and open-ended questions for future research on this topic.</content>

    <title>Tariff Wars and Net Foreign Assets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This note addresses whether and when a trade war that imposes balanced trade (or even zero trade) can be consistent with initial non-zero net foreign asset positions. Using a bilateral trade model, we exploit insights from the classic literature on the Transfer Problem to characterize when gross asset or liability positions and tariff policies generate an endogenous terms-of-trade effect that ensures the value of assets and liabilities balance. As long as gross positions denominated in different goods differ in sign, there exists a continuum of bilateral tariff policies that ensure balanced  trade and that satisfy the contractual financial obligations. If the new terms-of-trade do not reverse the initial direction of trade, balanced trade is consistent with non-zero exports and imports. In general, high enough bilateral tariffs lead to an autarkic outcome where no trade occurs and the net foreign asset positions rebalance to zero.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the determinants of poor mental health among students at an elite private institution. Survey measures of well-being have declined significantly over the last decade for both high school students and those of college age. This is an international phenomenon that appears to have started in the US around 2013 and that was not caused by but was exacerbated by COVID and the associated lockdowns. We focus on elite and non-elite institutions and examine Dartmouth as a special case. Dartmouth ranks well compared to other institutions. However, around a quarter of Dartmouth students (26%) report they suffer from moderate to severe depression and 22% that they suffer from moderate, to severe, anxiety and 10% say they contemplated suicide. Student’s wellbeing appears to be impacted negatively by stress over finances. We find broad patterns in the data, that ill-being is higher among females, those who engage in little exercise, have low GPAs, are not athletes nor in academic clubs nor religious organizations, reside in fraternity housing or are on financial aid.</content>

    <title>Why Do Union Jobs Pay More? New Evidence from Matched Employer-Employee Data</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use Canadian matched employer-employee data to assess the sources of the union pay premium. After controlling for worker heterogeneity using the Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999) (AKM) two-way fixed effects approach, we find that unionized firms pay about 15 log points more than non-unionized firms. Forty percent of this gap is linked to productivity differences between unionized and non-unionized firms as measured by value added per worker. The remaining gap reflects unions’ ability to extract more rents for workers. Our estimates imply that unions raise pay among unionized workers by around 9 log points. The union effect grows to about 11 log points in an extension of the AKM approach where unions also affect the returns to unobservable worker characteristics.</content>

    <title>Tariffs and Retaliation: A Brief Macroeconomic Analysis</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We quantify the macroeconomic effects of the tariff measures announced (but not entirely implemented yet) on Liberation Day (April 2nd, 2025) through the lens of a New-Keynesian two-country model calibrated to the US and the rest of the world. We study both a unilateral 10pp tariff increase and a global trade war scenario with retalia- tory tariffs of a similar magnitude. In either case, tariffs are always sharply contractionary for US GDP, increasing inflation and widening the trade deficit. Measured in welfare terms a unilateral tariff generates gains for the US due to a large terms of trade appreciation, but these US welfare gains vanish with global retaliation. Three features of the model are critical in the evaluation of the tariff impact - the asymmetry in size and openness between the US and the rest of the world, the endogenous response of monetary policy to the inflationary effects of tariffs, and the importance of trade in intermediate goods for the scale of the global response to a tariff shock.</content>

    <title>Money or Time? Heterogeneous Effects of Unconditional Cash on Parental Investments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Household time and money allocations in response to income support programs vary across diverse family circumstances and preferences, yet such heterogeneous responses are not well understood. Using data from a large-scale, multisite, U.S.-based randomized controlled study, we examine heterogeneity in the effects of a monthly unconditional cash transfer on monetary and time investments in children. This study offers a novel opportunity to examine heterogeneous effects of a cash transfer by race and ethnicity, where receipt is independent of eligibility based on other demographic characteristics. The effects of the cash transfer on net household income, earnings, and household expenditures were similar for families irrespective of race or ethnicity, even given initial differences in family structure, government benefit receipt, and employment. However, effects on monetary and time investments in children differed. Latino families’ child-focused expenditures increased, equivalent to nearly one-third of the cash transfer, with no effect on maternal employment or time spent with children. Among Black families, maternal work hours decreased and time spent with children on early learning activities increased, with no effect on child-focused expenditures. Marginal propensities to consume child-specific goods from different income sources also varied: Estimates showed a higher marginal propensity to consume child-specific goods from government income than from maternal income among Latino families, and the opposite among Black families. Latino families’ responses to the unconditional cash transfer and to government income are consistent with the notion that signals regarding intended use of income influence spending decisions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how preventive medical care use affects health behaviors and outcomes for patients with chronic diseases. Leveraging variation induced by a national appointment reminder program, rolled out across 315 public primary care clinics in Chile, we use an instrumental variables approach with patient-level administrative data from over 300,000 patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. We find that increased preventive visits lead to more screening tests and large increases in medication adherence. Preventive care also leads to earlier detection and treatment of cardiovascular complications: we document an increase in cardiovascular hospitalizations but a reduction in in-hospital mortality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The OECD has promoted the adoption of internationally standardized transfer pricing rules to curb profit shifting for tax avoidance by multinational firms. Bustos et al. (2023) analyzed a large reform in Chile based on these OECD standards and found that it led to a surge in tax advisory services. This paper investigates the external validity of this finding. Combining employment history data with information on countries’ strictness of transfer pricing regulations over time, we analyze the effect for four countries: Chile, Colombia, Spain, and Uruguay. Event-study difference-in-differences analysis shows that reforms led to substantial increase in transfer pricing consultants in most cases. The effect is larger when the reform is stronger and when a country has a lower level of pre-treatment transfer pricing strictness or of transfer pricing consultants.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study disparities in liver transplant allocation when innovation alleviates the scarcity of organs. When direct-acting antivirals for Hepatitis C (HCV) reduced HCV+ liver demand, we show a disproportionate increase in White HCV- liver transplants (56.6%) relative to Black HCV- transplants (11.9%). The time to transplant decreased (31.1%), and the transplant rate increased (19.5pp), only for White HCV- patients. Our results are surprising because liver health is the primary determinant of transplant priority and marginal White patients were of better liver health. We show more similar gains when we focus on privately insured patients and/or areas with more Black patients.</content>

    <title>Analyzing the Effects of Occupational Licensing on Earnings Inequality in the United States</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is a consensus that there is an earnings premium for licensed workers relative to unlicensed workers. However, little is known about how occupational licensing affects earnings inequality. In this paper, we study dynamic, heterogeneous earnings effects of occupational licensing and draw implications for earnings inequality in the United States. First, we find that the earnings gap between workers in licensed occupations and those in unlicensed occupations with similar characteristics (“licensing premium”) increased slightly during the 1983–2019 period. Second, we find that the licensing premium for workers in high paying occupations significantly increased, which is not the case for workers in lower paying occupations. The finding is consistent with growing demands for skills over the past decades, given the more rigorous licensing requirements for high-skilled occupations. As a result, earnings inequality among workers in licensed occupations increased. Third, we document that the licensing premium for female workers and workers without a college education declined relative to male workers and college graduates. Taken together, our findings suggest that occupational licensing is associated with widening earnings inequality in the United States during the 1983–2019 period.</content>

    <title>The Gender Gap in Career Trajectories: Do Firms Matter?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The gender wage gap rises with experience. To what extent do firm policies mediate this rise? We use administrative data from Italy to identify workers' first jobs and compute wage growth over the next 5 years. We then decompose the contribution of first employers to the rise in the gender wage gap, taking account of maternity events affecting a third of female entrants. We find that idiosyncratic firm effects explain 20% of the variation in early career wage growth, and that the sorting of women to slower-growth firms accounts for a fifth of the gender growth gap. Women who have a child within 5 years of entering work have particularly slow wage growth, reflecting a maternity effect that is magnified by the excess sorting of mothers-to-be to slower-growth firms. Many entrants change jobs within their first 5 years, and we find that the male-female difference in early career wage growth arises from gaps for both movers and stayers. The first employer components in wage growth for stayers and movers are highly correlated, and contribute similar sorting penalties for women who stay or leave.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines publications in three leading general economics journals from the 1960s through the 2020s, considering levels and trends in the demographics of authors, methodologies of the studies, and patterns of co-authorship. The average age of authors has increased nearly steadily; there has been a sharp increase in the fraction of female authors; the number of authors per paper has risen steadily; and there has been a pronounced shift to articles using newly generated data. All but the first of these trends have been most pronounced in the most recent decade. The study also examines the relationships among these trends.</content>

    <title>A Stepping Stone Approach to Norm Transitions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a model to study when an intermediate action can serve as a “stepping stone” that enables the elimination of a harmful norm. While the intermediate action may facilitate the first “step”, it may also become a new norm. We derive intuitive conditions for stepping stones, which depend on the relative size of social penalties and intrinsic utility benefits. We propose an econometric approach to testing whether an intermediate action is a stepping stone, and apply it to original data on female genital cutting in Somalia. The analysis shows that the intermediate action may become the new norm.</content>

    <title>Saved by Medicaid: New Evidence on Health Insurance and Mortality from the Universe of Low-Income Adults</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the causal effect of health insurance on mortality using the universe of low-income adults, a dataset of 37 million individuals identified by linking the 2010 Census to administrative tax data. Our methodology leverages state-level variation in the timing and adoption of Medicaid expansions under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and earlier waivers and adheres to a preregistered analysis plan, a rarely used approach in observational studies in economics. We find that expansions increased Medicaid enrollment by 12 percentage points and reduced the mortality of the low-income adult population by 2.5 percent, suggesting a 21 percent reduction in the mortality hazard of new enrollees. Mortality reductions accrued not only to older age cohorts, but also to younger adults, who accounted for nearly half of life-years saved due to their longer remaining lifespans and large share of the low-income adult population. These expansions appear to be cost-effective, with direct budgetary costs of $5.4 million per life saved and $179,000 per life-year saved falling well below valuations commonly found in the literature. Our findings suggest that lack of health insurance explains about five to twenty percent of the mortality disparity between high- and low-income Americans. We contribute to a growing body of evidence that health insurance improves health and demonstrate that Medicaid’s life-saving effects extend across a broader swath of the low-income population than previously understood.</content>

    <title>Trends in Work Capacity in the US Population: Are Recent Cohorts in Worse Health?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The growth of longevity in the U.S. and other countries has increased interest in raising the age of eligibility for public retirement benefits. The consequences of this policy depend on the health of the older adult population overall and by socioeconomic group. In this paper, we estimate how multiple dimensions of non-fatal health in older adults evolve over time and across cohorts – physical functioning, mental health, pain, and cognition. Our sample is individuals in the Health and Retirement Study who are aged 51 to 54 at baseline and are followed for up to two decades. We find that limitations in most domains have increased for younger cohorts, especially pain and cognitive impairment. People are more impaired in their 50s, where such impairment used to occur in one’s 60s. However, this appears to be a speeding up of impairment more than a long-term increase. Among people in their late 60s, health for later cohorts is similar to health for earlier cohorts. To evaluate the implications of these trends, we simulate the work capacity of adults just before reaching age 65 based on the health status of people at this age and the relationship between health and the labor force outcomes of younger people. Overall health among those age 62 to 64 remains high, despite impairment striking at younger ages. However, among people without high school degrees, less than half are predicted to have the capacity to work full time by age 62 to 64, and over a quarter are predicted to be receiving SSDI.</content>
