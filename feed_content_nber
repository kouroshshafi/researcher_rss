    <title>The Economics of Healthcare Fraud</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Healthcare fraud imposes a sizable cost on U.S. public healthcare budgets and distorts health care provision. We examine the economics of health care fraud and enforcement using theory and data and connect to a growing literature on the topic. We first offer a new economic definition of health care fraud that captures and connects the wide range of activities prosecuted as fraud. We define fraud as any divergence between the care an insurer says a patient qualifies for, the care a provider provides, and the care a provider bills for. Our definition clarifies the economic consequences of different categories of fraud and provides a framework for understanding the slate of existing studies. Next, we examine the incentives for committing and for prosecuting fraud. We show how fraud is driven by a combination of inadequate (expected) penalties for fraud and imperfect reimbursement rates. Public anti-fraud litigation is driven by the relative monetary, political or career returns to prosecuting fraud and by prosecutorial budgets. Finally, we examine the prevalence of health care fraud prosecutions across types of fraud and types of care, and across the US, by machine learning on text data from Department of Justice press releases.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The prospect for electric vehicles (EVs) as a climate change solution hinges on their widespread adoption across political lines. This paper uses county-level data to show that from 2012-2023, about half of all new EV registrations in the U.S. went to the 10% most Democratic counties. This correlation remains largely stable over time, though EV trucks show a lower correlation than other EV types. We also conducted a survey, finding no difference in the ability of Democrats and Republicans to identify EVs. Overall, our results suggest that barriers to widespread U.S. EV adoption may be greater than anticipated.</content>

    <title>Shadow Always Touches the Feet: Implications of Bank Credit Lines to Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using real estate investment trusts (REITs) that invest in commercial real estate (CRE) as a leading example, we study the implications for banks of extending credit lines to “shadow banks” or non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs). While small and mid-size banks hold an economically significant direct exposure in CRE term loans, a significant part of the CRE exposure of large banks is indirect via credit-line provision to REITs. Utilization of credit lines by REITs tends to be substantially more sensitive to market stress than non-financial corporates and other NBFIs. In turn, large banks suffer drawdowns and equity corrections in stress times from extending credit lines to REITs. Ignoring this NBFI credit line channel understates the exposure of large banks to stress. We propose a methodology to incorporate this exposure and its heterogeneity in bank capital stress tests.</content>

    <title>Correcting Endogeneity via Instrument-Free Two-Stage Nonparametric Copula Control Functions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Given the ubiquitous presence of endogenous regressors and the challenges in finding good instruments to overcome the endogeneity problem, a forefront of recent research is the development and application of endogeneity correction methods without requiring instruments. In this article,  we formulate the regressor endogeneity problem using a novel conditional copula endogeneity model to capture the regressor-error dependence unexplained by exogenous regressors. The model relaxes the key assumption of Gaussian copula regressor-error dependence structure and eliminates unnecessary modeling of  regressors.  Under the model, we develop an instrument-free two-stage nonparametric copula endogeneity control function approach (2sCOPE-np), which generalizes existing copula endogeneity correction methods and minimizes the assumptions in the first-stage auxiliary model for endogenous regressors. Specifically, the 2sCOPE-np employs robust model-free kernel estimates of copula control functions. We elucidate and demonstrate the  robustness and broad applicability of 2sCOPE-np, compared to existing copula endogeneity correction methods.  Simulation studies further demonstrate that 2sCOPE-np outperforms existing methods. We illustrate the usage of 2sCOPE-np in an empirical application of the store sales demand estimation.</content>

    <title>A Bid Strategy for Earlier Payment: Evidence and Implications of Front-End Loading in Procurement</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Liquidity management is key in industries with variable cash flows. We study how businesses in the highway construction industry manage cash flow by strategically bidding more on work with an earlier payout—a practice known as front-end loading. We find that small contractors, infrequent bidders, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises front-end load more intensely, indicating a stronger preference for earlier payment. An equilibrium bidding model highlights a novel pathway through which this preference can affect procurement and its managerial and policy implications.</content>

    <title>Defensive Hiring and Creative Destruction</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Defensive hiring of researchers by incumbent firms with monopsony power reduces creative destruction. This mechanism helps explain the simultaneous rise in R&amp;D spending and decline in TFP growth in the US economy over recent decades. We develop a simple model highlighting the critical role of the inelastic supply of research labor in enabling this effect. Empirical evidence confirms that the research labor supply in the US is indeed inelastic and supports other model predictions: incumbent R&amp;D spending is negatively correlated with creative destruction and sectoral TFP growth while extending incumbents' lifespan. All these effects are amplified when ideas are harder to find. An extended version of the model quantifies these mechanisms' implications for productivity, innovation, and policy.</content>

    <title>Liquidity Crises and the Market-Maker of Last Resort</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study market illiquidity in an economy subject to non-fundamental shocks. Asset trading occurs via decentralized one-on-one bargaining. The model has multiple rational expectations equilibria; we associate certain Pareto inferior equilibria with liquidity crises. The government can improve welfare by acting as a “market-maker of last resort” (MMLR), purchasing assets at above-market prices. Several policies employed by the US during the financial crisis are examples of MMLR. We consider “aggressive” and “conservative” MMLR policies. The aggressive policy supports the unique pareto optimal equilibrium. The conservative policy, which embeds a “no-bailout constraint,” only supports an inefficient equilibrium.</content>

    <title>The Value of Worker Rights in Collective Bargaining</title>
    <updated>2025-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Benjamin W. Arold, Elliott Ash, W. Bentley MacLeod &amp; Suresh Naidu</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes novel natural language methods to measure worker rights from collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) for use in empirical economic analysis. Applying unsupervised text-as-data algorithms to a new collection of 30,000 CBAs from Canada in the period 1986-2015, we parse legal obligations (e.g., “the employer shall provide...”) and legal rights (e.g., “workers shall receive...”) from the contract text. We validate that contract clauses provide worker rights, which include both amenities and control over the work environment. Companies that provide more worker rights score highly on a survey indicating pro-worker management practices. Using time-varying province-level variation in labor income tax rates, we find that higher taxes increase the share of worker-rights clauses while reducing pre-tax wages in unionized firms, consistent with a substitution effect away from taxed compensation (wages) toward untaxed amenities (worker rights). Further, an exogenous increase in the value of outside options (from a leave-one-out instrument for labor demand) increases the share of worker rights clauses in CBAs. Combining the regression estimates, we infer that a one-standard-deviation increase in worker rights is valued at about 5.7% of wages.</content>

    <title>Can Treasury Markets Add and Subtract?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Treasury markets respond to the news in CBO cost estimates of individual bills about the future funding requirements from pending legislation. Treasury yields increase on days with major deficit-increasing bills, driven by an increase in expected inflation and nominal term premia, along with a decrease in convenience yields. The effects are three times larger for cost revisions for emergency spending proposals, which are unfunded and have a high probability of enactment. Our high-frequency estimates imply that a 1 percentage point one-time increase in deficits/GDP increases the 10-year nominal yield by 0.75 bps. This effect is equivalent to a 6.75 bps increase in yields for a persistent shock to deficits. Investors use these cost releases to learn about the U.S. fiscal stance. In a model with learning, we find that investors attributed a significant portion of the deficit news from cost releases to revisions in policy parameters and that 57% of the total deficit impact was expected to be unbacked.</content>

    <title>Uprootedness, Human Capital, and Skill Transferability</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;More than a century has passed since the abrupt exodus of 1.2 million Greek Orthodox from Anatolia and their resettlement in Greece, a transformative event for the country’s social and demographic landscape. Today, more than one in three Greeks reports a refugee background. While its historical significance is well-documented, its short-, medium-, and long-term impact on human capital accumulation remains unexplored. How did forced displacement shape the educational trajectories of the uprooted and their offspring? Did refugees invest in portable skills to respond to uncertainty, or did they struggle to catch up with the autochthonous? To address these questions, we trace the educational investments of refugees and their descendants over the last 100 years, leveraging granular census data and a comprehensive mapping of both their origins in Anatolia and their settlements in Greece. The analysis provides compelling support for the uprootedness hypothesis. Though initially lagging, refugees settling in the Greek countryside eventually outperformed nearby natives in educational attainment. Their university choices also diverged, with refugees’ lineages favoring degrees transferable beyond the Greek labor market, such as engineering and medicine, and natives specializing in law and other fields with a strong home bias. Exploring additional mechanisms reveals the critical role of linguistic barriers and local economic conditions in shaping these outcomes, rather than the refugees’ pre-migration economic background. The widespread educational gains of refugees and their descendants over four generations offer some hope that the ongoing surge of forced displacement, despite its tragedy, if properly addressed by the international community, can be a backbone of economic resilience for the affected communities.</content>

    <title>Growth and Fluctuations Economies with Land Speculation</title>
    <updated>2025-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Tomohiro Hirano &amp; Joseph E. Stiglitz</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper considers growth and fluctuations in a standard Overlapping Generations (OLG) model with rational expectations, with land (a non-produced asset), credit frictions, and endogenous growth. Under plausible conditions, there can be multiple momentary equilibria, with the multiplicity itself depending on capital and land prices; this can give rise in turn to an infinity of rational expectations trajectories, all operating within bounds that can be calculated. Improvements in technology, while in the short run increasing GDP, may result in the equilibrium being unstable and fragile—and in the long run lead to a stagnation trap with lower GDP. The introduction of land increases the scope for fluctuations; the only rational expectations trajectories may entail fluctuations, with episodic unemployment and dynamic inefficiencies. With credit frictions, expansionary credit and financial policies may lead to lower growth, with the additional funds unevenly going to land speculation, diverting savings from productive investments, results consistent with empirical evidence. The analysis resolves several theoretical puzzles, such as how can land prices be finite with an interest rate less than the growth rate. It shows that even with two state variables, a tractable OLG model can be constructed providing a global analysis of complex dynamics.</content>

    <title>The Evolution of Inflation Targeting from the 1990s to the 2020s: Developments and Challenges</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Since the initial launch of inflation targeting in the early 1990s in New Zealand and a few other countries, inflation targeting has become the predominant monetary policy strategy in large advanced and emerging market economies. Inflation targeting has been remarkably successful in anchoring inflation, likely owing to core elements of the framework across central banks. Its reaction process, which adjusts the monetary policy stance to ensure the return of inflation to target, allows it to flexibly incorporate a wide range of factors while limiting the discretionary biases that can contribute to excessive inflation. The emphasis on communications about the inflation outlook promotes transparency and accountability. As a result, inflation targeting central banks have, on balance, managed well the large shocks associated with the Global Financial Crisis and COVID. Even so, there are numerous challenges discussed in this paper that are associated with calibration and communications of forward guidance, quantitative easing/tightening, and financial stability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;School districts increasingly gauge school quality with surveys that ask about school climate and student engagement. We use data from New York City’s middle and high schools to compare the long-run predictive validity of surveys with that of conventional test score value-added models (VAMs). Our analysis leverages the New York school match, which includes an element of random assignment, to validate a wide range of school quality estimates. We contrast the predictiveness of survey- and test-based measures for school effects on consequential outcomes related to high school graduation and college enrollment. Survey data generate better predictions of school impacts on high school graduation than test scores. But school effects on advanced high school diplomas and college attainment are better predicted by test score VAMs than surveys. We quantify the practical value of test-based and survey-based school quality measures by simulating the effects of access to one or both types of information for parents. Parents interested in boosting their children’s college attainment benefit more from test score value-added than from survey data.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter examines the role of spatial sorting in shaping economic inequality in the United States. We first document the evolution of firm and worker sorting by skill level between 1980 and 2017. We highlight a shift since 2000, where both high-education workers and firms increasingly sort away from high-wage, high-rent areas. Throughout the entire time period, high-education workers continue to sort to high amenity areas. We then develop a spatial equilibrium model that incorporates idiosyncratic worker and firm sorting and discuss estimation techniques to identify model parameters. We review recent empirical advancements in spatial sorting, including firm and worker location choices and their interactions with housing policy. We conclude by outlining the model’s limitations and proposing directions for future research.</content>

    <title>A Geospatial Approach to Measuring Economic Activity</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a new methodology to detect and measure economic activity using geospatial data and apply it to steel production, a major industrial pollution source worldwide. Combining plant output data with geospatial data, such as ambient air pollutants, nighttime lights, and temperature, we train machine learning models to predict plant locations and output. We identify about 40% (70%) of plants missing from the training sample within a 1 km (5 km) radius and achieve R² above 0.8 for output prediction at a 1 km grid and at the plant level, as well as for both regional and time series validations. Our approach can be adapted to other industries and regions, and used by policymakers and researchers to track and measure industrial activity in near real time.</content>

    <title>The Macroeconomic Dynamics of Labor Market Policies</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a dynamic macroeconomic framework with worker heterogeneity, putty-clay adjustment frictions, and firm monopsony power to study the distributional impact of labor market policies over time. Our framework reconciles the well-known tension between low short-run and high long-run elasticities of substitution across inputs of production, especially among workers with different skills within a same education group. We use this framework to evaluate the effects of redistributive policies such as the minimum wage and the Earned Income Tax Credit. We argue that since these policies generate slow transition dynamics that can differ greatly in the short and long run, a serious assessment of their overall impact must take account of the entire time path of the responses they induce.</content>

    <title>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Measurement of Telework During and Shortly After the Pandemic—an On-the-Ground Perspective</title>
    <updated>2025-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020, the amount of telework sharply increased, allowing people to work while limiting their exposure to others. At that time, there were no regular monthly economic indicators measuring the prevalence of telework. Thus, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) supplemented its monthly economic indicators to better measure the effect of the pandemic on the labor market, adding a short set of questions to the Current Population Survey (CPS) in May 2020. This set focused on the immediate labor market response to COVID-19, including one question about whether people were teleworking because of the pandemic. These questions became less relevant over time and were replaced in October 2022 by a new set of questions that focused entirely on telework—specifically, telework prior to the onset of the pandemic and current telework practices. The questions about telework prior to the pandemic were discontinued in November 2023, but the questions about current telework were permanently retained.  This paper describes the development, evaluation, collection, analysis, and publication of the two sets of questions. We then compare the results of the telework metrics in the two sets, demonstrating how, although related, they measure fundamentally different concepts.</content>

    <title>Sources of Generational Persistence in the Effects of Early-Life Health Interventions</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that the long-run economic benefits of a low-cost early-life health intervention transmit to later generations, but only for children of exposed mothers. We provide novel evidence that the program improved mothers' marriage outcomes but had limited effects on fathers' partnering decisions. Changes in assortative mating patterns may, therefore, be an important mechanism behind program-induced intergenerational spillovers. We also show that the intervention significantly increased economic mobility across three generations, suggesting that early health interventions may be important candidates for reducing the cycle of poverty.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Impact investors claim to distinguish themselves from traditional venture capital and growth equity investors by also pursuing ESG objectives. Whether they successfully do so in practice is unclear. We use confidential Census Bureau microdata to assess worker outcomes across portfolio companies. Consistent with earlier studies, impact investors are more likely than other private equity firms to fund businesses in economically disadvantaged areas, and the performance of these companies lags behind those held by traditional private investors. We show that postfunding impact-backed firms are more likely to hire minorities, unskilled workers, and individuals with lower historical earnings, perhaps reflecting the higher representation of minorities in top positions. They also allocate wage increases more favorably to minorities and rank-and-file workers than VC-backed firms. Our results are consistent with impact investors and their portfolio companies acting according to non-pecuniary social goals.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter is intended as an introduction to laboratory experiments, when to use, how to evaluate them, why they matter and what are the pitfalls when designing them. I hope that users as well as consumers will find Sections that broaden their views. I start with when an economist might want to run an experiment. I then discuss basic lessons when designing experiments. I introduce a language to start a systematic description of tools we have when designing experiments to show the importance or role of a new model or force in explaining behavior. The penultimate chapter provides an advanced toolkit for running experiments. I end this chapter with my views on pre-registration, pre-analysis plans and the need for replications, robustness tests and extensions.</content>

    <title>The Role of Risk and Ambiguity Preferences on Early-Childhood Investment: Evidence from Rural India</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Understanding the role of preferences, beliefs, and constraints on social and wealth inequities is a key unlock for economic growth. This study focuses on the inter-relationship between risk and ambiguity preferences of mothers, their early childhood investments, and their children’s outcomes. To do so, we elicit ambiguity attitude and risk aversion preference parameters from more than 6000 randomly sampled mothers from nearly 500 villages in Rajasthan, India. Across several measures of mothers’ investment in nutrition of their children between the ages of 0-6, we find a robust and stable positive correlation of estimated ambiguity attitude and risk aversion parameters with maternal investments: the more risk and ambiguity averse the mother, the greater her investments. Such investments are correlated with better children’s cognitive and non-cognitive skills, as mothers with greater risk and ambiguity aversion have children with superior skills, even after accounting for socio-economic differences. Importantly, the positive effect of ambiguity and risk aversion on early-life outcomes can attenuate the negative impact of proxies of socio-economic disadvantage, such as illiteracy of the mothers, belonging to historically discriminated social groups, no exposure to radio, television, or zero access to mobile phones for all measures of cognitive and non-cognitive early-life skills.</content>

    <title>The Inverted U-Shaped Relationship between Female Entrepreneurship and Economic Development</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the World Bank Enterprise Survey, the share of entrepreneurs who are women first rises and then falls with national income, which reverses the well-known U-shaped relationship between female labor force participation and economic development.  This paper presents a model of entrepreneurship in which women face disadvantages, including discrimination from workers and household demands on their time, that deter firm formation in the poorest countries. In richer countries, these forces mean that women are less likely to start more complex organizations.  In the model, women face the most level playing field in middle-income countries, where the returns to entrepreneurship are high enough to offset gender-based costs and both sexes typically form simple forms.  We document three facts that are compatible with the model: male-owned firms are typically much larger than female-owned firms, large firms yield far higher revenues per employee and female-owned firms are more usually in industries with low levels of skilled workers. Despite the entrepreneurship rate’s reversal of the U-shaped link between female labor-force-participation and economic development, female labor-force-participation and the entrepreneurship rate are highly correlated across countries.  The female entrepreneurship rate is also strongly associated with female education, weak kinship ties and Buddhism.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Flood protection infrastructure investments, such as Army Corps of Engineers levees, can enhance resilience to flood risks amplified by climate change. We estimate levees’ benefits by exploiting repeat residential property transactions. In areas protected by levees, home values increase 3-4 percent. Levees impose adverse spillover flood risks that reduce home values in nearby areas by 1-5 percent. Capitalized benefits in protected areas are progressive, but adverse spillover impacts are regressive. Capitalized benefits at levee construction do not vary by race, but racial sorting occurs post-construction. The local political economy of levee construction can explain the distribution of winners and losers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The child mental health crisis has been described as the “defining public health crisis of our time.” This article addresses three myths about the crisis: (i) the idea that the crisis is new; (ii) the belief that increases in youth suicide mainly reflect deterioration in children’s underlying mental health; and (iii) the myth that investments in children have little impact on children’s mental health. In fact, the cri- sis has existed for decades, youth suicides vary asynchronously with other mental health measures and are impacted by external factors such as firearms legislation, and investments can improve child mental health and prevent suicide.</content>

    <title>The Impact of Increased Exposure of Diversity on Suburban Students' Outcomes: An Analysis of the METCO Voluntary Desegregation Program</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over sixty years following Brown vs. Board of Education, racial and socioeconomic segregation and lack of equal access to educational opportunities persist. Across the country, voluntary desegregation busing programs aim to ameliorate these imbalances and disparities. A longstanding Massachusetts program, METCO, buses K-12 students of color from Boston and Springfield, Massachusetts to 37 suburban districts that voluntarily enroll urban students. Supporters of the program argue that it prepares students to be active citizens in our multicultural society. Opponents question the value of the program and worry it may have a negative impact on suburban student outcomes. I estimate the causal effect of exposure to diversity through the METCO program by using two types of variation: difference-in-difference analysis of schools stopping and starting their METCO enrollment and two-stage least squares analysis of space availability for METCO students. Both methods rule out substantial test score, attendance, or suspension effects of having METCO peers. Classroom ability distribution and classroom suspension rates remain similar when METCO programs start and stop. There is no negative impact on college preparation, competitiveness, persistence, or graduation.</content>

    <title>Subscriptions to Prescriptions: Lessons from Louisiana’s Effort to Eliminate Hepatitis C</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Hepatitis C is a major public health concern due to its high rates of infection and mortality. Recent breakthroughs in pharmaceuticals not only have the potential to cure hepatitis C but could also cause large positive health externalities through reduced transmission. The high cost of these drugs under traditional reimbursement schemes create large obstacles to care, but a recent first-of-its-kind two-part tariff system in Louisiana aims to circumvent these obstacles using a modified subscription model with an exclusive pharmaceutical provider. Under this model, the medication is provided at no marginal cost to the state to cover the state's Medicaid and incarcerated population. This creates an incentive for Louisiana to aggressively test and treat as many patients as possible in order to maximize the benefits of this agreement. Using a number of different data sources, we implement synthetic control and event-study specifications, and find that detection and treatment of hepatitis C increased dramatically, with meaningful reductions in hepatitis C-related mortality and liver transplants after this agreement. Finally, after calculating the Marginal Value of Public Funds of this agreement, we find that the program more than pays for itself.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How should governments structure primary sovereign bond markets when investors face asymmetric uncertainty about default risk and total demand? Standard protocols either use uniform prices for all investors, or price discriminate based on bid prices (“pay as bid”). Uniform pricing encourages more bidding by uninformed investors but price discrimination captures inframarginal surplus. Based on this tradeoff, we analyze a potential protocol that features price discrimination on inframarginal bids and uniform pricing on marginal bids, thereby reducing the mean and variance of public borrowing costs. We also offer new evidence on the information content of primary bond markets which supports our framework.</content>

    <title>The Rise and Fall (and Rise) of the Affordable Care Act: Varying Impacts on Coverage Over Time and Place</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Affordable Care Act (ACA) significantly expanded health insurance in the United States, but its impact has varied across time and states. We assess the law’s heterogeneous impacts over the three presidential administrations since its enactment, as well as across states with different levels of implementation of the law. We focus on Medicaid expansion and Marketplace subsidies, including the enhanced subsidies under the American Rescue Plan of 2021 (ARP). We use national household survey data and a triple-difference design – leveraging variation by time, state, and income – to identify the coverage impacts of the key components of the law. We find that 55% of ACA-related coverage gains between 2013 and 2023 came from Marketplace subsidies – about 37% from the original ACA subsidies and 19% from the ARP enhancements – while 45% were due to Medicaid, including from the "welcome mat" effect. Coverage gains differed substantially across presidential administrations, with Marketplace subsidies proving roughly 30% more effective under Presidents Obama and Biden than under President Trump. The same subsidy amount was more than twice as effective in states with their own Marketplaces than in states relying on the federal Marketplace. Our findings highlight that while the ACA’s explicit economic features drive coverage gains, their effectiveness can be substantially enhanced or hindered through federal and state implementation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When estimating the effects of treatments defined by complex formulas, researchers often use simple functions of exogenous shocks as instruments. A leading example is “simulated instruments” for public policy eligibility, which capture variation in state-level policy generosity. We show how more powerful instruments can be constructed by incorporating heterogeneous shock exposure while using a recentering procedure to avoid bias. We characterize the asymptotically efficient instruments in this class and propose an algorithm for constructing feasible approximations to them. Compared to a simulated instrument approach, our approach yields a 44% smaller standard error on the private insurance crowd-out effect of Medicaid enrollment from the 2014 Affordable Care Act expansions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The motherhood penalty is well-documented, but what happens at the other end of the reproductive spectrum? Menopause—a transition often marked by debilitating physical and psychological symptoms—also entails substantial costs. Using population-wide Norwegian and Swedish data and quasi-experimental methods, we show that a menopause diagnosis leads to lasting drops in earnings and employment, alongside greater reliance on social transfers. The impact is especially severe for women with lower socioeconomic status. Increasing access to menopause-related health care can help offset these losses. Our findings reveal the hidden economic toll of menopause and the potential gains from better support policies.</content>

    <title>Choosing Wisely: Evaluating Latent Factor Models in the Presence of a Contaminated Instrumental Variable with Varying Strength</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Causal inference methods are widely used in empirical research; however, there is a paucity of evidence on the properties of shared latent factor estimators in the presence of contaminated instrumental variable (IV) when a strong IV may not be available. We present a theoretical formulation to depict how the strength and degree of contamination of the IV simultaneously determine the optimal choice of estimator. We perform Monte Carlo simulations with four outcome variables and an endogenous treatment variable, with sample sizes of 1000 and 2000, and for 1000 iterations, to compare the finite sample properties of the OLS, 2SLS, Shared Latent Factor without IV (SLF), and Shared Latent Factor with IV (SLF+IV) estimators. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed estimators to study the causal impact of maternal parity on various maternal and child health indicators: child’s height-for-age percentile, child’s weight-for-age percentile, child’s haemoglobin count, and mother’s haemoglobin count, using data from the 2019-21 Round 5 of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) from India. Our simulation results indicate that for a given degree of contamination of the IV, there exists a threshold strength of the IV, such that the SLF+IV estimator has a lower (greater) bias than the SLF estimator when the strength of the IV lies above (below) that threshold. The empirical results suggest that a lower parity is associated with higher height-for-age and weight-for-age percentile and haemoglobin count in children and a higher haemoglobin count in mothers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Beginning in January 2021, over less than two years, credit card usage by small U.S. businesses nearly doubled, interest payments rose by 60%, and delinquencies reached 2.8%. In this paper, we utilize near real-time QuickBooks data from over 1.6 million small businesses and a targeted survey to highlight the critical role that credit card financing plays in small business activity. We find, first, monthly credit card payments were up to three times higher than loan payments during this time. Second, we use targeted surveys of these small businesses to establish credit cards as a key financing source in response to firm-level shocks, such as uncertain cash flows and overdue invoices. Third, we highlight the critical role of credit cards as a key financial transmission mechanism. Following the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes in early 2022, banks cut credit card supply, leading to a 15.75% drop in balances and a 10% decline in revenue growth, as well as a 1.5% decrease in employment growth among U.S. small businesses. These higher rates also rendered interest payments unsustainable for many, contributing to half of the observed increase in delinquencies. Lastly, a simple heterogeneous firm model with a cash-in-hand constraint illustrates the significant macroeconomic impact of credit card financing on small business activity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The U.S. government has funded university research for nearly 80 years, with a signiﬁcant share of this funding supporting the fixed costs of science through indirect cost recovery (ICR). We explain the history, objectives, and mechanics of ICR policy and review key controversies. We also provide new empirical evidence on indirect costs at the NIH, a major target of past and present ICR reform. Using data from over 350 institutions, we find that while negotiated ICR rates average 58%, effective rates—what NIH actually pays—average 42%, with relatively little variation across institutions or over time. Our analyses also suggest that a proposed 15% ﬂat rate would significantly cut NIH funding for many grantees, disproportionately affecting institutions most linked to commercial patenting and drug development. We conclude by assessing the current system, and major reform proposals, across several ICR policy objectives: support for research and infrastructure, cost-efficiency incentives, implementation costs, and transparency. No single approach dominates on all dimensions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Revolving door laws restrict public officials from representing private interests before government after leaving office. While these laws mitigate potential conflicts of interest, they also may affect the pool of candidates for public positions by lowering the financial benefits of holding office. We study the consequences of revolving door laws for political selection in U.S. state legislatures, exploiting the staggered roll-out of laws across states over time. We find that fewer new candidates enter politics in treated states and that incumbent legislators are less likely to leave office, leading to an increase in uncontested elections. The decline in entry is particularly strong for independent and more moderate candidates, which may increase polarization. We provide a model of politician career incentives to interpret the results.</content>

    <title>Class Disparities and Discrimination in Traffic Stops and Searches</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine class disparities and discrimination in police searches and stops using data on traffic stops conducted by Texas Highway Patrol. Low-income motorists are more likely to be searched for contraband, less likely to be found with contraband when searched, and more likely to be stopped for infractions associated with pretext stops. We measure class-based discrimination in searches per potential stop, accounting for both the search and stop margins. Our research design leverages motorists stopped in multiple vehicles conveying different class signals. Motorists are more likely to be searched when stopped in a low-status vehicle, and evidence suggests that they are also more likely to be stopped when driving one. Marginal searches triggered by vehicle status are also less likely to yield contraband when the motorist is low-income. We argue that lower hassle costs associated with arrests of low-income motorists help explain trooper behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Browser data from an approximately representative sample of individual investors offers a detailed account of their search for information, including how much time they spend on stock research, which stocks they research, what categories of information they seek, and when they gather information relative to events and trades. The median individual investor spends approximately six minutes on research per trade on traded tickers, mostly just before the trade; the mean spends around half an hour. Individual investors spend the most time reviewing price charts, followed by analyst opinions, and exhibit little interest in traditional risk statistics. Aggregate research interest is highly correlated with stock size, and salient news and earnings announcements draw more attention. Individual investors have different research styles, and those that focus on short-term information are more likely to trade more speculative stocks.</content>

    <title>Mechanism Design for Personalized Policy: A Field Experiment Incentivizing Exercise</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Personalizing policies can theoretically increase their effectiveness. However, personalization is difficult when individual types are unobservable and the preferences of policymakers and individuals are not aligned, which could cause individuals to misreport their type. Mechanism design offers a strategy to overcome this issue: offer an “incentive-compatible” menu of policy choices designed to induce participants to select the variant intended for their type. Using a field experiment that personalized incentives for exercise among 6,800 adults with diabetes and hypertension in urban India, we show that personalizing with an incentive-compatible choice menu substantially improves program performance, increasing the treatment effect of incentives on exercise by 80% without increasing program costs relative to a one-size-fits-all benchmark. Mechanism design achieves similar performance to personalizing with an extensive set of observable variables, but without the high data requirements or the risk that participants might manipulate their observables.</content>

    <title>Where Have All the Good Jobs Gone? Changes in the Geography of Work in the US, 1980-2021</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine changes in the spatial distribution of good jobs across US commuting zones over  1980-2000 and 2000-2021. We define good jobs as those in industries in which full-time workers attain high wages, accounting for individual and regional characteristics. The share of good jobs in manufacturing has plummeted; for college graduates,  good jobs have shifted to (mostly tradable) business, professional, and IT services, while for those without a BA they have shifted to (non-tradable) construction. There is strong persistence in where good jobs are located. Over the last four decades, places with larger concentrations of good job industries have tended to hold onto them, consistent with a model of proportional growth. Turning to regional specialization in good job industries, we find evidence of mean reversion. Commuting zones with larger initial concentrations of good jobs have thus seen even faster growth in lower-wage (and mostly non-tradable) services. Changing regional employment patterns are most pronounced among racial minorities and the foreign-born, who are relatively concentrated in fast growing cities of the South and West. Therefore, good job regions today look vastly different than in 1980: they are more centered around human-capital-intensive tradable services, are surrounded by larger concentrations of low-wage, non-tradable industries, and are more demographically diverse.</content>

    <title>Hotelling Meets Keynes: Aggregate Adjustment with Spatial Competition and Nominal Rigidity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper embeds a circular Hotelling model of spatial competition into a new-Keynesian model with staggered price setting. The resulting framework provides microfoundations for a cost-push shock, taking the form of random variations in transportation costs. An increase in transportation costs raises price markups and is contractionary and inflationary. Spatial frictions also have consequences for the propagation of aggregate demand disturbances (including monetary shocks), as they dampen their output effects and amplify their inflationary effects. Empirically, the paper shows that the cost of time spent shopping represents a significant fraction of consumption expenditure, suggesting that spatial frictions broadly defined are a nonnegligible feature of aggregate demand.</content>

    <title>Taxes on Lifetime Income: A Good Idea?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Household consumption and welfare are more strongly associated with lifetime income, but most countries base income taxes on current income and use progressive taxes to reduce inequality and provide social insurance. Is lifetime income a better tax base for a government seeking to provide social insurance and redistribution? To answer this question, we build a quantitative life-cycle model of heterogeneous households with endogenous labor supply and idiosyncratic wage risks, and calibrate it to the U.S. economy. We document that switching to a lifetime income tax leads to a more efficient distribution of hours worked over time and across states of the world. This benefit rises with tax progressivity under a lifetime income tax, whereas the opposite is true under an annual income tax. Consequently, the optimal lifetime income tax is more progressive and achieves larger ex-ante welfare for a cohort of households than the optimal annual income tax.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore the role of memory for choice behavior in unfamiliar environments. Using a unique data set, we document that  decision makers exhibit a "memory premium." They tend to choose in-memory alternatives over out-of-memory ones, even when the latter are objectively better. Consistent with well-established regularities regarding the inner workings of human memory, the memory premium is associative, subject to interference and repetition effects, and decays over time. Even as decision makers gain familiarity with the environment, the memory premium remains economically large. Our results imply that the ease with which past experiences come to mind plays an important role in shaping choice behavior.</content>

    <title>Moral Hazard under Liquidity Constraints</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Spending induced by health insurance is often called moral hazard and definitionally assumed to be inefficient. We adapt standard models and show that for those living "hand-to-mouth", the financing benefits of insurance cause a portion of moral hazard to be efficient. Although insurance's price distortions also create some inefficient spending, the net welfare impacts of moral hazard can be positive. We present an intuitive graphical framework and formal results to distinguish moral hazard’s efficient and inefficient components. Simulations show economically significant net benefits of moral hazard in many cases. Our framework also provides a new way of modeling the "income effect'" induced by  insurance, and distinguishes it from the "liquidity effect". While both can lead to efficient moral hazard, moral-hazard benefits from the "liquidity effect" are often substantially larger. We use our framework to revisit prior estimates of Medicaid’s value from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment. For individuals with minimal liquidity, Medicaid's value is more than twice prior estimates.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The slow adoption of climate change policies stems from concerns about their economic impact. The EU has led global carbon pricing through its Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). This study examines the effect of ETS policy shocks on global stock market returns at the country-industry level using linear and spatial autoregression models. Results show that while markets react negatively to rising carbon prices, the impact is small in magnitude. Global spillovers are limited to sectors linked to EU industries via intermediate goods trade, with no significant effects beyond these supply chain linkages. Overall, the unintended consequences of EU climate policies appear negligible, with minimal effects on targeted industries’ stock returns and no spillovers outside supply chain linkages.</content>

    <title>Information-Concealing Credit Architecture</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When the value of a pledgeable asset (or project) is uncertain, investors are tempted to examine it. The asset owner ultimately bears the information cost, reducing her financing capacity. A pecking order emerges. Debt generates a greater financing capacity than equity: unlike equity investors who own the asset directly, creditors own the asset only if the borrower defaults and, therefore, have weaker incentives to acquire information. Probabilistic asset ownership can be further diluted by introducing intermediaries between the borrower and the creditor, leading to a new theory of financial intermediation and credit chains. We demonstrate that the optimal financial architecture involves systematically sequencing multiple intermediaries with heterogeneous information costs and asset correlations, rationalizing the seemingly excessive complexity of intermediated credit flows.</content>

    <title>Sorting to Expensive Cities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a spatial equilibrium model with heterogeneous households holding general non-homothetic preferences over tradable goods and housing. In equilibrium, desirable and productive locations command high housing prices. So long as housing is a necessity, these locations are disproportionately inhabited by high-income earners who are relatively less affected by high housing prices. We clarify how this source of sorting complements other potential sorting forces in spatial equilibrium models, namely, comparative advantage in production and heterogeneous preferences for locations. We show how to measure changes in welfare inequality across income groups in a theoretically-consistent way when housing is a necessity, extending the approach popular in models with homothetic preferences. We use our framework to track the evolution of welfare inequality between college and non-college graduates in the United States between 1980 and 2020. We find that, accounting for change in prices, it has risen by more than nominal wage inequality, even as college graduates increasingly sort into cities with expensive housing over this time period.</content>

    <title>Asset Embeddings</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firm characteristics, based on accounting and financial market data, are commonly used to represent firms in economics and finance. However, investors collectively use a much richer information set beyond firm characteristics, including sources of information that are not readily available to researchers. We show theoretically that portfolio holdings contain all relevant information for asset pricing, which can be recovered under empirically realistic conditions. Such guarantees do not exist for other data sources, such as accounting or text data. We build on recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) that represent unstructured data (e.g., text, audio, and images) by high-dimensional latent vectors called embeddings. Just as word embeddings leverage the document structure to represent words, asset embeddings leverage portfolio holdings to represent firms. Thus, this paper is a bridge from recent advances in AI and ML to economics and finance. We explore various methods to estimate asset embeddings, including recommender systems, shallow neural network models such as Word2Vec, and transformer models such as BERT. We evaluate the performance of these models on three benchmarks that can be evaluated using a single quarter of data: predicting relative valuations, explaining the comovement of stock returns, and predicting institutional portfolio decisions. We also estimate investor embeddings (i.e., representations of investors and their strategies), which are useful for investor classification, performance evaluation, and detecting crowded trades. We discuss other applications of asset embeddings, including generative portfolios, risk management, and stress testing. Finally, we develop a framework to give an economic narrative to a group of similar firms, by applying large language models to firm-level text data.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is much disagreement about the extent to which financial incentives motivate study participants. We elicit preferences for being paid for completing a survey, including a one-in-twenty chance of winning a $100 electronic gift card, a guaranteed electronic gift card with the same expected value, and an option to refuse payment. More than twice as many participants chose the lottery as chose the guaranteed payment.  Given that most people are risk averse, this pattern suggests that factors beyond risk preferences—such as hassle costs—influenced their decision-making. Almost 20 percent of participants actively refused payment, demonstrating low monetary motivation. We find both systematic and unobserved heterogeneity in the characteristics of who turned down payment. The propensity to refuse payment is more than four times as large among individuals 50 and older compared to younger individuals, suggesting a tradeoff between financially motivating participants and obtaining a representative sample. Overall, our results suggest that modest electronic gift card payments violate key requirements of Vernon Smith’s induced value theory.</content>

    <title>Counting the Poor: The Liquidity-Adjusted Supplemental Expenditure Poverty Measure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most poverty calculations use income-based or consumption-based measures. We introduce a new, third measure of poverty status which is based on household expenditure. Expenditure is the theoretically correct measure of resources actually transferred into a given period in the life cycle. But the presence of illiquid service flows from durable goods, which can only be used to purchase that good in the minimum standard of living bundle and no other good, requires an adjustment both to resources and to the poverty threshold to allow a proper comparison of liquid resources to liquidity-adjusted thresholds. We also show that the expenditure impact of transfers on the poverty rate requires an adjustment for effects of transfers on precautionary saving and for their role as consumption insurance. Using the 2009-2022 Consumer Expenditure Survey, our liquidity-adjusted poverty measure yields a 2022 poverty rate of 8.3 percent, declining by 11 percent since 2009. Our measure trends in broadly similar ways to income- and consumption-based measures but only because differences in how thresholds and resources are calculated are offsetting. We also find that accounting for precautionary saving and the insurance role of transfers could make the anti-poverty impact of transfers somewhat smaller than that estimated ignoring these effects.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) indicate an unprecedented 43 percent increase in the number of people residing in homeless shelters in the United States between 2022 and 2024, reversing the gradual decline over the preceding sixteen years. Three-quarters of this rise was concentrated in four localities – New York City, Chicago, Massachusetts, and Denver – where large inflows of new immigrants seeking asylum were housed in emergency shelters. Using direct estimates from local government sources and indirect methods based on demographic changes, we estimate that asylum seekers accounted for about 60 percent of the two-year rise in sheltered homelessness during this period, challenging media and policy narratives that primarily attribute this rise to local economic conditions and housing affordability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies psychological biases in take-up of annuities, using an incentivized experiment with a probability-based sample (N = 3,038). Choosing an annuity was payoff-maximizing in the experiment at all prices, but take-up was incomplete and price elastic. Reformulating decisions as insurance against a “bad” outcome rather than insurance against “longevity risk” did not increase take-up. Instead, we find substantial failures of contingent reasoning: participants under-appreciated how annuitization mitigated the need for less-efficient means of saving for retirement. Increasing the salience of the interaction with savings decisions, or eliminating the need to think through this interaction altogether, substantially increased annuity take-up.</content>

American workplaces show an educational segregation, measured by the degree to which the establishment has mostly workers of similar education levels, that is comparable to racial residential segregation in a typical metro area. Workplace isolation was particularly high for young and male workers without college degrees. The isolation of non-college workers is increasing over time.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) supplies livelihoods and critical minerals but has been linked to conflict and environmental degradation. We enable monitoring of this largely informal sector by creating high-resolution maps of ASM's footprint in Africa using machine learning models that integrate geographic features and satellite imagery. We find ASM is more extensive than documented: in five countries with on-the-ground surveys, we predict over 231,000 1-km2 grid cells [±2 standard errors: 170,153-297,710] contain ASM activity – over 40 times that recorded by surveyors. Adapting methods for spatial domain adaptation, we map ASM across 20 total countries, estimating that 4% [2-8%] of territory and 17% [10-30%] of the population are impacted by ASM, which encroaches on a larger share of settlements and ecosystems than previously understood.</content>

    <title>The Conflict-of-Interest Discount in the Marketplace of Ideas</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how conflicts of interest (CoI)—defined as financial, professional, or ideological stakes held by authors—affect perceived credibility in economics research. Using a randomized controlled survey of both economists and a representative sample of the U.S. public, we find that the presence of a CoI reduces trust in a paper’s findings by 28% on average, with substantial heterogeneity across conflict types. We develop a model in which this reduction in trust reflects both the prevalence of conflicted papers and the expected bias conditional on conflict. To isolate the latter, we introduce the CoI Discount: the perceived value of a conflicted paper relative to an otherwise identical, non-conflicted one. We estimate an average CoI Discount of 39%, implying that conflicted papers are valued at just 61% of non-conflicted ones. We validate these survey-based estimates through three complementary exercises: an empirical analysis of actual citation and disclosure patterns in economics, a meta-analysis of evidence from the medical literature, and simulations using large-language models. Our findings highlight a persistent credibility gap that is not eliminated by current disclosure practices and suggest a broader challenge for scientific trust in the presence of author conflicts.</content>

    <title>The Effects of Deleting Medical Debt from Consumer Credit Reports</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One in seven Americans carry medical debt, with $88 billion reported on consumer credit reports. In April 2023, the three major credit bureaus stopped reporting medical debts below $500. We study the effects of this information deletion on consumer credit scores, credit limits and utilization, repayment behavior, and payday borrowing. Using a machine learning model, we show that small medical debts are not meaningfully predictive of defaults, suggesting their deletion should have minimal effect on lending decisions. We test this prediction using two complementary research designs. First, a regression discontinuity analysis comparing individuals above and below the $500 threshold finds no direct benefits from the information deletion, ruling out small changes in credit access. Second, to assess indirect effects, we classify consumers based on whether their predicted default probability increases or decreases when debts are deleted. A difference-in-differences analysis comparing these groups before and after the 2023 policy change reveals no evidence of negative spillover effects. Finally, we show that larger medical debts (≥ $500) are also not meaningfully predictive of default, suggesting that eliminating medical debts entirely from credit reports, as planned under a January 2025 decision by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is unlikely to affect credit outcomes.</content>

    <title>Forward Selection Fama-MacBeth Regression with Higher Order Asset-Pricing Factors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that the higher-orders and their interactions of the common sparse linear factors can effectively subsume the factor zoo. We propose a forward selection Fama-MacBeth procedure as a method to estimate a high-dimensional stochastic discount factor model, isolating the most relevant higher-order factors. Applying this approach to terms derived from six widely used factors (the Fama-French five-factor model and the momentum factor), we show that the resulting higher-order model with only a small number of selected higher-order terms significantly outperforms traditional benchmarks both in-sample and out-of-sample. Moreover, it effectively subsumes a majority of the factors from the extensive factor zoo, suggesting that the pricing power of most zoo factors is attributable to their exposure to higher-order terms of common linear factors.</content>

    <title>Credit, Land Speculation, and Low-Interest-Rate Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper analyses the impact of credit expansions arising from increases in collateral values or lower interest rate policies on long-run productivity and economic growth in a two-sector endogenous growth economy with credit frictions, with the driver of growth lying in one sector (manufacturing) but not in the other (real estate). We show that it is not so much aggregate credit expansion that matters for long-run productivity and economic growth but sectoral credit expansions. Credit expansions associated mainly with relaxation of real estate financing (capital investment financing) will be productivity-and growth-retarding (enhancing). Without financial regulations, low interest rates and more expansionary monetary policy may so encourage land speculation using leverage that productive capital investment and economic growth are decreased. Unlike in standard macroeconomic models, in ours, the equilibrium price of land will be finite even if the safe rate of interest is less than the rate of output growth.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Public service reforms often provoke political backlash. Can they also yield political benefits for the politicians who champion them? We study a Wisconsin law that weakened teachers’ unions and liberalized pay, prompting mass protests. Exploiting its staggered implementation across school districts, we find that the reform cut union revenues, raised student test scores, and increased pay for some teachers. Exposure to the law increased the incumbent governor’s vote share by about 20% of his margin of victory and reduced campaign contributions to his opponent. Gains were larger in districts with stronger unions ex ante and in those where more voters benefited from the reform. Our findings highlight how even politically risky reforms can generate electoral benefits under the right circumstances.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how artificial intelligence transforms the core pillars of collaboration—performance, expertise sharing, and social engagement—through a pre-registered field experiment with 776 professionals at Procter &amp; Gamble, a global consumer packaged goods company. Working on real product innovation challenges, professionals were randomly assigned to work either with or without AI, and either individually or with another professional in new product development teams. Our findings reveal that AI significantly enhances performance: individuals with AI matched the performance of teams without AI, demonstrating that AI can effectively replicate certain benefits of human collaboration. Moreover, AI breaks down functional silos. Without AI, R&amp;D professionals tended to suggest more technical solutions, while Commercial professionals leaned towards commercially-oriented proposals. Professionals using AI produced balanced solutions, regardless of their professional background. Finally, AI’s language-based interface prompted more positive self-reported emotional responses among participants, suggesting it can fulfill part of the social and motivational role traditionally offered by human teammates. Our results suggest that AI adoption at scale in knowledge work reshapes not only performance but also how expertise and social connectivity manifest within teams, compelling organizations to rethink the very structure of collaborative work.</content>

    <title>Measuring Human Leadership Skills with AI Agents</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that leadership skill with artificially intelligent (AI) agents predicts leadership skill with human groups. In a large pre-registered lab experiment, human leaders worked with AI agents to solve problems. Their performance on this “AI leadership test” was strongly correlated (ρ=0.81) with their causal impact as leaders of human teams, which we estimate by repeatedly randomly assigning leaders to groups of human followers and measuring team performance. Successful leaders of both humans and AI agents ask more questions and engage in more conversational turn-taking; they score higher on measures of social intelligence, fluid intelligence, and decision-making skill, but do not differ in gender, age, ethnicity or education. Our findings indicate that AI agents can be effective proxies for human participants in social experiments, which greatly simplifies the measurement of leadership and teamwork skills.</content>

    <title>Voluntary Report of Standardized Test Scores: An Experimental Study</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The past few years have seen a shift in many universities' admission policies from test-required to either test-optional or test-blind. This paper uses laboratory experiments to examine students' reporting behavior given their application package and the school's interpretation of non-reported standardized test scores. We find that voluntary disclosure is incomplete and selective, supporting the incentives of both partial unraveling and reverse unraveling. Subjects exhibit some ability to learn about the hidden school interpretation, though their learning is imperfect. Using a structural model of student reporting behavior, we simulate the potential tradeoff between academic preparedness and diversity in a school's admission cohort. We find that, if students have perfect information about the school's interpretation of non-reporting, test-blind is the worst and test-required is the best in both dimensions, while test-optional lies between the two extremes. When students do not have perfect information, some test-optional policies can generate more diversity than test-required, because some students with better observable attributes may underestimate the penalty on their non-reporting. This allows the school to admit more students that have worse observable attributes but report. We test the results’ robustness to a variety of extensions.</content>

    <title>AI as Strategist</title>
    <updated>2025-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Joshua S. Gans</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the role of artificial intelligence as a strategist in organizational decision-making by extending van den Steen's formal theory of strategy. A mathematical model is developed comparing AI and human strategists across different decision contexts, focusing on how each type generates confidence, achieves agreement, and implements decisions through control versus influence. The analysis presumes that AI excels in data-rich domains but faces credibility challenges in judgment-intensive contexts, creating a counterintuitive result where AI requires less formal authority precisely where it demonstrates superior analytical capabilities. The paper identifies distinct mechanisms through which strategic value is created: direct decision quality improvement and enhanced coordination. The authors propose domain-contingent approaches to AI integration, including differentiated authority systems across decision types and progressive control models that evolve as AI demonstrates effectiveness. These findings contribute to strategy theory while providing practical guidance for organizations seeking to effectively integrate AI into strategic processes, highlighting that organizations must adapt to their strategists' capabilities as much as strategists must match their organizations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Tokens offer convenience in digital networks and earn rewards when staked for consensus generation or economic activities. In our continuous-time model, agents dynamically allocate wealth over on-platform transactions and staking. Aggregate staking ratio crucially shapes platform productivity, grows userbase, and links staking to endogenous reward rates and price dynamics. Transaction fees, token issuance, and user heterogeneity all affect platform lifecycle. Empirical findings support the theoretical predictions: (i) correlation between staking ratio and reward rate is cross-sectionally positive, but time-series-wise negative; (ii) staking ratios positively predict excess returns; (iii) the convenience wedge generates UIP violations and significant crypto carry premia.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Oracles are software components that enable data exchange between siloed blockchains and external environments, enhancing smart contract capabilities and platform interoperability. Oracles play key roles in decentralized finance and blockchain applications in centralized finance. We find that integration into decentralized oracle networks is positively associated with key measures of economic activity such as Total Value Locked, triggered by positive network effects in adoption and usage. Our study reveals symbiotic gains from enhanced interoperability and network effects across protocols on a given chain and among integrated chains. Oracle integration appears to improve risk-sharing and mitigates contagion, increasing resilience during turbulent periods in crypto markets. Overall, oracles emerge as a crucial component to enable informational and economic integration in decentralized finance ecosystems.</content>

    <title>The Bullwhip: Time-to-Build and Sectoral Fluctuations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a theory of sectoral fluctuations driven by the propagation of demand shocks along supply chains with heterogeneous time-to-build production. We solve the model in closed form. Downstream producers respond directly to current demand. Upstream producers, due to time-to-build delays, respond to anticipated future demand. Consequently, hump-shaped demand shocks to downstream goods propagate and amplify along the supply chain, generating pronounced volatility in upstream sectors and creating the bullwhip effect. Empirically and quantitatively, we show that the bullwhip is significant across downstream sectors that are important for final consumption.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Landmark results from the Women's Health Initiative trial showed that random assignment to menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) elevated risks of breast cancer and other adverse events. Recent analyses argue that MHT risks are small. These analyses report intention-to-treat (ITT) effects, ignoring the fact that many women assigned intervention were non-adherent, while many women assigned control initiated treatment. Instrumental variable (IV) methods and adherence data allow us to estimate effects of MHT on compliers who took MHT if and only if assigned. IV estimates show risks and benefits that are substantially larger than the ITT estimates used to inform MHT guidelines.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter reviews the analysis of non-wage amenities in the workplace. The competitive model is the point of departure, but the emphasis is on models of imperfect competition that have greater empirical relevance. In addition to the traditional hedonic model for estimating preferences over job characteristics, I review revealed-preference methods that are better suited when there are deviations from perfect competition.</content>

    <title>Non-User Utility and Market Power: The Case of Smartphones</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms can increase the demand for their products and consolidate their market power not only by increasing user utility but also by decreasing non-user utility. In this paper, we examine this mechanism by considering the case of smartphones. In particular, Apple has faced criticism for allegedly degrading the Android user experience by making messages to Android devices appear as green bubbles on iPhones—a salient signal often perceived as reflecting a lower socioeconomic status. Using samples of US college students, we show that green bubbles are widely stigmatized and that a majority of both iPhone and Android users would prefer green bubbles to no longer exist. We then conduct an incentivized deactivation experiment, revealing that iPhone users have a significant willingness to pay to prevent their messages from appearing as green bubbles on other iPhones. Next, we examine the market implications of non-user utility and find that respondents are substantially more likely to choose an Android over an iPhone when green bubbles are removed. We conclude by presenting case studies that illustrate how companies use product features to reduce non-user utility in various markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The decline in housing affordability over recent decades has promoted an enhanced interest in housing supply. This chapter presents descriptive evidence about the evolution of us housing prices, quantities, and regulations since 1980, indicating that supply constraints appear to be increasingly binding. We then provide an overview of the various approaches used to model construction and land development for homogeneous and heterogeneous housing in static and dynamic contexts to understand housing supply. Our treatment incorporates empirical implementation and policy implications throughout. Finally, we provide an overview of quantitative evidence on the consequences of relaxing various types of supply constraints.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Are defined contribution (DC) pension funds' capital flows sensitive to performance? We examine pressures from individual account holders who can switch their pension managers. Using novel data on retirement accounts for nearly 10 million individuals, we analyze switching behavior based on the plan’s risk profile. Switching across managers within the same pension product is not uncommon, and the tendency to change managers rises over time. Capital flows are sensitive to and increase with fund performance. This sensitivity creates pressure on managers, shaping their incentives and portfolio decisions. A quasi-exogenous increase in outflows leads managers to shift toward higher-yielding bond holdings.</content>

    <title>Public Finance Implications of Economic Inequality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper considers questions about the implications of rising inequality for the theory and practice of public finance. It begins by addressing fundamental reasons why the distribution of income or wealth on an annual basis before taxes and transfers offers insufficient information: (1) it does not tell us what resources are actually available to households for consumption; and (2) in providing a snapshot of the resources available to individuals of different ages at a given moment in time, without controlling for life-cycle related differences or income dynamics, it can provide a misleading estimate of the underlying degree of inequality. The paper then considers the implications of high and perhaps rising economic inequality for the design of government policy: top marginal tax rates, phase-outs of government policies for those with higher incomes, the political economy of inequality, and other subjects.</content>

    <title>Does Homeownership Matter? The Long-Term Consequences of Losing a House during the Great Recession</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the long-term impact of keeping versus losing one’s home following a mortgage delinquency in the aftermath of the Great Recession, studying the trajectory of homeownership, consumption, and financial well-being over the subsequent decade. Our research design leverages the substantial number of households that experienced temporary income shocks and the turbulence of the foreclosure crisis — we focus on individuals who were seriously delinquent on their mortgages and compare outcomes between those who received a mortgage modification and those who did not. These two groups exhibit highly similar pre-trends in financial outcomes prior and during the Great Recession but diverge by 36 percentage points in their short-term likelihood of retaining homeownership. More than half of this disparity persists nearly a decade later, translating into an average capital gain of $83,000 in the housing market. Despite these significant differences in homeownership and wealth accumulation, keeping a home does not appear to influence the path of creditworthiness, proxies for consumption, and the income rank of one's residential neighborhood.</content>

    <title>The Long Road to Equality: Racial Capital and Generational Convergence</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce the concept of racial capital, defined as the collective material and non- material assets of the racial groups to which a child is exposed while growing up, and examine its potential to explain racial disparities in life outcomes that persist even after accounting for a broad range of parental and neighborhood resources. Estimates for Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White children born around 1980 imply that metro-level racial capital measures: (i) have substantial power to explain racial differences in life outcomes, (ii) sharply close and, in many cases, reverse the sign of racial intergenerational mobility gaps in education, income, and employment, and (iii) matter most when racial dissociation, as measured by residential and marriage segregation, is greatest. In contrast to standard estimates, our empirical framework implies a steady state equilibrium that is characterized by near equality for Black and White Americans. The inclusion of racial capital in the model, however, greatly slows the speed of convergence to the steady state, helping to explain the historically slow speed of racial economic convergence in the United States over the past two centuries. Finally, our framework highlights the complementary way that policies related to racial dissociation and wealth transfers affect the speed of convergence across generations.</content>

    <title>Interventionist Preferences and the Welfare State: The Case of In-Kind Aid</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why is in-kind aid a prominent feature of welfare systems? We present a lab-in-the-field experiment involving members of the general U.S. population and SNAP recipients. After documenting a widespread desire to limit recipients’ choices, we quantify the relative importance of (i) welfarist motives, (ii) utility or disutility derived from curtailing another’s autonomy, and (iii) absolutist attitudes concerning the appropriate form of aid. Choices primarily reflect the two non-welfarist motives. Because people systematically misperceive recipient preferences, their interventions are more restrictive than they intend. Interventionist preferences and non-welfarist motives are more pronounced among the political right, particularly when recipients are black.</content>

    <title>The Long-Run Impacts of Mentoring Underrepresented Minority Groups in Economics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a long-run evaluation of one of the oldest professional mentoring programs for underrepresented groups in economics, the American Economic Association Mentoring Program (AEAMP). The AEAMP was established to address the underrepresentation of racial/ethnic minority groups by mentoring doctoral students and new Ph.D.s in economics. We compare professional outcomes of mentees with similar individuals from the same Ph.D. cohort who did not participate in the program. While there are no differences for many outcomes, mentees are more likely to hold a tenure-track or tenured position. Our results point to the potential for mentoring programs to address persistent racial/ethnic disparities.</content>

    <title>Labor Market Polarization and Inequality: A Roy Model Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the forces driving polarization and higher wage inequality since 1980 using a structural model of occupation choice in the tradition of Roy (1951). In our model, changes in relative occupational skill prices proxy for changes in relative demand for occupational labor services. Our analysis yields three main findings. First, although changes in skill prices have quantitatively important effects on employment shares and mean wages, they play essentially no role in accounting for the sharp rise in wage inequality. Second, changes in relative wages are driven by changes in higher order moments and do not reflect changes in relative demand. Third, changes in the variance of idiosyncratic within occupation productivity are the dominant factor behind the sharp rise in inequality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How good is AI at persuading humans to perform costly actions? We study calls made to get delinquent consumer borrowers to repay. Regression discontinuity and a randomized experiment reveal that AI is substantially less effective than human callers. Replacing AI with humans six days into delinquency closes much of the gap. But borrowers initially contacted by AI have repaid 1% less of the initial late payment one year later and are more likely to miss subsequent payments than borrowers who were always called by humans. AI’s lesser ability to extract promises that feel binding may contribute to the performance gap.</content>

    <title>Scoring and Cartel Discipline in Procurement Auctions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Auctioneers suspecting bidder collusion often lack the formal evidence needed for legal recourse. A practical alternative is to design auctions that hinder collusion. Since Abreu et al. (1986), economic theory has emphasized imperfect monitoring as a constraint on collusion, but evidence remains scarce on whether: (i) information frictions meaningfully limit real-world collusion; and (ii) auctioneers can effectively exploit these frictions. Indeed, transparency concerns often prevent the introduction of explicit randomness in auction design. We make progress on this issue by studying the impact of subjective scoring in auctions run by Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transportation. The adoption of scoring auctions significantly reduced winning bids in ways inconsistent with competition. Model-based inference suggests that the cartel’s dynamic obedience constraints were binding and were tightened by imperfect monitoring. Subjective scoring can successfully leverage imperfect monitoring frictions to reduce the scope of collusion.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents a holistic view of the channels of political influence of large corporations in modern democracies, focusing not only on well-studied instruments, such as campaign contributions and lobbying, but also on more opaque ones, such as charitable giving, political connections, dark money, public advocacy, and employee mobilization. Our quantitative perspective draws on recent work on US politics, including congressional voting, special interest politics, corporate political connections, grassroots, and philanthropic activities. In the process, the chapter offers also a discussion of recent methodological innovations around money in politics. We conclude with some considerations on corporate political disclosure.</content>

    <title>Quotas in General Equilibrium</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze economies with quotas and other quantity-based distortions. We show that any feasible, distorted allocation of resources can be implemented as the competitive equilibrium of an economy with quotas. Unlike economies with wedges, economies with quotas are constrained efficient and thus satisfy macro-envelope conditions. This means that the effects of changes in technologies, distortions, or policies can be expressed in terms of a small set of sufficient statistics. We provide a non-parametric and nonlinear characterization of the effects of quota and productivity changes on aggregate output. We also calculate the costs of misallocation due to quotas. These costs are expressed in terms of the price elasticities of an inverse demand system capturing how quota prices respond to changes in quota levels. We illustrate our results using several examples: we estimate efficiency gains from increasing the cap on H-1B visas, relaxing zoning restrictions on single-family housing in American cities, removing capital controls in Argentina, phasing out U.S. quotas on Chinese clothing and textiles, and eliminating the taxicab medallion system in New York City. Our results offer a flexible method for quantifying the costs of quota distortions and the effects of policy reforms across these settings.</content>

    <title>If You Had One Shot: Scale and Herding in Innovation Experiments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Solving complex problems- in medicine, engineering, and other technological domains- often requires exploring multiple approaches, particularly when significant uncertainty exists about which one will lead to success. Conventional wisdom assumes that having many experimenters independently decide which approaches to pursue increases diversity and, thus, also the chances of finding a solution. However, if experimenters herd toward the most promising approach, this convergence may reduce diversity and thus the likelihood of solving the problem. In this paper, we develop a simple model to show that, holding the total number of experiments constant, markets dominated by a few large-scale experimenters- firms conducting multiple experiments- explore more diverse approaches than markets with many single-shot experimenters. Single-shot experimenters tend to converge on the most promising approach, while multi-experimenters are more likely to diversify to avoid the correlation inherent in pursuing multiple experiments within the same approach. We test our model's predictions using data from pharmaceutical R&amp;D. Our analysis shows that increasing the average number of experiments per firm by one unit raises target diversity by over three standard deviations. In turn, a one-standard deviation increase from the mean in target diversity boosts the likelihood of at least one experiment reaching Phase 1 clinical trials by 25.9 percentage points. Our findings inform policies for the optimal allocation of experiments across firms to maximize approach diversity and market-level success.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Geoeconomics is the use of a country’s economic strength to exert influence on foreign entities to achieve geopolitical or economic goals. We discuss how concepts of power in the political science and economics literature can be used to guide research on geoeconomics. Economic threats as a form of coercion have seen a recent resurgence. We show how different types of threats can be modeled using simple tools and discuss what channels their potential effectiveness is based on. We discuss important open questions for the future literature to pursue.</content>

    <title>Pension Reform and Labor Supply: Retention and Productivity under a Pension Cut</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effect of a representative pension reform on the retention and productivity of workers. The reform cut pension annuities and early retirement benefits for public school teachers, projected to save eight percent of pension revenues. We leverage administrative records and a discontinuity in the reform to estimate its effect. Contrary to expectations, the cut increased retention by discouraging early retirement. Using idiosyncratic within-school variation in exposure, we find the reform somewhat increased student achievement by 0.01–0.03 standard deviations, partly through reduced turnover. The reform thus maintained or improved both teacher retention and productivity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops a complete-market production economy with heterogeneous beliefs about TFP growth. Hiring occurs before TFP is known and is, therefore, risky (operational leverage). The firm's discount factor depends on a wealth-weighted average of investors' beliefs. Waves of optimism influence asset markets and percolate to labor hiring, tying together the equity premium, equity volatility, and labor volatility puzzles. A taxonomy of belief systems shows that only extrapolative beliefs amplify the volatility of asset prices and hours and lead to risk build up. Disciplined by survey data, the model matches asset-pricing and business-cycle moments, highlighting how heterogeneous beliefs can be a direct driver of aggregate fluctuations.</content>

    <title>Paths to the Periphery</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;My research suggests that world inequality is explained by the incidence of extractive and inclusive institutions. But why do some countries have extractive institutions? I distinguish between two main reasons; first, power relations; second, the “normative order.” Normative orders provide justifications and legitimacy for institutions which may not generate prosperity, but may achieve other goals. These distinctions are critical because they create very different challenges in trying to make institutions more inclusive and create prosperity. I show how countries move from the economic periphery as a consequence of changing both. My own intellectual journey has been in the other direction, however, hence the title of the paper: I was fortunate to be born in Britain, but I have had to unlearn much of my own experience, socialization and training in order to see other societies on their own terms. That’s crucial to be able to help them, but also to learn from them.</content>

    <title>The Effects of Eviction on Children</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Eviction may be an important channel for the intergenerational transmission of poverty, and concerns about its effects on children are often raised as a rationale for tenant protection policies. We study how eviction impacts children's home environment, school engagement, educational achievement, and high school completion by assembling new data sets linking eviction court records in Chicago and New York to administrative public school records and restricted Census records. To disentangle the consequences of eviction from the effects of correlated sources of economic distress, we use a research design based on the random assignment of court cases to judges who vary in their leniency. We find that eviction increases children's residential mobility, homelessness, and likelihood of doubling up with grandparents or other adults. Eviction also disrupts school engagement, causing increased absences and school changes. While we find little impact on elementary and middle school test scores, eviction substantially reduces high school course credits. Lastly, we find that eviction reduces high school graduation and use a novel bounding method to show that this finding is not driven by differential attrition. The disruptive effects of eviction appear worse for older children and boys. Our evidence suggests that the impact of eviction on children runs through the disruption to the home environment or school engagement rather than deterioration in school or neighborhood quality, and may be moderated by access to family support networks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using limitations to the deductibility of interest payments triggered by the introduction of interest ceiling rules globally, we show that affected private firms reduce leverage relative to unaffected firms. In support of a causal effect of taxes on corporate capital structure choices, we show that the results hold for firms near the thresholds triggering the limitations, in a propensity score matched sample, and in countries required to adopt the interest ceiling rules. In contrast, falsification tests show no reduction in leverage for affected firms around pseudo-reform years. Furthermore, within a country, firms with a higher fraction of nondeductible interest payments are less responsive to tax rate changes. More broadly, across 93 countries, we document that private firms tend to decrease leverage in response to tax rate cuts and increase leverage in response to corporate tax rate hikes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a novel framework to study the interaction between monetary policy and trade. Our New Keynesian open economy model incorporates international production networks, sectoral heterogeneity in price rigidities, and trade distortions. We decompose the general equilibrium response to trade shocks into distinct channels that account for demand shifts, policy effects, exchange rate adjustments, expectations, price stickiness, and input–output linkages. Tariffs act simultaneously as demand and supply shocks, leading to endogenous fragmentation through changes in trade and production network linkages. We show that the net impact of tariffs on domestic inflation, output, employment, and the dollar depends on the endogenous monetary policy response in both the tariff-imposing and tariff-exposed countries, within a global general equilibrium framework. Our quantitative exercise replicates the observed effects of the 2018 tariffs on the U.S. economy and predicts a 1.6 pp decline in U.S. output, a 0.8 pp rise in inflation, and a 4.8% appreciation of the dollar in response to a retaliatory trade war linked to tariffs announced on “Liberation Day.” Tariff threats, even in the absence of actual implementation, are self-defeating—leading to a 4.1% appreciation of the dollar, 0.6% deflation, and a 0.7 pp decline in output, as agents re-optimize in anticipation of future distortions. Dollar appreciates less or even can depreciate under retaliation, tariff threats, and increased global uncertainty.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of a randomized therapy intervention on Nepali adolescents at risk of school dropout. Our study is the largest of its kind (N = 1,707) and is novel in that participation does not require a preexisting diagnosis. Ninety percent of those offered therapy participated, with younger adolescents demonstrating higher compliance. Among those who complied, therapy significantly reduced psychological distress, improved emotional regulation, and enhanced life perspective, even in individuals without baseline mental health issues. However, these improvements in well-being did not lead to increased school attendance or better cognitive performance, suggesting that additional interventions may be necessary to enhance educational engagement in low-resource settings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The period after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) was characterized by a considerable risk migration within global liquidity flows, away from cross-border bank lending towards international bond issuance. We show that the post-GFC shifts in the risk sensitivities of global liquidity flows are related to the tightness of the balance sheet (capital and leverage) constraints faced by international (bank and non-bank) lenders and to the migration of borrowers across funding sources. We document that the risk sensitivity of global liquidity flows is higher when funding is provided by financial intermediaries that are facing greater balance sheet constraints. We also provide evidence that the post-GFC migration of borrowers from cross-border loans to international debt securities was associated with a decline in the risk sensitivity of global liquidity flows to EME borrowers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines partisanship in public perceptions of the Federal Reserve. In all years from 2001 through 2023, trust in the Federal Reserve was highest for respondents of the same party as the President. The partisan effects were larger than other demographic differences in trust, but do not explain the large partisan gap in inflation expectations in those years. We conducted a new survey-based information experiment before and after the Presidential inauguration in 2025, and found a changed pattern: Republicans continued to have lower trust in the Fed than did Democrats, even after a Republican President was elected and took office. Yet, Republicans had much lower inflation expectations than Democrats. Responses to open-ended survey questions point to tariffs and President Trump himself as most salient to consumers when considering how inflation will evolve.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Training investments are essential for improving worker and firm productivity, yet their implementation is often hindered by low participation rates and insufficient worker engagement. This study uses data from three firms—a car manufacturer, a quick-service restaurant chain, and a retail company—to show that variation in training participation among employees is closely tied to differences in middle managers’ behavior and practices. Middle managers who actively engage with their employees and emphasize their well-being and development are associated with significantly higher participation in training programs. These managerial differences significantly influence employee performance and absenteeism, especially during periods of organizational change. Together, these findings underscore the importance of middle managers in bridging the gap between centrally designed HR policies and their effective on-the-ground execution.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of encouragement emails sent to high-performing students in a principles of microeconomics course at a large state university, aimed at motivating them to take additional economics courses and consider an economics major or minor. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find some evidence of an increase in the likelihood of enrolling in intermediate microeconomics, especially for first-generation college students and underrepresented minorities, but limited effects on major switching or declaring an economics minor. Our findings suggest sustained interventions may be necessary to produce lasting effects</content>

    <title>Anticipated Discrimination and Major Choice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study whether gender differences in university major choices result from anticipated labor market discrimination. First, we document two novel facts using administrative transcript records from a large Midwestern university: women are less likely to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) as well as business and economics, but 1) those who do are positively selected on ability, and 2) obtain higher grades conditional on ability. Second, we show that these facts are consistent with a signaling model in which women anticipate greater labor market discrimination in STEM, business, and economics than in other fields. Third, we provide direct empirical evidence of anticipated discrimination using a student survey. The survey reveals striking patterns of anticipated discrimination by women, particularly in STEM, business, and economics, affecting both expected economic outcomes such as wages as well as expected workplace conditions. We conclude by showing that anticipated discrimination explains women's course taking and intended major choices, but not men's.</content>

    <title>Educational Ambition, Marital Sorting, and Inequality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper revisits the link between education-based marriage market sorting and income inequality. Leveraging Danish administrative data, we develop a novel categorization of “ambition types” that is based on starting wages and wage growth trajectories associated with detailed educational programs. We find a substantial increase in assortative matching by educational ambition over time, and the marriage market explains more than 40% of increasing inequality since 1980. In contrast, sorting trends are flat with the commonly-used educational level categorization. We conclude that the mapping from education to types matters crucially for conclusions about how education-based marriage market sorting contributes to rising income inequality.</content>

    <title>Measuring Income and Income Inequality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Income inequality is important, but attempts to measure it arrive at strikingly different conclusions. Why? We use recent disputes over measuring United States income inequality to return to first principles about both the income concept and inequality measurement. We emphasize two broad points. First, no measure of the income distribution is truly comprehensive, or could attempt to be comprehensive without making controversial choices. We document the practical and conceptual problems that the standard ideal—comprehensive Haig-Simons income—raises. Second, much of the controversy in this area turns on the many tradeoffs between starting with individual tax data versus attempting to match more expansive income concepts. Individual tax data reflects only a shrinking subset of a more comprehensive income concept—but it is individual data. Broader alternatives, on the other hand, are harder to allocate to individuals. We document some of the most important and contestable assumptions that allocating national income requires.</content>

    <title>Do Time-Constraints Matter? How, Why, and For Whom?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Exams are designed to rank students objectively by their abilities, including elements such as time limits, the number and difficulty of questions, and negative marking policies. Using data from a lab-in-field experiment, we develop and estimate a model of student behavior in multiple-choice exams that incorporates the effects of time constraints and use it to conduct policy analyses for designing more efficient exams in sorting students. We find that additional time benefits men more than women. Our estimated model shows that this is driven by gender differences in the signal production function for the correct answers. Time has a smaller impact on women, while ability and difficulty play a larger role. Risk aversion, in contrast to what is suggested in the literature, does not differ significantly by gender, and confidence rises with more time. Our policy experiments find that exams more effectively rank students when ranking is gender-specific and that time pressure, question difficulty, and student ability have non-monotonic effects on sorting.</content>

    <title>Substitution Bias and Fixed-Weight Price Indices in Time-Dependent Pricing Models</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper compares inflation in true price indices to inflation in fixed-weight price indices. We construct model-based inflation measures in time-dependent pricing models that are analogous to measures of inflation in the data, e.g., the Consumer Price Index. In the standard new Keynesian model, when inflation rises rapidly, the differences between inflation in those indices and true price indices are increasing in the degree of price stickiness and the elasticity of substitution across goods. For commonly used parameter values, those differences are large and persistent for increases in inflation of the size seen after 2020 in the U.S.</content>

    <title>Interim Valuations, Predictability, and Outcomes in Private Equity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a novel dataset of U.S. buyout and VC investments, we study the informativeness of fund managers’ interim valuation reports about portfolio companies on final outcomes. We find that when investors assess the performance of individual portfolio companies, they can do better than just relying on the most recent reported valuation. The history of reported valuations is also informative. Investments with greater past staleness or more frequent markdowns tend to perform more poorly in the future than other investments. We also find that the timing of an investment’s exit is predictable. Moreover, the combined knowledge of interim realized and unrealized returns, past staleness, and past markdown frequency can help predict whether an investment will end up in the left or right tail of all investments. These predictions are informative as early as the first year of the investment.</content>

    <title>Firm Selection and Growth in Carbon Offset Markets: Evidence from the Clean Development Mechanism</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study carbon offsets sold by firms in China under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). We find that offset-selling firms, meant to cut carbon emissions, instead increase them by 49% after starting an offset project. In a model of firm investment decisions and offset review, we estimate that CDM firms increase emissions due to both the selection of higher-growth firms into projects (35 pp) and because offset projects themselves boost firm growth and therefore emissions (14 pp). The CDM reduces global surplus by causing damages from increased emissions four times greater than private gains from trade in the offset market.</content>
