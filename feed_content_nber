    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Market definition is essential for antitrust analysis, but challenging in settings with network effects, where substitution patterns depend on changes in network size. To address this challenge, we conduct an incentivized experiment to measure substitution patterns for TikTok, a popular social media platform. Our experiment, conducted during a time of high uncertainty about a potential U.S. TikTok ban, compares changes in the valuation of other social apps under individual and collective TikTok deactivations. Consistent with a simple framework, the valuations of alternative social apps increase more in response to a collective TikTok ban than to an individual TikTok deactivation. Our framework and estimates highlight that individual and collective treatments can even lead to qualitatively different conclusions about which alternative goods are substitutes.</content>

    <title>Financial Firepower: School Shootings and the Strategic Contributions of Pro-Gun PACs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fatal school shootings often spark support for stricter gun laws, threatening the gun lobby’s influence and agenda. To prevent political fallout, do pro-gun Political Action Committees increase contributions after fatal school shootings? Leveraging a novel dataset of pro-gun PAC contributions and school shooting incidents, we implement a difference-in-differences design with staggered treatment adoption to estimate the causal effect of school shootings on contributions to House candidates. We find that pro-gun PACs increase contributions by 30.2% to candidates in districts with fatal school shootings, but show no significant response to non-fatal school shootings or other mass shootings. The temporal pattern reveals strategic behavior: contribution spikes emerge in the wake of fatal school shootings and in proximity to elections, with effects dramatically amplified as Election Day approaches; within two months of Election Day, contributions increase by 1,730%. These effects are concentrated in competitive districts (margins of 5%). Our findings provide robust evidence that pro-gun PACs deploy targeted financial contributions in response to school shootings, with the magnitude and timing suggesting a strategic counter-mobilization effort to maintain influence in affected districts when gun policy becomes locally salient and elections are near. Our findings underscore a gap in democratic accountability: while public opinion should drive policy change, organized interests with financial power can insulate political candidates from public pressure and obstruct its translation into legislative reform.</content>

    <title>Public and Private Transit: Evidence from Lagos</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Private minibuses dominate transport in many developing country cities. They serve 62% of trips in Lagos, the largest city in sub-Saharan Africa. We collect panel data to measure how private minibuses respond to the rollout of a new public bus network. When the government enters a route, minibuses depart less frequently, driver profits fall, and drivers switch to connected routes, reducing prices. We develop a custom app to estimate how commuters trade off prices and wait times in an RCT. The private response harms commuters on treated routes, who wait longer, but benefits those on connected routes, who face only lower prices. Overall, 10% of the commuter welfare gains of building the public transit system arise from the response of private transit. Drivers lose welfare equal to half of the commuter gains.</content>

    <title>A Dynamic Theory of Optimal Tariffs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The classic tariff formula states that the optimal unilateral tariff equals the inverse of the foreign export supply elasticity. We generalize this result and show that an intertemporal tariff formula characterizes the efficient tariff in a large class of dynamic heterogeneous agent (HA) economies with multiple goods. Intertemporal export supply elasticities and relative tariff revenue weights are sufficient statistics for the optimal tariff that decentralizes the efficient allocation. We also develop a general theory of second-best optimal tariffs. In dynamic HA incomplete markets economies, Ramsey optimal tariffs trade off intertemporal terms of trade manipulation against production efficiency, risk-sharing, and redistribution. Intertemporal export supply elasticities and relative tariff revenue weights remain sufficient statistics for the intertemporal terms of trade manipulation motive of second-best optimal tariffs. We apply our results to a quantitative heterogeneous agent New Keynesian (HANK) model with trade.</content>

    <title>Public Debt Bubbles, Liquidity, and Risk: Policy Assessments Based on the Zero-Beta Interest Rate</title>
    <updated>2025-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Narayana R. Kocherlakota</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies stationary equilibria in a novel class of analytically tractable incomplete markets models with a public debt bubble (meaning that the interest rate r̅ on riskfree government bonds is less than the growth rate). Within the models, the return rᴋ to physical capital can exceed r̅  because capital is exposed to aggregate risk and because it is less liquid than public debt. I follow di Tella et al. (2024), and define r_zero to be the zero-beta interest rate (on an asset with no aggregate risk and the same (il)liquidity properties as physical capital). I provide two distinct sufficient conditions in a zero-growth economy under which the government can increase welfare by following a fiscal policy which induces a higher r̅ . The first case is that r_zero &lt; 0 (which also implies that r̅ &lt; 0). The second case is that r̅ &lt; 0 and r_zero (on average) satisfies the aggregate consumption Euler equation. I argue that the estimates of r_zero in di Tella et al. (2024) are in alignment with this second case.</content>

    <title>Capability Inversion: The Turing Test Meets Information Design</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper analyzes the design of tests to distinguish human from artificial intelligence through the lens of information design. We identify a fundamental asymmetry: while AI systems can strategically underperform to mimic human limitations, they cannot overperform beyond their capabilities. This leads to our main contribution—the concept of capability inversion domains, where AIs fail detection not through inferior performance, but by performing “suspiciously well” when they overestimate human capabilities. We show that if an AI significantly overestimates human ability in even one domain, it cannot reliably pass an optimally designed test. This insight reverses conventional intuition: effective tests should target not what humans do well, but the specific patterns of human imperfection that AIs systematically misunderstand. We identify structural sources of persistent misperception—including the difficulty of learning about failure from successful examples and fundamental differences in embodied experience—that make certain capability inversions exploitable for detection even as AI systems improve.</content>

    <title>From Tank to Odometer: Winners and Losers from a Gas-to-VMT Tax Shift</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the increase in fuel economy of the personal transportation fleet along with the increased penetration of hybrid and electric vehicles, federal motor vehicle fuel excise tax revenue has been steadily declining. This has led to calls for finding a replacement for this tax. One option is to replace the gas tax with a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) tax. To investigate the impact of such a tax swap, we combine data from the 2017 National Household Transportation Survey (NHTS) and the American Community Survey (ACS). Using machine learning techniques, we generate estimates of VMT and gasoline tax collections at the census tract level. This allows us to explore the distributional implications of this tax swap at a geographically disaggregated level. We find, as have previous researchers, that this tax swap is modestly progressive. Our more granular geographic analysis highlights striking disparities not previously reported. We find that rural areas and census tracts in the center of the country generally benefit from this tax swap, while urban and bicoastal areas generally experience higher taxation. Additionally, Republican-leaning districts, which overlap significantly with rural areas, see marked gains compared to Democratic districts.</content>

    <title>Measuring Industrial Policy: A Text-Based Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Since the 18th century, policymakers have debated the merits of industrial policy (IP). Yet, economists lack basic facts about its use due to measurement challenges. We propose a new approach to IP measurement based on information contained in policy text. We show how off-the-shelf supervised machine learning tools can be used to categorize industrial policies at scale. Using this approach, we validate long-standing concerns with earlier measurement approaches that conflate IP with other types of policy. We apply our methodology to a global database of commercial policy descriptions, and provide a first look at IP use at the country, industry, and year levels (2010-2022). The new data on IP suggest that i) IP is on the rise; ii) modern IP tends to use subsidies and export promotion measures as opposed to tariffs; iii) rich countries heavily dominate IP use; iv) IP tends to target sectors with an established comparative advantage, particularly in high-income countries.</content>

    <title>AI and Social Media: A Political Economy Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider the political consequences of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) by online platforms engaged in social media content dissemination, entertainment, or electronic commerce. We identify two distinct but complementary mechanisms, the social media channel and the digital ads channel, which together and separately contribute to the polarization of voters and consequently the polarization of parties. First, AI-driven recommendations aimed at maximizing user engagement on platforms create echo chambers (or “filter bubbles”) that increase the likelihood that individuals are not confronted with counter-attitudinal content. Consequently, social media engagement makes voters more polarized, and then parties respond by becoming more polarized themselves. Second, we show that party competition can encourage platforms to rely more on targeted digital ads for monetization (as opposed to a subscription-based business model), and such ads in turn make the electorate more polarized, further contributing to the polarization of parties. These effects do not arise when one party is dominant, in which case the profit-maximizing business model of the platform is subscription-based. We discuss the impact regulations can have on the polarizing effects of AI-powered online platforms.</content>

    <title>A Theory of Endogenous Degrowth and Environmental Sustainability</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop and quantify a novel growth theory in which economic activity endogenously shifts from material production to quality improvements. Consumers derive utility from goods with differing environmental footprints: necessities are material-intensive and polluting, while luxuries are more service-based and emit less. Innovation can be directed toward either material productivity or product~quality. Because demand for luxuries is more sensitive to quality, the economy gradually becomes “weightless”: growth is driven by quality improvements, services become the dominant employment sector, and material production stabilizes at a finite level. This structural transformation enables rising living standards with declining environmental intensity, providing an endogenous path to degrowth in material output without compromising economic progress. Policy can accelerate the transition, but its burden is uneven, falling more heavily on the poor than on the rich.</content>

    <title>Like Great-Grandparent, Like Great-Grandchild? Multigenerational Mobility in American History</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data on 2.5 million great-grandchildren linked to their great-grandfathers in the US (1850–1940), we show that economic gaps persisted strongly across four generations despite major structural change. We find that one-third of the initial differences in economic status across white great-grandfathers remained in their great-grandchildren. When including both Black and white families, this persistence rises to about 50 percent, largely because the gap between Black and white families closed slowly over time. Grandparent and great-grandparent status matter beyond the father's status, indicating slower convergence to the mean than predicted by two-generational estimates. However, this excess persistence is largely driven by enduring racial inequality as grandparent effects are small within the white population.</content>

    <title>Labor Markets in Developing Countries</title>
    <updated>2025-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Emily Breza &amp; Supreet Kaur</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The process of development is accompanied by marked changes in the structure of the labor market. We lay out a broad set of stylized features that distinguish developing country labor markets from those in richer countries. We organize our review around one particularly striking difference: in poor countries, working age individuals are employed in wage work only 20-50% of the time. There is evidence that this low wage employment reflects high levels of involuntary unemployment (often masked by self-employment), along with frictions such as wage rigidity, market power, and search and matching frictions. At the same time, there is growing documentation that workers prefer self-employment or unemployment to many of the wage jobs that are available to them, especially low-skill work in the formal sector. We offer evidence on several ways in which poverty itself can dampen labor supply, so that "low" labor supply may itself be an outcome of under-development. Throughout our review, we highlight how three core aspects of poverty—missing markets, the importance of social ties, and institutional irregularity—are important for understanding why developing country labor markets may behave differently from those in richer settings. This has relevance for understanding how labor markets change in response to, and help facilitate, the process of development.</content>

    <title>Defaulting 401(k) Assets into Payout Annuities for “Pretty Good” Lifetime Incomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Some US defined contribution plans offer retirees access to an annuity or lifetime income stream as payout options from their 401(k) accounts. Nevertheless, for behavioral reasons, some retirees  may hesitate to elect lifetime income streams as a drawdown vehicle. To counter this, plan sponsors could automatically allocate a portion of retirees’ 401(k) assets to annuities, now that regulatory barriers to doing so have eased. Using a lifecycle economic model, we evaluate the pros and cons of defaulting retirees’ 401(k) assets into payout annuities. We show that defaulting 20% of a retiree’s assets over a threshold into an immediate annuity enhances retirement security for most plan participants. An annuity deferred to the age of 80 is particularly beneficial to college graduates, in terms of enhancing their welfare</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on the social safety net examines its effects on recipients and their families. We show that these effects extend beyond recipients’ families. Using a regression discontinuity design and administrative data, we study a Danish policy that cut welfare benefits for refugees, increasing crime among affected individuals. Linking refugees to neighbors, we find increased crime among non-Danish neighbors, with spillovers persisting even after direct effects stabilize. Accounting for these spillovers raises the marginal value of public funds by 20%. We explore several mechanisms and find evidence consistent with peer effects among young individuals from the same country of origin.</content>

    <title>Does Matching Contribution Incentivize Informal Workers to Participate in Retirement Saving Plans? A Randomized Evaluation Interacted with a Natural Experiment</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conducted a large field experiment in Peru on informal workers and studied whether offering them a matching contribution raise participation and contributions in their Individual Retirement Accounts. We had three groups: a control group receiving no match, and two treatments groups receiving 50 and 100 percent match, respectively. Additionally, due to the time span, we can also analyze the difference responses between pre and during Covid-19. The results were as follows. First, the match incentive increases participation. Workers in the 50 and 100 percent match groups show participation rates of 5.2 and 6.5 p.p. higher than workers in the control group, respectively. The participation effect is also present pre Covid-19 and disappears during it. Second, the 100 percent match incentive was the only effective in increasing savings among all individuals (1.4 p.p.), pre (2.3 p.p.) and during Covid-19 (0.97 p.p.). This effect still presents in LATE specification with higher p.p. Third, 100% match was again the only effective to make contribute more than once, in the full sample (1.2 p.p.), and pre Covid-19 (2.7 p.p.), including LATE specification (full sample – 5.6 p.p.; pre Covid-19 – 8.2p.p.). Fourth the 50 percent match is not effective in raising contribution in any specification.</content>

    <title>Using AI to Generate Option C Scaling Ideas: A Case Study in Early Education</title>
    <updated>2025-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, field experiments have reshaped policy worldwide, but scaling ideas remains a thorny challenge. Perhaps the most important issue facing policymakers today is deciding which ideas to scale. One approach to attenuate this information problem is to augment traditional A/B experimental designs to address questions of scalability from the beginning. List 2024 denotes this approach as “Option C” thinking. Using early education as a case study, we show how AI can overcome a critical barrier in Option C thinking – generating viable options for scaling experimentation. By integrating AI-driven insights, this approach strengthens the link between controlled trials and large-scale implementation, ensuring the production of policy-based evidence for effective decision-making.</content>

    <title>Increasing Degree Attainment Among Low-Income Students: The Role of Intensive Advising and College Quality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A college degree offers a pathway to economic mobility for low-income students. Using a multi-site randomized controlled trial combined with administrative and survey data, we demonstrate that intensive advising during high school and college significantly increases bachelor’s degree attainment among lower-income students. We leverage unique data on pre-advising college preferences and causal forest methods to show that these gains are primarily driven by improvements in initial enrollment quality. Our results suggest that strategies targeting college choice may be a more effective and efficient means of increasing degree attainment than those focused solely on affordability.</content>

    <title>The Neoclassical Theory of Firm Investment and Taxes: A Reassessment</title>
    <updated>2025-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Gabriel Chodorow-Reich</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economists have widely varying opinions of how corporate taxation affects aggregate investment, output, and wages. This disagreement reflects a 60-year history of misapplication of the neoclassical theory of investment to interpret empirical work and guide policy analysis. In this article I reconsider the accumulated evidence relating tax policy to firm investment through the lens of the neoclassical theory. Empirical work suggests a range for the firm-level, short-run semi-elasticity of the investment-to-capital ratio to the user cost of -0.25 to -0.75. The mid-point of this range translates into values for the elasticity of firm revenue to capital of between 0.22 and 0.35. The implied general equilibrium, long-run elasticity of capital to the user cost can differ substantially from leading policy models. The elasticity of the wage to the user cost ranges from -0.3 to -0.7, or from -0.1 to -0.2 for changes to the user cost in the C-corporate sector alone. In the relatively low-tax regime in the U.S. in 2024, the neoclassical contribution to higher output from higher capital cannot rationalize more than modest dynamic tax revenue offsets from further reductions in corporate taxation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social desirability bias (SDB) is a pervasive threat to the validity of survey and experimental data. Respondents might often misreport sensitive attitudes and behaviors to appear more socially acceptable. We begin by synthesizing empirical evidence on the prevalence and magnitude of SDB across various domains, focusing on studies with individual-level benchmarks. We then critically assess commonly used strategies to mitigate SDB, highlighting how they can sometimes fail by creating confusion or inadvertently increasing perceived sensitivity. To help researchers navigate these challenges, we offer practical guidance on selecting the most suitable tools for different research contexts. Finally, we examine how SDB can distort treatment effects in experiments and discuss mitigation strategies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we discuss bequests and other intergenerational transfers and what impact they have on the consumption, saving, and labor supply behavior of households. We show that bequests and other intergenerational transfers are prevalent in most countries, that they are sometimes motivated by altruism and sometimes by selfishness, that they affect the consumption and saving behavior of households to some extent, especially that of elderly households, that they affect the labor supply behavior of households, especially that of bequest recipients, and that they have important policy implications.</content>

    <title>Scalable Targeting of Social Protection: When Do Algorithms Out-Perform Surveys and Community Knowledge?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Innovations in big data and algorithms are enabling new approaches to target interventions at scale. We compare the accuracy of three different systems for identifying the poor to receive benefit transfers — proxy means-testing, nominations from community members, and an algorithmic approach using machine learning to predict poverty using mobile phone usage behavior — and study how their cost-effectiveness varies with the scale and scope of the program. We collect mobile phone records from all major telecom operators in Bangladesh and conduct community-based wealth rankings and detailed consumption surveys of 5,000 households, to select the 22,000 poorest households for $300 transfers from 106,000 listed households. While proxy-means testing is most accurate, algorithmic targeting becomes more cost-effective for national-scale programs where large numbers of households have to be screened. We explore the external validity of these insights using survey data and mobile phone records data from Togo, and cross-country information on benefit transfer programs from the World Bank.</content>

    <title>Who Benefits from Paid Family Leave? The Impact on Informal and Formal Care for Middle-Aged and Older Adults with Disabilities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper analyzes the impact of paid family leave (PFL) policies on informal and formal care for middle-aged and older adults with disabilities in the U.S., and how the heterogeneous benefits accrue to different families. We use data from the 1998-2018 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and leverage the PFL programs implemented in California (2004), New Jersey (2009), and New York (2018) in a difference-in-differences (DiD) design. We deploy both the conventional two-way fixed effects (TWFE) model and an adapted DiD estimator developed by Sun and Abraham for staggered rollout designs. We find that PFL access is associated with a 5.7 percentage point increase in the likelihood that individuals with disabilities receive informal care from their children. We also show that PFL access significantly increases the use of home care services and nursing home care. These effects are primarily concentrated among individuals with disabilities who have both a spouse and children, and are almost non-existent among those who have only children and no spouse. Our findings demonstrate that PFL policies improve care access and help address unmet care needs for middle-aged and older adults with disabilities, but their impact remains limited for certain vulnerable subgroups, particularly those with only children.</content>

    <title>Nicotine Vaping and Youth Mental Health: New Evidence from E-Cigarette Regulations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The confluence of a youth mental health crisis and high rates of teenage nicotine vaping has led some U.S. tobacco control advocates to argue that reducing access to electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) — through policies such as ENDS taxation — may improve youth and young adult mental health. Using data from several nationally representative surveys (Youth Risk Behavior Survey, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health) and a generalized difference-in-differences approach, we find no evidence that ENDS taxation improves youth and young adult mental health. With 95 percent confidence, we can rule out that the mean state ENDS tax increase adopted during our analysis sample ($0.34 per mL of e-liquid in 2023$) reduces persistent depressive symptoms among youths by more than 0.3 percent and suicide ideation by more than 1.0 percent. Moreover, discrete-time hazard models provide little evidence that ENDS taxes affect dynamics in youth mental health. A similar pattern of results emerges when we examine a wider set of ENDS regulations, including minimum legal purchasing ages, e-cigarette licensure laws, online sales restrictions, and restrictions on indoor nicotine vaping.</content>

    <title>Firm Investment and the User Cost of Capital: New U.S. Corporate Tax Reform Evidence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) marked the first time in three decades that material changes were made to the corporate tax code of the United States. We use TCJA as a quasi natural experiment to estimate the impact of changes in user cost of capital on investment. Following the method of Auerbach and Hassett (1991), using cross-sectional data we find that the user cost is associated with higher rates of investment consistent with previous studies. BEA asset types with greater reductions in user cost of capital and marginal effective tax rate (METR) after the 2017 TCJA had greater statistically significant increases in their investment rates several years after the tax reform. Specifically, we find the magnitude of a 1 percentage point decrease in user cost is associated with a 1.68 to 3.05 percentage point increase in the rate of investment, larger than prior estimates of the responsiveness of investment with respect to user cost of capital.</content>

    <title>Childless or Child-fewer? Childlessness and Parity Progression where Fertility is Below Replacement</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Birth rates are falling worldwide, in every region. Falling birth rates can be decomposed into two components: (1) an increase in childlessness (i.e., lifetime nulliparity), and (2) fewer children ever born to women who have at least one child (completed cohort fertility among the parous). This paper quantifies the contributions of these two components for women in advanced economies in Europe, North and South America, and southeast Asia, and for recent cohorts in Indian districts. In both samples, we find that the birth rate among parous women is an important component in explaining low overall birth rates. Childlessness explains only 38% of the decline in cohort fertility in the advanced economies in our analysis. In the Indian context, childlessness accounts for only 6% of the difference between high-fertility and below-replacement districts. Moreover, in many country-cohorts and Indian districts, average completed cohort fertility would be below the replacement threshold even when considering only women who do have children—that is, omitting the zeros from the average. This is in tension with widespread recent narratives that attribute falling birth rates to increasing childlessness: To the contrary, in many populations average birth rates even among parents would be low enough eventually to cause depopulation.</content>

    <title>Efficiency in Job-Ladder Models</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the efficiency of a decentralized equilibrium in a broad class of random-search job-ladder models. We decompose the source of inefficiency into two margins: (i) the investment margin, that is, the difference between the private and social benefit of job creation given the surplus of a match, and (ii) the valuation margin, that is, the difference between the private valuation and the social valuation of a match surplus. In the presence of on-the-job searches, the well-known Hosios condition no longer guarantees the market equilibrium aligns with the efficient allocation along both margins. On-the-job searches contribute to the overvaluation of the match surplus in market equilibrium, especially at the top of the job ladder. Consequently, the decentralized equilibrium with the Hosios condition features excess creation of vacancies in the steady state. On-the-job searches also lead to excess volatility in unemployment in response to aggregate productivity shocks. Quantitatively, we find a significant difference between the equilibrium outcome and the efficient allocation under standard calibration. We also consider several decentralizations of the efficient allocation to shed light on the optimal policies under the frictional labor market.</content>

    <title>‘Sorting’ Out Gender Discrimination and Disadvantage: Evidence from Student Evaluations of Teaching</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How should gender discrimination and systemic disadvantage be addressed when more discriminatory and less generous students systematically sort into certain fields, courses, and instructors’ sections? In this paper, we estimate measures of gender bias and evaluation generosity at the student level by examining the gap between how a student rates male and female instructors, controlling for professor fixed effects. Accounting for measurement error, we find significant variation in gender bias and generosity across students. Furthermore, we uncover that bias varies systematically by gender and field of study and that patterns of sorting are sufficiently large to place female faculty at a substantive disadvantage in some fields and male faculty at a disadvantage in others. Finally, we document that sexist attitudes are predictive of gender-based sorting and propose Empirical Bayes inspired measures of student-level bias to correct for instructor-specific advantages and disadvantages caused by sorting.</content>

    <title>Wildfire, Smoke and Mental Health in Canada</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the relationship between wildfires and mental health-related hospitalizations in Canada from 2006 to 2018. Most previous estimates of the mental health costs of wildfire have focused on the impacts of exposure to PM₂.₅. We break new ground by highlighting other pathways for wildfires to affect mental health, including evacuation orders, direct local costs of fires, and climate anxiety, which is proxied using wildfire-related Twitter activity. We find that all these mechanisms affect mental health-related hospitalizations, with especially large impacts on hospitalizations for anxiety and substance abuse. Conditional on air quality, wildfire events that draw national attention worsen the mental health of susceptible people, even when they live far away. Elderly people and those with pre-existing health conditions that make them more vulnerable, are more strongly affected. The results indicate that climate anxiety stoked by wildfire events may account for much of the overall mental health cost. Accounting for these additional mechanisms does little to diminish the estimated effect of PM ₂.₅ from wildfire smoke, however, suggesting that the additional factors have effects on mental health that are in addition to those of PM₂.₅.</content>

    <title>How Does Privacy Regulation Affect Transatlantic Venture Investment? Evidence from GDPR</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how the GDPR affected transatlantic venture investment. Using investment data from 2014 to 2019, we find that the GDPR’s rollout in May 2018 led to a significant decline in US investor activity in the EU, evidenced by fewer deals and investment, especially for newer and data-related ventures. Investors shifted toward geographically closer ventures and relied more on syndication, particularly with EU-based lead investors. While the shift to local investing drove the overall decline, syndication partially offset it. The results highlight the role of digital policies in shaping investment strategies and influencing transatlantic capital flows.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building on recent advances in the literature on knowledge creation and innovation (notably Carnehl and Schneider (2025), we propose a novel general equilibrium model that explicitly incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) as a decision-enhancing technology capable of interpolating between known points of knowledge. Our framework formalises the trade-off between AI’s coverage— its ability to span wider knowledge gaps—and its accuracy, and reveals the surprising result that, beyond producing immediate productivity gains, AI fundamentally alters the novelty of research. Specifically, when AI systems offer sufficiently broad coverage, they incentivise exploratory research that taps into novel, distant areas of knowledge and accelerates long-run growth; conversely, limited coverage promotes incremental research that may boost short-term efficiency while dampening the overall advancement of new ideas. Moreover, our analysis uncovers that the type of knowledge—whether novel or dense—plays a critical role in determining both the growth and welfare implications of AI, charting a new path for understanding how knowledge influences research strategies. By also examining the roles of market structure, licensing arrangements, and regulatory frameworks, our work contributes new, policy-relevant insights that reconcile the immediate benefits of AI adoption with the demands of sustainable long-term economic expansion.</content>

    <title>Long-term Vertical Contracts, Geography, and the Persistence of Brand Shares</title>
    <updated>2025-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Previous research highlights persistent differences in national brand market shares across regions, driven by geographic consumer preferences and early entry advantages (Bronnenberg et al. 2007, 2009). This study investigates the extent to which long-term vertical contracts can explain the observed geographic dispersion and persistence of national brand dominance. Using NielsenIQ data from the same product categories as Bronnenberg et al. (2007), we follow Abowd et al. (1999) to decompose the variance in brand shares into Brand × Retailer and Brand × Market effects. Results show that 50% of the variance is explained by retailer effects, compared to 20% by market effects. This suggests that some retailers use vertical contracts that favor a specific brand across all markets in which they compete, such as exclusive-dealing, slotting allowances, or category-captaincy contracts, and that these play a key role in sustaining national brand dominance documented in prior literature. By emphasizing how retailer-specific factors drive observed patterns, we complement demand-side explanations and shift attention to supply-side factors that could affect competition.</content>

    <title>Abortion Restrictions and Intimate Partner Violence in the Dobbs Era</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In overturning Roe v. Wade and triggering laws in many states that ban or severely restrict abortions, the Supreme Court’s landmark 2022 Dobbs decision dramatically altered the landscape for reproductive health in the U.S. Prior research has highlighted the far-reaching impact of abortion restrictions for women and families, which extend beyond their proximate effects on abortions, births, and fertility. We provide some of the first causal evidence on how abortion restrictions in the post-Dobbs era have impacted women’s risk of exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV is the most common form of violence experienced by women, and changes in access to abortion may generate unintended effects on various inputs (economic resources, stress, intra-household bargaining) that could affect relationship dynamics and raise the risk of IPV. Leveraging information on IPV incidents reported to law enforcement from 2017-2023 combined with post-Dobbs changes in county-level travel distance to abortion facilities, analyses are based on a generalized difference-in-differences approach. We find that abortion restrictions – alternately measured by the increase in travel distance and by the presence of a near-total ban – significantly increased the rate of IPV for reproductive-aged women in treated counties on the order of about seven to 10 percent. These estimates imply at least 9,000 additional incidents of IPV among women in the treated “trigger ban” states, which would be predicted to add over $1.24 billion in social costs.</content>

    <title>The Longevity of Older Wives and Their Husbands: Comparing Actual Couples with Synthetic Couples</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), we construct two measures of the longevity of older wives and husbands. For definiteness, we focus on couples in which the wife was 60 and the husband 62 in 1988. Our first measure utilizes a 4 x 4 "longevity matrix" in which the bins correspond to the decades in which the spouses died. For example, an entry in the (3,2) bin indicates that the wife died in the 3rd decade (between ages 80 and 89) and the husband in the second decade (between ages 72 and 81). Our second measures use the Gompertz distribution to estimate the censored observations from the NHIS. We use the Gompertz estimates of age-specific mortalities to construct joint and survivor life expectancies for the couples in our working sample. We compare the longevity estimates based on actual couples from the NHIS with estimates based on synthetic couples constructed from the 1988 CDC life tables. Research based on randomly formed synthetic couples constructed from CDC life table data shows that the randomness of mortality and the overlap between spouses' age-specific mortality distributions imply dramatically long life spans for surviving spouses. The 4 x 4 longevity matrices show that longevity effects are magnified at the level of the couple by assortative marriage.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When job tasks are automated, does this augment or diminish the value of labor in the tasks that remain? We argue the answer depends on whether removing tasks raises or reduces the expertise required for remaining non-automated tasks. Since the same task may be relatively expert in one occupation and inexpert in another, automation can simultaneously replace experts in some occupations while augmenting expertise in others. We propose a conceptual model of occupational task bundling that predicts that changing occupational expertise requirements have countervailing wage and employment effects: automation that decreases expertise requirements reduces wages but permits the entry of less expert workers; automation that raises requirements raises wages but reduces the set of qualified workers. We develop a novel, content-agnostic method for measuring job task expertise, and we use it to quantify changes in occupational expertise demands over four decades attributable to job task removal and addition. We document that automation has raised wages and reduced employment in occupations where it eliminated inexpert tasks, but lowered wages and increased employment in occupations where it eliminated expert tasks. These effects are distinct from—and in the case of employment, opposite to—the effects of changing task quantities. The expertise framework resolves the puzzle of why routine task automation has lowered employment but often raised wages in routine task-intensive occupations. It provides a general tool for analyzing how task automation and new task creation reshape the scarcity value of human expertise within and across occupations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show long-term Treasury convenience yields are more sensitive to changes in Treasury supply than short-term Treasury convenience yields. The fiscal expansion in the past two decades and the resultant increase in Treasury supply depressed convenience yields heterogeneously across maturities — driving them close to zero for short-term Treasurys and into negative territory for long-term Treasurys. As a result, the aggregate seigniorage revenue earned by the U.S. from issuing safe and liquid financial assets has declined by a third. Issuing only short-term Treasurys could preserve the seigniorage revenue earned from Treasury convenience yields but would expose the government to more rollover risk.</content>

    <title>Controlling Collective Attention: Flooding versus Focusing by Politicians</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a model of strategic information provision where politicians choose how to allocate limited disclosure across multiple policy dimensions. Citizens are heterogeneous statistical learners who interpret data differently, following Liang (2021). Our key insight: spreading information thinly across many dimensions (“flooding the zone”) maximizes disagreement among citizens, preventing the coordination needed for collective accountability. We characterize equilibrium disclosure strategies and show that politicians with unfavorable private information flood to prevent investigation, while those with favorable information choose intermediate disclosure levels that balance reputation building with enabling scrutiny. The model yields both pooling equilibria that create “transparency theater”—where all politicians provide vast but shallow information—and separating equilibria where disclosure strategies reveal type. We derive threshold conditions showing that flooding dominates when investigation stakes are asymmetric, communication technology enables high dimensionality, and citizen populations are heterogeneous in their information processing. Extensions examine strategic interactions between competing politicians and the mediating role of information platforms in either amplifying or constraining flooding strategies.</content>

    <title>Is Less Really More? Comparing the Climate and Productivity Impacts of a Shrinking Population</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A smaller human population would emit less carbon, other things equal, but how large is the effect? Here we test the widely-shared view that an important benefit of the ongoing, global decline in fertility will be reductions in long-run temperatures. We contrast a baseline of global depopulation (the most likely future) with a counterfactual in which the world population continues to grow for two more centuries. Although the two population paths differ by billions of people in 2200, we find that the implied temperatures would differ by less than one tenth of a degree C—far too small to impact climate goals. Timing drives the result. Depopulation is coming within the 21st century, but not for decades. Fertility shifts take generations to meaningfully change population size, by which time per capita emissions are projected to have significantly declined, even under pessimistic policy assumptions. Meanwhile, a smaller population slows the non-rival innovation that powers improvements in long-run productivity and living standards, an effect we estimate to be quantitatively important. Once the possibility of large-scale net-negative emissions is accounted for, even the sign of the population-temperature link becomes ambiguous. Humans cause greenhouse gas emissions, but human depopulation, starting in a few decades, will not meet today’s climate challenges.</content>

    <title>The Labor Supply Curve is Upward Sloping: The Effects of Immigrant-Induced Demand Shocks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What is the effect of immigration on native labor-market outcomes? An extensive literature identifies the differential impact of immigration on natives employed in jobs that are more exposed to immigrant labor (supply exposure). But immigrants consume in addition to producing output. Despite this, no literature identifies the impact on natives employed in jobs that are more exposed to immigrant consumption (demand exposure). We study native labor-market effects of supply and demand exposures to immigration. Theoretically, we formalize both measures of exposure and solve for their effects on native wages. Empirically, we combine employer-employee data with a newly collected dataset covering electronic payments for the universe of residents in Norway to measure supply and demand exposures of all native workers to immigration induced by EU expansions in 2004 and 2007. We find large, positive, and persistent effects of demand exposure to EU expansion on native worker income.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Macro shocks produce high dispersion in firm-level equity returns, sales growth, and other outcomes. We show that this dispersion reflects observable differences in business characteristics. To do so, we combine firm-level returns on stock market ``jump" days with text about business risks in prior 10-K filings to construct firm-specific shock exposures. Our exposure measures explain firm-level abnormal returns through interpretable variation in language. They also explain most of the increased dispersion in firm-level revenue growth after major shocks and much of the dispersion in employment growth, investment rates, and earnings surprises. Our evidence yields a novel interpretation for countercyclical dispersion, highlighting the key role of heterogeneous business characteristics in macro shock transmission.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this chapter we survey recent advances in modeling cultural transmission in the economics literature. We first present the basic canonical model of the evolution of cultural traits in the social sciences. Both Economics and Evolutionary anthropology build on this canonical model but their approaches are conceptually very different. After elucidating these differences, we introduce several recent economic models of cultural transmission which address a rich set of novel and interesting questions in the literature. We present these models as extensions of the canonical framework, organized along theoretical dimensions that we categorize as pertaining to preferences and technology. We finally briefly discuss how cultural evolution represents a fundamental component - alongside institutional change - of recent theoretical work on the political economy of long-run growth. We conclude suggesting interesting areas for future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We advance the proxy variable approach to production function estimation. We show that the invertibility assumption at its heart is testable. We characterize what goes wrong if invertibility fails and what can still be done. We show that rethinking how the estimation procedure is implemented either eliminates or mitigates the bias that arises if invertibility fails. Furthermore, we show how a modification of the procedure ensures Neyman orthogonality, enhancing efficiency and robustness by rendering the asymptotic distribution of the GMM estimator in the second step of the estimation procedure invariant to estimation noise from the first step.</content>

    <title>Group Health Insurance Versus ACA Marketplaces: Selection, Subsidies, and Welfare</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Affordable Care Act (ACA) changed incentives for individual and employer-sponsored insurance. Using unique small group market (SGM) data with detailed claims and enrollment information, we analyze the welfare gains across households in the SGM from alternative formulations of ACA health insurance exchanges (HIXs). Accounting for observable heterogeneity increases estimated demand elasticities. Shutting down the SGM would reduce equilibrium adverse selection in HIX-type markets, increasing welfare for households moved to HIXs by $842 annually. The majority of households would obtain higher equilibrium welfare from HIXs, stemming from having more choices. Adding the 2014 ACA penalties only modestly decreases adverse selection.</content>

    <title>Medical School Closures, Market Adjustment, and Mortality in the Flexner Report Era</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Early twentieth century efforts to overhaul the quality of medical education in the United States (principally between 1905 and 1915 – the “Flexner Report Era”) led to a steep decline in the number of medical schools and medical school graduates. In this paper, we examine the consequences of these medical school closures be- tween 1900 and 1930 for county-level physicians, nurses, and midwives per capita as well as for infant, non-infant, and total mortality. To do so, we construct a school closure intensity measure for all counties in the United States, combining variation in (i) distance from closures, (ii) the historical number of graduates from closing schools, and (iii) the timing of closures. Nearby medical school closures (within 300 miles) led to a 4% reduction in physicians per capita, even after physician market adjustment through physician migration and postponed retirement. Strikingly, we find that medical school closures led infant mortality rates to decline by 8% and non- infant mortality rates to decline by 4%, suggesting that reducing the supply of poorly trained physicians may have reduced mortality.</content>

    <title>Cosmetology Gets a Trim: The Impact of Reducing Licensing Hours on Colleges and Students</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the United States, licenses are required for entry into many different occupations. Requirements vary by state and occupation, but many licenses require a minimum number of training or instructional hours. We consider the impact of these hours requirements on students and postsecondary institutions, with a particular focus on cosmetology (also known as hairstyling or beauty). Cosmetology licensing requires extensive training hours (between 500 and 2,100 hours) in every state and typically exceeds the time required for similar licenses. We implement a difference-in-difference design based on state-level changes in required licensing hours for cosmetologists between 2011 and 2019. We ask how and whether changes to hours requirements influence student outcomes and institutional behavior. We find that lowering required hours is likely beneficial for students, as it raises completion, lowers tuition, and expands enrollment among some groups of students. Larger institutions appear to reduce their tuition by less than smaller institutions. We find no detectable effects on the earnings of cosmetologists.</content>

    <title>Health Insurance Protections and Ex Ante Moral Hazard in Risky Health Behaviors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the goal of lowering incentives for alcohol and substance abuse, U.S. states have historically permitted private health insurers to deny reimbursement of medical claims stemming from alcohol or opioid impairment. However, a potential unintended consequence of such “exclusion provisions” is that they may reduce providers’ incentives to screen patients for alcohol intoxication and substance abuse, leading to an increase in risky health behaviors that carry substantial externality costs.  In response to these concerns, 16 states and the District of Columbia repealed their exclusion provisions and replaced them with explicit prohibitions on the denial of health insurance claims resulting from alcohol and other substance use impairment (PDHIAs). This study is the first to comprehensively explore the effects of PDHIAs on alcohol- and drug- related outcomes, with a particular focus on externalities associated with these risky health behaviors, allowing us to broadly assess their potential welfare effects. Leveraging a variety of national data sources (Uniform Crime Reports, Fatality Analysis Reporting System, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Treatment Episode Data Set, and Medical Expenditure Panel Survey) in conjunction with a generalized difference-in-differences approach, we find little support for the hypothesis that PDHIAs generated ex ante moral hazard. To the contrary, there is some evidence that PDHIAs may have reduced some criminal arrests, drunk driving behaviors, and alcohol use. One explanation for these findings is that physicians may be more willing to refer treatment services for substance use-related health issues when patients and hospitals are not financially penalized by PDHIAs. Lastly, there is little evidence that PDHIAs had broader impacts on private insurance markets, either in affecting private health insurance coverage or average premiums.</content>

    <title>Transition to Green Technology along the Supply Chain</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze a model of green technological transition along a supply chain. The model generates a unique equilibrium for given initial conditions but multiple steady-states. We show that: (i) even in the presence of Pigouvian environmental taxation, targeted sectoral subsidies are generally necessary to implement the social optimum; (ii) small, targeted industrial policy may bring large welfare gains; (iii) a government which is unable to subsidize greenification in more than one sector or price carbon at its true social cost should primarily target downstream sectors; (iv) over-investing in greenification in the wrong upstream branch may derail the overall transition towards greenification. Finally, we calibrate our model to decarbonization of heavy duty transportation (trucking, aviation, etc.) via hydrogen. We find that, absent industrial policy, the economy can get stuck in the “wrong” steady-state with CO₂ emissions vastly above the social optimum even with a Pigouvian carbon price in place.</content>

    <title>Designing Human-AI Collaboration: A Sufficient-Statistic Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a sufficient statistic for designing AI information-disclosure and selective automation policies. The approach allows for endogenous and biased beliefs, and effort crowd-out, without using a structural model of human decision-making. We deploy and validate our approach in a fact-checking experiment. Humans under-respond to AI predictions and reduce effort when presented with confident AI predictions. Overconfidence in own-signal rather than under-confidence in AI drives AI under-response.  The optimal policy automates decisions where the AI is confident and delegates the other decisions while fully disclosing the AI prediction. Although automation is valuable, the benefit of assisting humans with AI is negligible.</content>

    <title>How Does Wage Inequality Affect the Labor Movement?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides causal evidence on how wage inequality among workers affects the labor movement using three complementary research designs: a vignette experiment with union organizers, a natural policy experiment that increased wage inequality among Wisconsin school teachers, and an information intervention during the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike. Across all studies, we find that inequality undermines union strength through multiple channels. First, workers with high individual bargaining power are more likely to withdraw support in unequal environments, preferring individual over collective bargaining. Second, union organizers strategically respond to inequality in ways that may preserve membership but limit redistribution, such as shifting their campaign away from wages and choosing smaller, more homogeneous bargaining units. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential for “inequality traps,” where rising inequality erodes the very institutions designed to counteract it.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Culture shapes how policies are made and how people react to them. This chapter explores how culture and development policy affect each other. First, we provide evidence that cultural mismatch — specifically a mismatch between project manager background and the location of project implementation — is associated with the reduced success of World Bank projects. Second, drawing on historical and ethnographic work, we show that disregarding local cultural norms can undermine well-intentioned development policies. Third, we review economic research demonstrating that cultural practices systematically shape policy effectiveness, often leading to heterogeneous or unintended effects. Fourth, we discuss evidence that policies themselves can reshape cultural norms, sometimes in unexpected ways. Finally, we discuss research on tailoring interventions to the local context and conclude with lessons for future research.</content>

    <title>Quantifying Racial Disparities Using Consecutive Employment Spells</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops a framework to quantify racial disparities in earnings and employment that are not plausibly due to differences in productivity.  Over an employment cycle, employers learn about worker productivity and workers move to more productive and less prejudiced employers.  I use implications of this behavior to match high-tenure Black and white workers on unobservables.  I look at matched pairs who lose their jobs in a mass layoff.  Gaps in earnings and separations between these workers in their next jobs are not plausibly due to differences in productivity. Using U.S. data, earnings differences between these matched workers are five log points, about a quarter of the racial earnings gap among high-tenure workers.  Similarly, matched Black workers are more likely to separate.</content>

    <title>Financing the Next VC-Backed Startup: The Role of Gender</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What is the role of gender in the serial founding of VC-backed startups? Despite robust evidence linking serial entrepreneurship to startup success, women comprise 13.3% of VC-backed founders but only 4% of those founding three or more startups. Using a novel design comparing men and women cofounders of the same startup, we estimate substantial gender gaps in subsequent funding outcomes on average and following failure or success of the current startup. We find these at both the extensive and intensive margins. For example, following failure, women are 22.5% less likely to found another VC-backed startup compared to their cofounders who are men. Among those who do found another VC-backed firm, women raise 53.3% less capital following failure of the current venture and 24.6% less capital following success. These gaps contribute to the well-documented gender gap in VC funding. Lower interest of women in founding new firms can only partially explain our findings. We find no evidence of gender differences in founder quality or of statistical updating by investors. Instead, consistent with unequal treatment of women, we find that women serial founders are penalized with smaller VC deals following failures of their prior startups but they are not rewarded with larger deal sizes following past successes. By contrast, men are rewarded for their prior experiences as founders, regardless of whether their startups were failures or successes. In line with theories of stereotyping and confirmation bias, we also find striking negative spillovers from unrelated women-founded failures within investors’ portfolios (and no positive spillovers from their successes).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using newly-collected data on the near-population of U.S. STEM PhD graduates since 1950, we examine who funds PhD training, how many graduates are trained in areas of strategic national importance, and the effects of public investment in PhD training on the scientific workforce. The U.S. federal government is by far the largest source of financial and in-kind support for STEM PhD training in America. We identify universities and fields where PhD training has a higher or lower intensity of government, industry, or philanthropic support, and the organizations and universities that fund and train the most PhDs in critical technology areas such as AI, quantum information technology, and biotechnology. Leveraging variation in government support across agencies and over time, we provide evidence suggesting that increasing government-funded PhD trainees increases PhD production roughly one-for-one. To support further research, we provide public datasets at multiple levels of aggregation, reporting PhD graduates by (i) critical technology area and (ii) source of support.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Timely business-level measures of work from home (WFH) are scarce for the U.S. economy. We review prior survey-based efforts to quantify the incidence and character of WFH and describe new questions that we developed and fielded for the Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS). Drawing on more than 150,000 firm-level responses to the BTOS, we obtain four main findings. First, nearly a third of businesses have employees who work from home, with tremendous variation across sectors. The share of businesses with WFH employees is nearly ten times larger in the Information sector than in Accommodation and Food Services. Second, employees work from home about 1 day per week, on average, and businesses expect similar WFH levels in five years. Third, feasibility aside, businesses’ largest concern with WFH relates to productivity. Seven percent of businesses find that onsite work is more productive, while two percent find that WFH is more productive. Fourth, there is a low level of tracking and monitoring of WFH activities, with 70% of firms reporting they do not track employee days in the office and 75% reporting they do not monitor employees when they work from home. These lessons serve as a starting point for enhancing WFH-related content in the American Community Survey and other household surveys.</content>

    <title>Moment Restrictions for Nonlinear Panel Data Models with Feedback</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many panel data methods, while allowing for general dependence between covariates and time-invariant agent-specific heterogeneity, place strong a priori restrictions on feedback: how past outcomes, covariates, and heterogeneity map into future covariate levels. Ruling out feedback entirely, as often occurs in practice, is unattractive in many dynamic economic settings. We provide a general characterization of all feedback and heterogeneity robust (FHR) moment conditions for nonlinear panel data models and present constructive methods to derive feasible moment-based estimators for specific models. We also use our moment characterization to compute semiparametric efficiency bounds, allowing for a quantification of the information loss associated with accommodating feedback, as well as providing insight into how to construct estimators with good efficiency properties in practice. Our results apply both to the finite dimensional parameter indexing the parametric part of the model as well as to estimands that involve averages over the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity. We illustrate our methods by providing a complete characterization of all FHR moment functions in the multi-spell mixed proportional hazards model. We compute efficient moment functions for both model parameters and average effects in this setting.</content>

    <title>Common Ownership Around the World</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study common ownership in 49 countries from 2005 to 2019 and show that it is pervasive and rising around the world. However, despite this global growth, common ownership is still considerably lower in all countries compared to the United States. It is particularly high and growing rapidly among the largest firms, a trend observed across all countries and regions. The rise of common ownership stems not only from increased institutional investment but also from its growing concentration, a development in which the Big Three (BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street) play a dominant role, particularly in the United States. Although non-Big Three institutional investors remain important in other countries, the significant increase in common ownership in many countries is primarily attributable to the breadth, size, and growth of Big Three holdings. We also investigate how common ownership is related to legal, institutional, and market characteristics such as investor protection laws, competition laws, mandatory ESG disclosure, and labor market frictions across firms and countries.</content>

    <title>Foreign Political Risk and Technological Change</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how innovation reacts to foreign political risk and shapes its economic consequences. In a model with foreign political shocks that can disrupt the supply of foreign inputs, we show that greater political risk abroad increases domestic innovation, thereby lowering reliance on risky sourcing countries. We then combine data on sector-level technology development with time-varying measures of industry-level exposure to foreign political risk and report three sets of empirical findings. First, sectors and commodities with higher exposure to foreign political risk exhibit significantly greater innovative activity. This finding holds across sectors in the US, across country-sector pairs in a global sample, and across critical minerals that are essential for modern economic activity. Second, the response of innovation is particularly strong when risk emanates from geopolitical adversaries. This is consistent with our finding that trade restrictions are more likely to emerge between non-allies following a rise in political risk in either country. Third, directed innovation reduces countries’ reliance on imports from risky foreign markets. In doing so, technological change amplifies the negative effects of domestic political risk on export performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Inspired by the Silicon Valley Bank run and building on Diamond- Dybvig (1993), we develop a model in which asset price fluctuations can trigger bank runs. Liquidation amounts to selling assets at their market price. Depositors can buy and hold the assets after paying an idiosyncratic cost. We characterize the equilibria. We introduce a withdrawal pressure function to distinguish between fundamental runs, driven by market price declines, and self-enforcing runs triggered by depositor panic. Deposit insurance can prevent self-enforcing runs but incurs losses during fundamental runs. Regulatory measures ensuring price resilience reduce run risks, but at the expense of depositor welfare.</content>

    <title>Uncertainty through the Production Network: Sectoral Origins and Macroeconomic Implications</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how uncertainty propagates through production networks. First, we construct a highly disaggregated, forward-looking measure of industry-level uncertainty using option-implied volatility data for U.S. firms. Second, we identify the effects of higher uncertainty within industries, across the supply chain, and at the aggregate level. We find that heightened uncertainty in upstream industries (e.g., chemical manufacturing, iron and steel mills) behaves like a negative supply shock—raising prices and lowering employment across the production network. In contrast, greater uncertainty in downstream industries (e.g., automotive manufacturing, insurance carriers) behaves like an adverse demand shock, reducing both prices and employment. At the aggregate level, the inflation response depends on where uncertainty originates within the supply chain. A multi-sector model with time-varying sectoral uncertainty demonstrates that production linkages play a central role in explaining these empirical findings.</content>

    <title>Life Satisfaction in Western Europe and the Gradual Vanishing of the U-shape in Age</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using Eurobarometer data for 21 Western European countries since 1973 we show the U-shape in life satisfaction by age, present for so long, has now vanished.  In 13 northern European countries - Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK - the U-shape has been replaced by life satisfaction rising in age. We confirm these findings with evidence from the European Social Surveys, the Global Flourishing Survey and Global Minds.  Evidence of change in the U-shape is mixed for Austria and France. In six southern European countries – Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Malta, Spain and Portugal - the U-shape was replaced by life satisfaction declining in age.  In these southern European countries, life satisfaction of the young has been rising since around 2015.  A contributory factor is the rapid decline in youth unemployment from its 2015 peak.</content>

    <title>A Matter of Time? Measuring Effects of Public Schooling Expansions on Families</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage pronounced changes in the availability of public schooling for young children—through duration expansions to the kindergarten day—to better understand how an implicit childcare subsidy affects mothers and families. Exploiting full-day kindergarten variation across place and time from 1992 through 2022 and novel data on state-level policy changes, combined with a comparison of children of typical kindergarten age to older children, we measure effects on parental labor supply and family childcare expenses. Results suggest that families are responsive to these shifts. Full-day kindergarten expansions were responsible for as much as 24 percent of the growth in employment of mothers with kindergarten-aged children in this time frame.</content>

    <title>How the 1942 Japanese Exclusion Impacted U.S. Agriculture</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the early 1940s, Japanese American farmers represented a highly skilled segment of the agricultural workforce in the Western United States, characterized by higher education levels and more specialized farming expertise than U.S.-born farmers. During World War II, around 110,000 Japanese Americans (and 22,000 agricultural workers among them) were forcibly relocated from an “exclusion zone” along the West Coast to internment camps. Most never returned to farming.  Using county-level panel data from historical agricultural censuses and a triple-difference (DDD) estimation approach we find that, by 1960, counties in the exclusion zone experienced 12% lower cumulative growth in assessed farm value for each percentage point reduction of their 1940 share of Japanese farm workers, relative to counties outside the exclusion zone. These counties also lagged in farm revenues, adoption of high-value crops, mechanization, and adoption of commercial fertilizer. We present suggestive evidence of broader negative spillovers to local economic growth beyond the agricultural sector. Taken together, our findings highlight the long-run economic costs of this policy, illustrating how the loss of skilled farmers can reduce agricultural growth and, in a time of fast technological adoption, may have negative effects on the whole regional development.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The neoclassical economics of childbearing turns 65 this year, marking the anniversary of Gary Becker’s foundational article on the subject in 1960. This review article begins with a study of how childbearing has evolved in the United States over the last century, identifying distinctive features of the post-1960 era. Next, the article discusses standard neoclassical models of childbearing and shows how augmenting them with a supply side, which includes access to and information about contraception and abortion, increases their explanatory power. After reviewing recent quasi-experimental research testing this augmented model, the final part of the article reflects upon the implications of the recent transformation in US fertility rates for women and children and suggests fruitful avenues for future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We uncover a new real effect of harmonizing accounting standards on international trade: following a mandatory adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, exporters experiencing a greater change in reporting requirements become more successful in defending against foreign antidumping cases. The effect is also stronger with better reporting enforcement and is robust to excluding exporters from non-market economies. We discuss channels through which accounting-standards globalization facilitates efficient trade by either mitigating importing countries’ protectionism or curtailing exporters’ dumping activities.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a quantitative New Keynesian DSGE model with monopolistic banks to study the macroeconomic effects of introducing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Households benefit from an expansion of liquidity services and higher deposit rates as bank deposit market power is curtailed, while bank profitability and lending decline. We assess this trade-off for a wide range of economies that differ in their level of interest rates. We find substantial welfare gains from introducing a CBDC with an optimal rate that can be approximated by a simple rule of thumb: the maximum between 0% and the policy rate minus 1%.</content>

    <title>Mergers and Quality Provision in Healthcare: Evidence from Nursing Homes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper tests whether mergers between nursing home chains and independent facilities affect quality of care using facility-level data from 1999-2019. Staggered difference-in-differences estimates suggest that acquired facilities experience a 5% reduction in health deficiency citations 2 years post-merger. This improvement relies on the continuous supply of efficiency from chains; persists for four years; and is specific to mergers between chains and independent homes. Quality effects are driven by mergers involving smaller, higher-quality and non-private-equity-owned chains. A structural model suggests that the quality effect is generated by enhanced cost efficiency achieved by facilities serving larger numbers of residents after mergers.</content>

    <title>Private Equity and Workers: Modeling and Measuring Monopsony, Implicit Contracts, and Efficient Reallocation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We measure the real effects of private equity buyouts on worker outcomes by building a new database that links transactions to matched employer-employee data in the United States. To guide our empirical analysis, we derive testable implications from three theories in which private equity managers alter worker outcomes: (1) exertion of monopsony power in concentrated markets, (2) breach of implicit contracts with targeted groups of workers, including managers and top earners, and (3) efficient reallocation of workers across plants. We do not find any evidence that private equity-backed firms vary wages and employment based on local labor market power proxies. Wage losses are also very similar for managers and top earners. Instead, we find strong evidence that private equity managers downsize less productive plants relative to productive plants while simultaneously reallocating high-wage workers to more productive plants. We conclude that post-buyout employment and wage dynamics are consistent with professional investors providing incentives to increase productivity and monitor the companies in which they invest.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data on prescriptions for cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins), we study differences in the treatments chosen by Danish physicians for themselves versus for their patients. We estimate that physicians discount patient health benefit relative to their own, valuing the additional potency of a stronger statin by significantly more if it is for their own use. We exploit variation in expected coinsurance to estimate that moral hazard accounts for a modest share, no more than 15%, of this additional valuation. Statin-using physicians also respond more quickly to a patent expiration, suggesting greater effort to stay informed on drug classes they personally use.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An extensive experimental literature has documented miscoordination in establishing cooperative relationships when they can be supported in indefinitely repeated games: some people systematically try to cooperate, while others do not. The literature has had little success in finding personal characteristics that correlate systematically with these behaviors. We show that subjects who play the risky but efficient action in a simple coordination game (i.e., play stag in a stag hunt game) are significantly more likely to cooperate in indefinitely repeated games. This suggests that subjects who are less susceptible to strategic uncertainty are more likely to attempt to establish cooperative relationships.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cars have gotten bigger and faster yet more fuel efficient in recent decades. Why? We estimate an equilibrium model of car attribute production using U.S. household microdata for 1995–2017 and structurally decompose attribute trends into underlying mechanisms. We find that technical change led to gains in all attributes. Rising gas prices boosted efficiency but were offset by surging demand for size and acceleration. Efficiency standards were largely ineffective. We show that using technology alone to meet tighter standards quadruples compliance costs, while half the efficiency gain from a fuel-saving technology subsidy is reallocated to other attributes in equilibrium.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Higher compensation and increased monitoring are two common strategies for addressing the moral hazard problem between firms and workers. In a field experiment with new hires at an automobile manufacturing firm in China, we randomly varied both signing bonuses and monitoring intensity. Both interventions increased worker output but through different channels: signing bonuses led to longer working hours without significant gains in performance, while enhanced monitoring improved performance as evaluated by managers. Additionally, bonuses reduced quit rates, whereas monitoring raised them. These results suggest that firms should carefully consider their primary objectives and weigh these trade-offs when designing optimal labor contracts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Small businesses have long supplied a disproportionate share of major innovations in the United States. We review a centerpiece policy on this topic: the US Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. We trace its legislative history and summarize program evaluations over the past four decades. Using newly matched data on SBIR awards and venture capital investments into small businesses, we show that, despite often being compared to venture-backed businesses, SBIR-backed businesses pursue very different strategies. We use simple economic theories to motivate the SBIR program as a vehicle for the government to invest in small-scale, well-defined, but risky technologies that have large externalities, and we highlight a number of case studies consistent with this framework. Because the motivating friction lies at the level of ideas, our perspective encourages future evaluations to determine how the SBIR program influences not just who does the inventing, but what gets invented. Looking forward we discuss how rising industrial concentration and the diffusion of artificial intelligence may reshape the program’s comparative advantage in the innovation policy toolkit.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper analyzes 630,000 paintings from 1400 onward to uncover how visual art reflects its socioeconomic context. We develop a learning algorithm to predict nine basic emotions conveyed in each painting and isolate a context effect—the emotional signal shared across artworks created in the same location and year—controlling for artist, genre, and epoch-specific influences. These emotion distributions encode subtle but meaningful information about the living standards, uncertainty, or inequality characterizing the context in which the artworks were produced. We propose this emotion-based measure, derived from historical artworks, as a novel lens to examine how societies experienced major socioeconomic transformations, including climate variability, trade dynamics, technological change, shifts in knowledge production, and political transitions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the central role of firewood in the development of the early American economy, prices for this energy fuel are absent from official government statistics and the scholarly literature. This paper presents the most comprehensive dataset of firewood prices in the United States compiled to date, encompassing over 6,000 price quotes from 1700 to 2010. Between 1700 and 2010, real firewood prices increased by between 0.2% and 0.4%, annually, and from 1800 to the Civil War, real prices increased especially rapidly, between 0.7% and 1% per year. Rising firewood prices and falling coal prices led to the transition to coal as the primary energy fuel. Between 1860 and 1890, the income elasticity for firewood switched from 0.5 to -0.5. Beginning in the last decade of the 18th century, firewood output increased from about 18% of GDP to just under 30% of GDP in the 1830s. The value of firewood fell to less than 5% of GDP by the 1880s. Prior estimates of firewood output in the 19th century significantly underestimated its value. Finally, incorporating the new estimates of firewood output into agricultural production leads to higher estimates of agricultural productivity growth prior to 1860 than previously reported in the literature.</content>

    <title>The Political Economy of Stimulus Transfers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stimulus transfers are widely used during economic downturns, yet they are often poorly targeted from an economic perspective. I show that political incentives might help explain this discrepancy. I study one of the largest stimulus tax credits in Italy which excluded the poorest individuals and targeted middle-income earners. Leveraging quasi-random geographic variation in recipient shares and a difference-in-differences design, I find that the transfer raised the incumbent party’s vote share by 0.18 percentage points per 1 pp rise in recipients. These gains persist for at least five years. Political returns are stronger in areas with relatively richer beneficiaries, despite weaker consumption responses, and electoral punishment for exclusion is similarly asymmetric: higher-income excluded individuals reduce support for the incumbent, while poorer excluded individuals do not. Voters also punish incumbents when transfers are revoked, helping explain why temporary programs are rarely repealed. A counterfactual transfer targeting poorer households would have increased the consumption response by 30\% but reduced electoral returns by at least 15\%. These findings highlight a key political-economy trade-off in stimulus design, where electoral incentives skew transfers toward politically responsive recipients, as opposed to consumption responsive recipients.

    <title>The Power Asymmetry in Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Designs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) design, the probability of treatment jumps when a running variable (R) passes a threshold (R0). Fuzzy RD estimates are obtained via a procedure analogous to two-stage least squares (2SLS), where an indicator I(R &gt; R0) plays the role of the instrument. Recently, Keane and Neal (2023, 2024) showed that 2SLS t-tests suffer from a “power asymmetry”: 2SLS standard errors are spuriously small (large) when the 2SLS estimate is close to (far from) the OLS estimate. Here, we show that a similar problem arises in Fuzzy RD. Hence, if the endogeneity bias is positive, the Fuzzy RD t-test has little power to detect true negative effects, and inflated power to find false positives. The problem persists even if the instrument is very strong. To avoid this problem one should rely exclusively on the intent-to-treat (ITT) regression to assess significance of the treatment effect.</content>

    <title>A Stairway to Success: How Parenting Shapes Culture and Social Stratification</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter argues that parenting choices are a central force in the joint evolution of culture and economic outcomes. We present a framework in which parents-motivated by both their children’s future success and their own normative beliefs-choose parenting styles and transmit cultural traits responding to economic incentives. Values such as work ethic, patience, and religiosity are more likely to be instilled when their anticipated returns, economic or otherwise, are high. The interaction between parenting and economic conditions gives rise to endogenous cultural and economic stratification. We extend the model to include residential sorting and social interactions, showing how neighborhood choice reinforces disparities in trust and human capital. Empirical evidence from the World Values Survey supports the model’s key predictions. We conclude by highlighting open questions at the intersection of parenting, culture, and inequality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Econometricians invest substantial effort in constructing standard errors that yield valid inference under a hypothetical data-generating process. This paper asks a fundamental question: Are the uncertainty statements reported by applied researchers consistent with empirical frequencies? The short answer is no. Drawing on the forecasting literature, we predict estimates from “new” studies using estimates from corresponding baseline studies. By doing this across a large number of study groups and linking parameters through a hierarchical model, we compare stated probabilities to observed empirical frequencies. Alignment occurs only under limited external validity, namely, that the studies estimate different parameters.</content>

    <title>Immigration and Inequality in the Next Generation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the causal impacts of immigration to U.S. cities on the intergenerational economic mobility of children of U.S.-born parents. Immigration raises the educational attainment and earnings among individuals who grew up in poorer households and reduces the earnings, educational attainment, and employment among those who grew up in more affluent households. On net, immigration diminishes the link between parents' and their children's economic outcomes in the receiving population, and thus increases intergenerational mobility. The increase in mobility is strikingly similar in models estimated across cities and in within-city models that control for the trajectories of immigrant destinations.</content>

    <title>Borrowing Constraints, Markups, and Misallocation</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document new facts that link firms’ markups to borrowing constraints: (1) less constrained firms within an industry have higher markups, especially in industries where assets are difficult to borrow against and firms rely more on earnings to borrow; (2) markup dispersion is also higher in industries where firms rely more on earnings to borrow. We explain these relationships using a standard Kimball demand model augmented with borrowing against assets and earnings. The key mechanism is a two-way feedback between markups and borrowing constraints. First, less constrained firms charge higher markups, as looser constraints allow them to attain larger market shares. Second, higher markups relax borrowing constraints when firms rely on earnings to borrow, as those with higher markups have higher earnings. This two-way feedback lowers TFP losses from markup dispersion, particularly when firms rely on earnings to borrow.</content>

    <title>Net Worth Poverty in Childhood: How Duration and Timing Affect Educational Outcomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Very low household wealth, or net worth poverty (NWP), is the modal form of poverty for American children, yet little is understood about how it is experienced across childhood or its associations with children’s human capital accumulation. Using data from the 1999-2021 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics on a cohort of children followed from birth to age 20, this study examines the influence of NWP exposure and duration across a child’s life course on high school graduation and college attendance. Findings show that through age 18, children experienced more frequent and enduring spells of net worth poverty than income poverty. NWP was negatively associated with high school graduation and college attendance independent of the effects of income poverty. Effects were more pronounced for college attendance than for high school graduation, perhaps reflecting the resource-intensive nature of college. The negative effects of NWP were most pronounced for the 31% of the sample that was NWP for at least four waves. The timing of NWP relative to developmental stage did not seem to matter, as children were at risk regardless of the age at which they experienced net worth poverty.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using detailed product- and invention-level data from the pharmaceutical industry, we demonstrate that firms with particularly high-selling “blockbuster” products concentrate their development efforts on new products that both target the same customer segments and are more likely to be technically similar to existing blockbuster products. This behavior, driven by an expectation of the stickiness of demand for existing product offerings, limits firms' incentives to invest in entirely new products targeting different customer segments. Our findings offer insights into how blockbuster products shape firms' customer segment and innovation choices, with implications for understanding the dynamics of technological change in R&amp;D-intensive industries.</content>

    <title>The Net Benefits of Raising Bachelor’s Degree Completion through the City University of New York ACE Program</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In 2015, the City University of New York (CUNY) launched a new program— Accelerate, Complete, and Engage (ACE)—aimed at improving college graduation rates. A randomized-control evaluation of the program found a nearly 12 percentage point increase in graduation five years after college entry. Using this impact estimate and national data on earnings by gender, age, and degree status; we estimate incremental expected long-run benefits and costs for participants, as well as intergenerational effects for the children of participants, relative to “business as usual” for the control group. Our main estimate indicates net social benefits of more than $48,000 over a lifetime per participant from greater earnings and labor force attachment, improvements in health, and savings in public transfers. A major contribution of our analysis is the estimation of second-generational benefits. Including intergenerational benefits for children who grow up in newly higher-earning families nearly triples this estimate, to over $130,000 in net social benefits per participant. These results are sensitive to assumptions about whether the impact on graduation after five years persists indefinitely, or whether the control group eventually catches up. Still, net social benefits are strongly positive even under our most conservative assumptions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Monetary policy transmits through broad financial conditions—interest rates, asset prices, credit spreads and exchange rates—rather than through the policy rate alone. Yet current frameworks remain anchored around r*, the neutral interest rate. We introduce FCI*, the neutral level of financial conditions that closes expected output gaps, within a framework where financial conditions and macroeconomic shocks drive economic activity with inertia. Conceptually, FCI* reflects macroeconomic developments rather than financial market valuations, making it more stable than r*, which responds to both macroeconomic and financial factors. We estimate FCI* using a two-equation model along the lines of Laubach and Williams (2003) with 1990-2024 data. Our empirical estimates reveal three findings. First, estimated FCI* remained stable after the 2008 crisis while r* declined persistently due to asset price declines. Second, since the observed FCI reflects financial market shocks, large FCI gaps emerge especially during recessions. Third, at times of rapid monetary policy changes, FCI gaps more accurately reflect the effective policy stance because FCI is driven by forward-looking markets; for example, FCI gaps correctly identified the 2022 tightening when interest rate measures still suggested accommodation.</content>

    <title>The Revenue and Distributional Impacts of Unemployment Insurance Reform: Evidence from California</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the United States, unemployment insurance (UI) is funded through employer-side payroll taxes that are experience-rated based on previous UI claims. States differ significantly with respect to the financing of their programs, and a majority of state programs do not currently meet minimum UI trust fund solvency standards. A common culprit in the least solvent states is a very low tax base of earnings on which UI taxes are levied. We focus on California, the least solvent of the 50 state UI programs, with debt currently to the federal government of $21 billion, and which has the lowest base of taxable earnings at $7000 per year. We use matched employer-employee administrative data to estimate the impact of financing reforms to California’s UI system. We find that raising the taxable earnings base would replenish the state’s UI trust fund and would increase experience rating by reducing the number of systematically subsidized firms. While this improves vertical equity of the UI system, it would also worsen horizontal equity by imposing much larger percentage increases in tax costs on the firms with the fewest layoffs. Alternatively, matching the higher tax base with both higher maximum and lower minimum rates could improve both experience rating and horizontal equity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the economic impacts of one of the world's largest anti-corruption crackdowns, Brazil's Operação Lava Jato (Car Wash). Using a difference-in-differences analysis of unique, matched firm-bank data, we find sizable declines in employment and wage bills for investigated firms, alongside reduced access to credit. We also find adverse indirect effects through the bank credit channel, where highly exposed banks reduce credit to non-investigated firms, particularly for politically connected existing borrowers. Non-investigated firms exposed to the economic shock through their bank relationships suffer declines in wage bills and employment. The findings highlight the intricate economic implications of anti-corruption policies targeting large corporations.</content>

    <title>Effects of the Minimum Wage on Employment of Young Adults with Cognitive Disabilities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study analyzes, for the first time, the effect of increases in the minimum wage on the labor market outcomes of working age adults with cognitive disabilities, a vulnerable and low-skilled sector of the actual and potential labor pool. Using data from the American Community Survey (2008-2023), we estimated effects of the minimum wage on employment, labor force participation, weeks worked, and hours worked among working age individuals with cognitive disabilities using a generalized difference-in-differences research design. We found that a higher effective minimum wage leads to reduced employment and labor force participation among individuals with cognitive disabilities but has no significant effect on labor supply at the intensive margin for this group. Adverse impacts were particularly pronounced for those with lower educational attainment. In contrast, we found no significant labor market effects of an increase in the minimum wage for individuals with physical disabilities or in the non-disabled population.</content>

    <title>Why Is Fertility So Low in High Income Countries?</title>
    <updated>2025-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Melissa Schettini Kearney &amp; Phillip B. Levine</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper considers why fertility has fallen to historically low levels in virtually all high-income countries. Using cohort data, we document rising childlessness at all observed ages and falling completed fertility. This cohort perspective underscores the need to explain long-run shifts in fertility behavior. We review existing research and conclude that period-based explanations focused on short-term changes in income or prices cannot explain the widespread decline. Instead, the evidence points to a broad reordering of adult priorities with parenthood occupying a diminished role. We refer to this phenomenon as “shifting priorities” and propose that it likely reflects a complex mix of changing norms, evolving economic opportunities and constraints, and broader social and cultural forces. We review emerging evidence on all these factors. We conclude the paper with suggestions for future research and a brief discussion of policy implications.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Lab-in-the-field experiments, in which lab experiments are conducted in more naturalistic settings, are increasingly being implemented in developing country contexts. In this chapter, we outline the conceptual and logistical challenges typically associated with lab-in-the-field experiments in non-Western settings. We describe the importance of worldviews and how researcher preconceptions may inadvertently shape the types of research questions that are asked. We emphasize the importance of increasing diversity of subject pools and researchers. We also suggest a set of best practices when implementing lab-in-the-field experiments in developing countries.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Extensions in human longevity are prompting a growing interest in maximizing healthspan, or the number of years of life unencumbered by the chronic diseases of old age. This chapter reviews recent research on healthy life extension, including several measures and determinants of longer healthspans. We also provide an overview of recent efforts by medical and business enterprises to enhance longevity and healthspan, followed by a discussion of policy and workplace options to foster healthier lives. Such efforts hold the promise of improving quality of life, expanding labor supply, and lowering the cost of health care costs associated with population aging.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper analyzes the importance of doctor discretion in medical evaluations. Leveraging comprehensive administrative data and random assignment of doctors to evaluations in workers’ compensation insurance, we identify the scope for doctor discretion in medical evaluations of injured workers and the impacts of this discretion on later claimant outcomes. Our analysis indicates there is wide variation across doctors in medical evaluations, these decisions are consequential for later claimant outcomes, and doctor effects vary systematically by observed doctor characteristics. In addition, we analyze the relationship between doctor effects in medical evaluations and market allocation when claimants can select their own doctors. Our findings suggest both claimants and insurers influence the allocation of doctors in line with their respective incentives, indicating market forces shape the distribution of program benefits. Finally, we conclude with supplemental counterfactual analysis and discussion of the policy implications of these findings.</content>

    <title>Do Pensions Enhance Teacher Effort and Selective Retention?</title>
    <updated>2025-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Theoretical rationales for employer-provided pensions often focus on their ability to increase employee effort and selectively retain quality workers. We test these hypotheses using rich administrative data on public school teachers around the pension-eligibility threshold. When teachers cross the threshold, their effective compensation drops by over 50 percent of salary due to sharply reduced pension accrual rates. Standard economic models predict this compensation reduction should decrease teacher effort and output, yet we observe no such decline. This suggests that yearly pension accruals near retirement do not meaningfully increase effort. Similarly, if pensions selectively retained better teachers, we would expect average teacher quality to decline when the retentive incentive disappears at the threshold. Instead, we find no change in the composition of teacher quality, suggesting pensions do not selectively retain higher-performing workers in late career.</content>

    <title>Health Spillovers: The Broad Impact of Spousal Health Shocks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper we provide new evidence on the health spillover effects of health shocks within couples. Using administrative data from the Netherlands and a matching event-study framework, we estimate the causal effect of experiencing a health shock within a couple on the health of the initially unaffected partner. Our findings reveal a significant deterioration in the partner’s health outlook, characterized by substantial increases in hospital visits, overnight stays, and mortality. The health decline is broad in scope, encompassing higher risk of infections, accidents, and digestive and cardiovascular conditions. This deterioration is accompanied by substantial increases in stress, anxiety and depression for both men and women, as well as sleep disorders for women. These effects are not driven by a heavy caregiving load, financial distress or worsening of health behaviors. On the contrary, the adverse outcomes persist despite suggestive positive changes, including increased exercise for both men and women, and reduced alcohol consumption among women.</content>

    <title>What Do Market-Access Subsidies Do? Experimental Evidence from Tunisia</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many countries seek to promote exports by subsidizing market access, but evidence on such efforts has been mixed. We present the first randomized evaluation of a government financial-support program explicitly targeting exports, the Tasdir+ program in Tunisia. The program offered matching grants for fixed market-access costs but not variable costs. Tracking outcomes in administrative data, we find positive effects on exports on average. We find limited impacts on the number of destinations or exported products, which were stated policy targets. The finding that the fixed-cost subsidies expanded exports on the intensive margin but not the extensive margins of destinations or products stands in contrast to the predictions of several workhorse trade models.</content>

    <title>Out-of-School Learning: Subtitling vs. Dubbing and the Acquisition of Foreign-Language Skills</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The development of English-language skills, a near necessity in today’s global economy, is heavily influenced by historical national decisions about whether to subtitle or dub TV content. While prior studies of language acquisition have focused on schools, we show the overwhelming influence of out-of-school learning. We identify the causal effect of subtitling in a difference-in-differences specification that compares English to math skills in European countries that do and do not use subtitles. We find a large positive effect of subtitling on English-language skills of over one standard deviation. The effect is robust to accounting for linguistic similarity, economic incentives to learn English, and cultural protectiveness. Consistent with oral TV transmission, the effect is larger for listening and speaking skills than for reading.</content>

    <title>Basel Endgame: Bank Capital Requirements and the Future of International Standard Setting</title>
    <updated>2025-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In 2023, US regulators proposed the “Basel Endgame,” a long-awaited overhaul of bank capital requirements. The proposal aimed to bring the United States into compliance with international standards established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in response to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. However, fierce industry opposition to what banks viewed as a costly increase in capital requirements effectively killed the proposal. In this essay, we describe the purpose of bank capital and the history of international standard-setting in bank regulation. We then highlight the most important aspects of the Basel Endgame, as well as the arguments for and against adopting the rule. We show that the debate unnecessarily conflated two distinct questions: (1) whether the United States should comply with international regulatory standards, and (2) whether the United States should raise large banks’ capital requirements. While there are strong grounds to answer both questions in the affirmative, they need not be addressed together. That is, the United States can implement international standards in a capital-neutral manner to preserve global cooperation in bank regulation, leaving the separate question of raising capital requirements for another day.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do advanced technology adoption and venture capital (VC) funding impact employment and growth? An analysis of data from the US Census Bureau suggests that while both advanced technology use and VC funding matter on their own for firm outcomes, their joint presence is most strongly correlated with higher employment levels. VC presence is linked with a high increase in employment, though primarily among a limited subset of firms. In contrast, technology adoption is associated with a smaller rise in employment, yet it influences a considerably larger number of firms. A model of startups is created, focusing on decisions to use advanced technology and seek VC funding. The model is compared with firm-level data on employment, advanced technology use, and VC investment. Several thought experiments are conducted using the model. Some experiments assess the importance of advanced technology and VC in the economy. Others examine the reallocation effects across firms with different technology choices and funding sources in response to shifts in taxes and subsidies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how central banks can strategically integrate artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance their operations. Using a dual-framework approach, we demonstrate how AI can transform both strategic decision-making and daily operations within central banks, taking the Federal Reserve System (FRS) as a representative example. We first consider a top-down view, showing how AI can modernize key central banking functions. We then adopt a bottom-up approach focusing on the impact of generative AI on specific tasks and occupations within the Federal Reserve and find a significant potential for workforce augmentation and efficiency gains. We also address critical challenges associated with AI adoption, such as the need to upgrade data infrastructure and manage workforce transitions.</content>

    <title>Transitory and Permanent Import Tariff Shocks in the United States: An Empirical Investigation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate transitory and permanent import tariff shocks in the United States over the postwar period. We find that transitory tariff increases are neither inflationary nor contractionary, and are not associated with monetary tightening. In contrast, permanent tariff increases trigger a temporary rise in inflation (a one-off increase in the price level) and a brief tightening of monetary policy. Consistent with the intertemporal approach to the balance of payments, transitory tariff increases reduce imports and improve the trade balance, whereas permanent increases leave both largely unchanged. Transitory shocks account for approximately 80 percent of tariff movements. Overall, tariff shocks are estimated to be a minor driver of U.S. business cycle fluctuations on average and even during episodes of substantial tariff hikes, such as Nixon 1971, Ford 1975, and Trump 2018.</content>

    <title>Where Discovery Happens: Research Institutions and Fundamental Knowledge in the Life-Sciences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fundamental knowledge in the life sciences has consequential implications for medicine and subsequent medical innovations. Using publications in leading life science journals to measure fundamental knowledge, we document large agglomerations in the institutions where it is discovered and a robust correlation between knowledge and subsequent citations in patents. We assess whether the institution where research is produced affects the output of scientists by using a scientist-mover design, which compares annual research output before and after a move for the same scientist. Between 50 − 60% of a scientist’s research output is attributable to the institution where they work, and two thirds of this effect is driven by the presence of star researchers. The magnitude of these effects has not decreased in more recent time periods, in the wake of technologies that make cross-institution collaborations easier, nor is it larger for moves to larger agglomerations, nor concentrated in particular scientific fields. We discuss the implications of these findings for research allocations in science and scientists’ leaving one institution for another.</content>
