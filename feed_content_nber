    <title>Killer Congestion: Temperature, Healthcare Utilization and Patient Outcomes</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Extreme heat imperils health and results in more emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. Since temperature affects many individuals within a region simultaneously, these health impacts could lead to surges in healthcare demand that generate hospital congestion. Climate change will only exacerbate these challenges. In this paper, we provide the first estimates of the health impacts from extreme heat that unpacks the direct effects from the indirect ones that arise due to hospital congestion. Using data from Mexico’s largest healthcare subsystem, we find that ED visits rise by 7.5% and hospitalizations by 4% given daily maximum temperatures above 34◦C. As a result, more (and sicker) ED patients are discharged home, and deaths within the hospital increase. While some of those hospital deaths can be directly attributed to extreme heat, our analysis suggests that approximately over half of these excess deaths can be viewed as spillover impacts due to hospital congestion. Additional analyses also reveal an increase in the share of deaths occurring outside hospitals, consistent with congestion-related health harms arising from the discharge of sicker patients from the ED. Our findings highlight an important new avenue of adaptation to climate change. If hospital congestion contributes to excess health damages from a changing climate, then expanding labor and capital investments and improving surge management tools can help reduce those damages.</content>

    <title>Declining Life Satisfaction and Happiness Among Young Adults in Six English-speaking Countries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We report eleven studies that show declines in life satisfaction and happiness among young adults in the last decade or so, with less uniform trends among older adults. We found consistent evidence for this for the U.S. in the recent sweeps of several micro data sets including the Behavioral Risk Factor Survey, the General Social Survey, and the American National Election Survey.  In the U. S. life satisfaction rises with age. This is broadly confirmed in several other datasets including four from the European Commission across five other English-speaking countries: Australia, Canada, Ireland New Zealand and the UK. Declining wellbeing of the young was also found in the World Values Survey, the Global Flourishing Study and Global Minds. There is broad evidence across all of these English-speaking countries that happiness and life satisfaction since 2020 rise with age. In several of these surveys we also find that ill-being declines in age. The U-shape in wellbeing by age that used to exist in these countries is now gone, replaced by a crisis in wellbeing among the young.</content>

    <title>High-Speed Rail and China's Electric Vehicle Adoption Miracle</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using China's expansion of the high-speed rail system (HSR) as a quasi-natural experiment, we analyze the comprehensive vehicle registration data from 2010 to 2023 to estimate the causal impact of HSR connectivity on the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). Implementing several identification strategies, including staggered difference-in-differences (DID), Callaway and Sant'Anna (CS) DID, and two instrumental-variable approaches, we consistently find that, by alleviating range anxiety, the expansion of HSR can account for up to one third of the increase in EV market share and EV sales in China during our sample period, with effects particularly pronounced in cities served by faster HSR lines. The results remain robust when controlling for local industrial policies, charging infrastructure growth, supply-side factors, and economic development. We also find that HSR connectivity amplifies the effectiveness of charging infrastructure and consumer purchase subsidies in promoting EV adoption.</content>

    <title>Does Peer Review Penalize Scientific Risk Taking? Evidence from NIH Grant Renewals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scientific projects that carry a high degree of risk may be more likely to lead to breakthroughs yet also face challenges in winning the support necessary to be carried out. We analyze the determinants of renewal for more than 100,000 R01 grants from the National Institutes of Health between 1980 and 2015. We use four distinct proxies to measure risk taking: extreme tail outcomes, disruptiveness, pivoting from an investigator’s prior work, and standing out from the crowd in one’s field. After carefully controlling for investigator, grant, and institution characteristics, we measure the association between risk taking and grant renewal. Across each of these measures, we find that risky grants are renewed at markedly lower rates than less risky ones. We also provide evidence that the magnitude of the risk penalty is magnified for more novel areas of research and novice investigators, consistent with the academic community’s perception that current scientific institutions do not motivate exploratory research adequately.</content>

    <title>Guaranteed Employment in Rural India: Intra-Household Labor and Resource Allocation Consequences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I investigate the intra-household labor and resource allocation consequences of an employment guarantee targeting rural households in India. The guarantee insures household earnings, replacing women as added workers and shutting down a motive for saving. Despite sizable program-job take-up, the guarantee decreases participation in other working activities, and, thus, the labor force participation of married women and total time worked by their husbands. The guarantee accounts for up to 30% of a recent countrywide decrease in rural female labor force participation. Though it increases household consumption, the guarantee reduces the command of household earnings by women, and, thereby, their well-being.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We summarize recent methods to study optimal spatial policies. We center the discussion on policies that implement the optimal distribution of population in the presence of spatial spillovers, spatial transfers to optimally tackle redistribution between rich and poor regions, and optimal transportation investments.</content>

    <title>Policy Interventions and China’s Stock Market in the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;China’s stock market greatly outperformed other national markets during the first several months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it did so even before it became evident that early containment efforts would flounder in the United States and many other countries. As to why, one view holds that aggressive monetary and credit easing propped up Chinese equity values. To assess this view, we consider several interventions that eased monetary and credit conditions in the first six months of 2020. Our analysis finds clear evidence that these interventions raised implied stock market volatility but little evidence that they influenced stock price levels. We also consider policy actions that restricted short selling, limited stock sales, and boosted stock purchases. These efforts to raise net equity demand were small in scale and highly time-limited, as we discuss, suggesting that any direct effects on stock prices were also modest. Neither our study nor other work known to us provides a ready explanation for the extraordinary performance of China’s stock market in the first half of 2020. This performance is even more striking in hindsight, given later developments in China’s economy and stock market.</content>

    <title>Firm Trade Exposure, Labor Market Competition, and the Worker Incidence of Trade Shocks</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Jeronimo Carballo &amp; Richard K. Mansfield</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how the composition of firm exposure and competition among imperfectly substitutable workers mediate the earnings, welfare, and unemployment incidence of changes in the international trade environment. We merge LEHD job match records with firm-level import and export records from the LFTTD and use them to estimate a large-scale assignment model of the entire U.S. labor market.  The model flexibly accommodates frictions from switching regions, industries, trade engagement status, and even particular employers. We construct firm-level estimates of the employment impact of China's WTO entry using exogenous tariff gap variation via four different channels, import and export competition and import and export access, and combine them with the model to evaluate the shock's worker-level incidence.
Our results show that the firm composition of shock exposure does matter for medium-run worker-level earnings incidence, with workers at the highly exposed multinational manufacturing firms experiencing the largest shock-induced earnings losses.  However, labor market competition causes the shock's impact to spread to seemingly unaffected sectors and trickle down the skill ladder, so that entry-level non-traded service workers and initially unemployed job-seekers account for a large share of earnings losses and particularly unemployment increases.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce, analyze, and describe subnational data on cross-gender friendships for nearly 200 countries and territories, using data from 1.38 trillion ties between 1.8 billion Facebook users. Homophily by gender exists nearly everywhere, with individuals' strongest ties exhibiting less homophily than their peripheral connections. Across countries, cross-gender friendship rates align with existing measures of gender disparities. Within countries, cross-gender friending rates correlate with support for gender equality. In the US, cross-gender friendships are rarer in areas with a larger White share of the population, higher incomes, and more per-capita religious congregations.</content>

    <title>Economic Shocks and Healthcare Capital Investments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Information technology (IT) can enhance firms’ long-run performance but is also a risky investment, with high fixed costs and uncertain returns. Whether market events influence this tradeoff has received limited attention. We leverage the healthcare context to empirically examine hospitals’ IT investments following economic downturns and public insurance expansions––i.e., large industry shocks in opposite directions. We find novel and symmetrical responses. Recessions restrain investments while expansion policy indirectly stimulates them. Importantly, the IT margin is more elastic than other spending responses to market fluctuations. Supplementary analyses suggest that hospitals’ finances and perceptions of uncertainty drive these capital investment adjustments.</content>

    <title>The U.S. Place-Based Policy Supply Chain</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Place-based policy in the United States comprises a wide range of government programs that are spread across federal, state, and local agencies and that rely on public, private, and nonprofit organizations for policy design and implementation. We document how loosely connected vertical policy supply chains distribute resources from federal and state governments to recipients at the local level. The apparatus is the product of 150 years of policy innovation, both from the top down, with the federal government periodically launching major initiatives whose place-based impacts tend to be long-lived (even if the specific policies are not), and from the bottom up, with state and local actors engineering their own policy solutions, many of which have endured and now constitute modern policy practice. That practice includes not just tax incentives for business investment, the subject of most economic research on place-based policy, but support for community redevelopment, workforce development, small business promotion, technological innovation, and regional planning and strategy. Intermediary organizations that connect government agencies to local recipients are central to resource delivery. Because they tend to be created, funded, and (or) run by non-state actors, there appears to be wide geographic variation in organizational capacity for place-based policy. Understanding the causes and consequences of that variation is needed for a full accounting of how place-based policy works in the U.S.</content>

    <title>Long-Run Comparative Statics</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>David Baqaee &amp; Hannes Malmberg</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What are the long-run effects of permanent changes to the economy? We characterize long-run comparative statics for a broad class of models in terms of expenditure shares, substitution elasticities, and capital supply elasticities. Our key insight is that long-run analysis can be performed using an as-if static economy where capital is treated as an intermediate input subject to endogenous markups. These markups, which measure deviations from the Golden Rule of savings, equal the ratio of capital income to investment. This reframing yields a surprising result: long-run consumption responses follow standard second-best logic, even in efficient economies. In particular, reallocations have first-order effects since the envelope theorem does not apply. Furthermore, sales alone do not summarize industries’ importance for long-run consumption. To show how these points matter in practice, we develop a quantitative model of the world economy to study how markups, tariffs, and productivities affect long-run consumption. The model features input-output linkages, imperfectly elastic capital supply, heterogeneous returns, and endogenous net foreign asset positions. We find large negative first-order effects of tariffs and markups, even when initial tariffs and markups are zero. We also find that the productivities of industries upstream of investment goods have substantially larger long-run consumption effects than their sales shares would suggest.</content>

    <title>Misperceptions of Nonlinear Budget Sets: Evidence from Administrative Tax Data</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Budget set kinks are much studied in economics, including in the context of “bunching” estimators that assume individuals react to the true marginal tax rate. We document that individuals disproportionately “left-bunch” below kinks in the context of the Social Security Earnings Test where incentives from its actuarial adjustments should instead push many rational agents to bunch above the kink. We show that the left bunching in this case cannot be explained through standard, rational reactions to the incentives. We demonstrate that these patterns represent the first empirical evidence consistent with “spotlighting,” wherein individuals misperceive the local marginal tax rates as applying throughout the tax schedule and therefore treat the kink as a notch. In the context of the Earnings Test, this misperception provides an explanation for why literature has found large earnings responses despite the fact that the Earnings Test typically creates weak incentives for rational agents to adjust earnings. More generally, if individuals perceive kinks as notches, then elasticities estimated from bunching at kinks where this misperception may be at play may be significantly over-estimated.</content>

    <title>A Family Affair: The Effects of College on Parent and Student Finances</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Paying for college is often a family affair, with both parents and students contributing. We study the effects of college on family finances using administrative data on the universe of federal aid applicants in California linked to credit records. We provide the first comprehensive analysis of how both students and their parents use debt with college attendance and how prices affect those decisions. We start by using an event-study framework to explore how parents’ use of debt and credit outcomes change after their child first submits a federal aid application for college enrollment. While total debt does not change, higher-income parents shift balances from other debt to educational loans. We find that lower-income parents take out more education loans, experience less delinquency on non-educational debt, and see their credit scores rise. We then use discontinuities in eligibility for generous financial aid to test how an exogenous change in the price of college affects parental debt and financial health. We find that parents finance increases in the price of college through educational loans as well as home equity loans. Higher prices increase parental delinquency on debt. The findings highlight an important channel by which college and its rising cost may spill over into the broader financial health of families and economy.</content>

    <title>The Benefits from Bundling Demand in K-12 Broadband Procurement</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a new market design for K-12 school broadband procurement that switched from school-specific bidding to a system that bundled schools into groups. Using an event study approach, we estimate the program reduced internet prices by 37% per Mbps per month while increasing bandwidth by 500%. These benefits occurred by mitigating exposure risk in broadband procurement – the risk that providers win too few contracts to cover fixed infrastructure costs. Using a bounds approach, we show robustness of our estimates and document that participants saved at least as much as their federal subsidies and experienced substantial welfare gains.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage recent advances in NLP to construct measures of workers' task exposure to AI and machine learning technologies over the 2010 to 2023 period that vary across firms and time. Using a theoretical framework that allows for a labor-saving technology to affect worker productivity both directly and indirectly, we show that the impact on wage earnings and employment can be summarized by two statistics. First, labor demand decreases in the average exposure of workers' tasks to AI technologies; second, holding the average exposure constant, labor demand increases in the dispersion of task exposures to AI, as workers shift effort to tasks that are not displaced by AI. Exploiting exogenous variation in our measures based on pre-existing hiring practices across firms, we find empirical support for these predictions, together with a lower demand for skills affected by AI. Overall, we find muted effects of AI on employment due to offsetting effects: highly-exposed occupations experience relatively lower demand compared to less exposed occupations, but the resulting increase in firm productivity increases overall employment across all occupations.</content>

    <title>Do Temporary Cash Transfers Stimulate the Macroeconomy? Evidence from Four Case Studies</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Valerie A. Ramey</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper re-evaluates the effectiveness of temporary transfers in stimulating the macroeconomy using evidence from four case studies. The rebirth of Keynesian stabilization policy has lingering costs in terms of higher debt paths, so it is important to assess the benefits of these policies. In each case study, I analyze whether the behavior of the aggregate data is consistent with the transfers providing an effective stimulus. Two of the case studies are reviews of evidence from my recent work on the 2001 and 2008 U.S. tax rebates.  The other two case studies are new analyses of temporary transfers in Singapore and Australia.  In all four instances, the evidence suggests that temporary cash transfers to households likely provided little or no stimulus to the macroeconomy.</content>

    <title>The Social Construction of Race during Reconstruction</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the social construction of race during the United States' Reconstruction Era, a critical juncture between slavery and Jim Crow segregation.  We show that people with the same detailed skin tone, recorded by the Freedman's Bank (1865-1874), were more likely racialized as White or Mulatto by the 1870 Census if they were wealthier or literate.  Our estimates reveal the construction – or rather, reconstruction – of race in a period of unfulfilled potential for social transformation, setting a path for racial segregation and continued racial stratification.  The endogenous historical construction of race also has implications for analyses that compare individuals by race or include race as a control variable.</content>

    <title>Wage Fixing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We model and analyze employer cartels that fix wages by committing to a wage ceiling. The setting is a frictional labor market with large employers that compete for workers via posted wages. Wage fixing reduces competition both inside and outside the cartel, leading to market-wide wage depression. Competition from outside employers disciplines the cartel and hence governs its wage impact and profitability. Consequently, wage-fixing schemes are more likely to emerge and remain stable when the labor market has slack, concentration is high, the span of control is small, product demand is elastic, and firms also collude in the product market. We describe a simple sufficient statistic to gauge the harm caused by a wage-fixing cartel.</content>

    <title>Inappropriate Technology: Evidence from Global Agriculture</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An influential explanation for global productivity differences is that frontier technologies are adapted to the high-income countries that develop them and "inappropriate" elsewhere. We study this hypothesis in agriculture using data on novel plant varieties, patents, output, and the global range of crop pests and pathogens. Innovation focuses on the environmental conditions of technology leaders, and ecological mismatch with these markets reduces technology transfer and production. Combined with a model, our estimates imply that inappropriate technology explains 15-20% of cross-country agricultural productivity differences and re-shapes the potential consequences of innovation policy, the rise of new technology leaders, and environmental change.</content>

    <title>Measuring the Average Period of Production</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The importance of time in production was emphasized by Classical economists and was at the core of the Austrian capital theory proposed by Böhm-Bawerk and further elaborated by Wicksell, Hicks, Dorfman, and many others. A central concept in this literature is the existence of an ‘average period of production’ which governs the demand for circulating capital associated with a production process. Building on Böhm-Bawerk (1889), we propose a measure of the average period of production as a (weighted) average temporal distance between the time at which a firm employs its inputs and the time at which these inputs deliver finished goods that are sold to consumers. We show that, under stationarity conditions, this measure corresponds to the ratio of a firm’s stock of inventories to the cost of the goods it sells in a given period. Using data from publicly traded companies worldwide, we compute and validate this measure for various industries and countries, and show that, consistent with theory, this measure is lower, the higher the cost of capital faced by firms is.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a dynamic urban model combining features of quantitative spatial and macro-housing models. It includes multiple locations, forward-looking households, commuting, costly migration, uninsurable income risk, housing tenure choice, and housing frictions. The model operates in continuous time, with shocks and choices occurring at discrete intervals. This ``mixed time'' approach enables efficient computation of steady-state equilibria and transition dynamics, even with thousands of location pairs. Using a model of the San Francisco Bay Area, we show how forward-looking behavior, spatial frictions, and transition dynamics reshape estimated effects of spatially heterogeneous shocks and policies, traditionally studied with static models.</content>

    <title>Making the Invisible Visible: The Impact of Revealing Indoor Air Pollution on Behavior and Welfare</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Exposure to ambient air pollution has been shown to be detrimental to human health and productivity, and has motivated many policies to reduce such pollution. However, given that humans spend 90% of their time indoors, it is important to understand the degree of exposure to Indoor Air Pollution (IAP), and, if high, ways to reduce it. We design and implement a field experiment in London that monitors households’ IAP and then randomly reveals their IAP in real-time. At baseline, we find that IAP is worse than ambient air pollution when residents are at home and that for 38% of the time, IAP is above World Health Organization standards. Additionally, we observe a large household income-IAP gradient, larger than the income-ambient pollution gradient, highlighting large income disparities in IAP exposure. During our field experiment, we find that the randomized revelation reduces IAP by 17% (1.9 μg/m³) overall and 34% (5 μg/m³) during occupancy time. We show that the mechanism is households using more natural ventilation as a result of the feedback (i.e., opening up doors and windows). Finally, in terms of welfare, we find that: (i) households have a willingness to pay of £4.8 ($6) for every 1 μg/m ³ reduction in indoor PM2.5; (ii) households have a higher willingness to pay for mitigation than for full information; (iii) households have a price elasticity of IAP monitor demand around -0.75; and (iv) a £1 subsidy for an IAP monitor or an air purifier has an infinite marginal value of public funds, i.e., a Pareto improvement.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Headline estimates for the extent of work from home (WFH) differ widely across U.S. surveys. The differences shrink greatly when we harmonize with respect to the WFH concept, target population, and question design. As of 2025, our preferred estimates say that WFH accounts for a quarter of paid workdays among Americans aged 20-64. The WFH rate is seven percentage points higher for workers with children under eight in the household and about two percentage points higher for women than men. Desired WFH rates exceed actual rates in every major demographic group – more so for women, workers with young children, and less educated workers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the relationship between Knightian uncertainty and Bayesian approaches to entrepreneurship. Using Bewley's formal model of uncertainty and incomplete preferences, it demonstrates that key predictions from Bayesian entrepreneurship remain robust when accounting for Knightian uncertainty, particularly regarding experimentation, venture financing, and strategic choice. The analysis shows that while Knightian uncertainty creates a more challenging decision environment, it maintains consistency with the three pillars of Bayesian entrepreneurship: heterogeneous beliefs, stronger entrepreneurial priors, and Bayesian updating. The paper also explores connections to effectuation theory, finding that formal uncertainty models can bridge different entrepreneurial methodologies.</content>

    <title>Long-Run Consequences of Sanctions on Russia</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the long-run economic consequences of Western sanctions on Russia. Using a new framework for balanced growth path analysis, we find that the long-run declines in consumption are significantly larger when capital stocks are allowed to adjust --- 1.4 times larger for Russia and 2.2 times larger for Eastern Europe. This is contrary to the common intuition that long-run effects should be milder due to greater adjustment opportunities. In our model, Russian long-run consumption falls by 8.5%, Eastern European consumption by 2%, and Western countries' consumption by 0.3% in response to sanctions. The model also reveals important distributional effects: as capital adjusts, Russian real wages fall more than rental prices in the long run. These findings show that accounting for capital adjustment is quantitatively important when analyzing trade sanctions.</content>

    <title>Firstborn Daughters and Family Structure in Sub-Saharan Africa</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does the absence of missing baby girls in sub-Saharan Africa imply a lack of son preference in the region? This paper uncovers systematic gendered effects on family structure and fertility in sub-Saharan Africa. Using data from Demographic and Health Surveys, we show that having a firstborn daughter, rather than a son, significantly influences women’s family dynamics. Women with a female firstborn experience higher long-term marriage rates but are less likely to marry the child’s father when the birth occurs prior to formal union. They also face higher divorce rates and greater likelihood of entering polygamous unions. Despite these marital transitions, they tend to have more children. Our analysis further reveals that having a firstborn daughter is associated with poorer living standards and adverse health outcomes for mothers. To examine the mechanisms driving these patterns, we employ a geographic regression discontinuity design along ancestral ethnic borders separating matrilineal and patrilineal traditions. This approach highlights patrilineality as a key driver, shaping both marriage dynamics and fertility.</content>

    <title>Place-Based Policies: Lessons from Theory</title>

      <name>Pablo D. Fajgelbaum &amp; Cecile Gaubert</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We revisit the rationale for place-based policies using a canonical urban framework with agglomeration spillovers. We derive six main lessons. First, the spatial allocation is inefficient even when spillover elasticities are constant across regions. Second, under constant and positive spillover elasticities, the optimal policy is a national wage subsidy funded by a lump sum tax, reallocating activity towards higher wage locations. Third, more generally, a region's optimal labor subsidy rate equals its spillover elasticity. Fourth, place-based policies that favor low-wage locations on efficiency grounds are justified when density has negative spillover effects, spillover elasticities are higher in low-wage locations, or across-skill spillovers favor more mixing in low-wage locations. Fifth, government spending on infrastructure, investment incentives, or housing policies cannot fully correct externalities from labor density. Sixth, housing supply elasticities do not affect the design of first-best place-based policies targeting agglomeration spillovers.</content>

    <title>A Comprehensive GIS Database for China's Surface Transport Network with Implications for Transport and Socioeconomics Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We build a granular GIS database that covers China’s national highways, modern motorways, traditional railways, high-speed railways, and waterways at an annual frequency from 1993 to 2020. Overall network length more than tripled after 1993, with half the increase accounted for by modern motorways and high-speed railways. Mean distance from zip-code centroids in China to nearest motorway access point fell from 302 km in 1993 to 15 km in 2020. Average within-county connectivity to the transport network rose sharply. We also show that discrepancies between distance to nearest motorway access point and straight-line distance to motorway routes are often large, and they correlate with calendar time, terrain features, and economic development. This finding raises concerns about the use of straight-line distance when estimating the causal effects of transport improvements. Our GIS database is freely available on an open-access basis, creating an empirical laboratory for new research in multiple directions.</content>

    <title>Place-Based Policies of the European Union: Contrasts and Similarities to the US Experience</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The European place-based policy framework was established in the European Treaties and has a current budget of $60-70 billion per year. This paper identifies key features and directions for its future development with respect to three place-based problems: traditionally lagging regions; contemporary distressed (or left-behind regions), including those facing the structural challenges of the energy transition; the challenge of spreading prosperity faced with the uneven geography of technological clusters and routine technology-based manufacturing. We analyze the place-based features of EU Cohesion Policy, its commonalities and differences with place-based policies in the US. We evaluate policies against a structural backdrop of long-term convergence in the two continents and the contemporary geography of spatial divergence, using both historical perspectives and recent policy evaluation evidence. Key differences are identified in policy programming, implementation, budgeting and time horizons. While there has been evidence of the reduction of disparities and regional reconversion as a result of place-based policies on both continents, there are also serious impediments to effective implementation in both. These limits have to do with how well policy is designed with respect to economic geography fundamentals as well as political economy and organizational problems in policy design, implementation and governance. The paper concludes by drawing some general lessons on the design of place based policies and examines some of the issues that are particularly relevant for Europe.</content>

    <title>The Dynamics of Agricultural Productivity Gaps: An Open-Economy Perspective</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper draws on cross-country census data to study how agricultural productivity gaps have evolved over the last four decades. We find little tendency for gaps to decline on average despite global decreases in agricultural employment shares. We analyze the dynamics of agricultural productivity gaps through the lens of an open-economy model of structural change. We calibrate the model using international trade data, which are measured independently from sectoral value added and employment data. Quantitatively, the model predicts that relatively faster physical productivity growth in the non-agricultural sector has, in many countries, offset the movement of labor out of agriculture, leading to persistently lower value added per worker in agriculture. Consistent with the model's predictions, previous exports by sector are strong predictors of agricultural productivity gaps in the current cross-section of countries.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how dynamic changes in the search environment affect consumer search and purchase behavior. We develop a dynamic model that incorporates a non-stationary search environment and propose a feasible estimation procedure to estimate its parameters. We apply our model and estimation procedure to the Beijing housing market, utilizing detailed data on consumers' complete search records. We show that accounting for dynamics is crucial for accurately estimating search costs. Additionally, we find that search environment dynamics have a significant impact on consumer decisions and welfare. Housing supply policies that alter search environment dynamics---by increasing the number of new listings and slowing down price increases---benefit consumers, primarily by incentivizing longer searches, more property visits, and ultimately leading to purchases that yield higher utility.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mexico’s pioneering conditional cash transfer program Progresa, later renamed Prospera, operated over two decades in a shifting policy landscape. We exploit the program's sudden and unexpected rollback to estimate whether, two decades after rollout studies documented its initial impacts on schooling and labor, the program still raised enrollment and reduced work in youth. Comparing areas with high and low program penetration before and after rollback, we find that rollback immediately reduced school enrollment, especially in boys of high school age. Effects on enrollment were larger at rollback than they were at rollout, albeit shifted from middle school ages to high school ages. Rising work mirrored falling enrollment in boys of high school age. Our results suggest the program had successfully adapted to the rise of high school, but Mexico's poor were unable to protect their children from its unexpected demise.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This introduction to the Special Issue reviews the existing literature on the domestic politics of international organizations (IOs), presenting them within a unified theoretical framework. We emphasize the central role of domestic forces in the study of IOs: how individual preferences are channeled through domestic political institutions, and ultimately inform a government’s foreign policy decisions toward and within IOs. We show that these forces can be distilled into a game between citizens in which they select welfare weights to be assigned to citizens across the globe. We refer to this as the Citizens’ IO Game. The contributions in this Special Issue and previous studies are discussed in the framework of the Citizens’ IO Game, which offers fresh insights into the intersection of domestic constitutions, politics, resource distribution, and IO membership and policy. We construct a specific application to trade policy to further clarify the role of the framework. Using this example, we show that global externalities can never be fully internalized through IOs when sovereignty is prioritized. We conclude by suggesting directions for future research on the domestic politics of IOs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes an analytic representation of sequence-space Jacobians in heterogeneous agent models with aggregate shocks in continuous time. Our approach is based on a pen-and-paper perturbation of individual policy functions with respect to price changes, rather than numerical or automatic differentiation. We obtain linear partial differential equations that can be solved efficiently. Our continuous time algorithm speeds up computation of Jacobians and impulse responses threefold relative to discrete time. Continuous time is key to take the analytic perturbation in the presence of binding borrowing constraints. We illustrate our approach in leading heterogeneous agent models with and without nominal rigidities.</content>

The returns average 0.159 but vary widely across fields, with a standard deviation of 0.176. Experience profiles of the returns also vary and are particularly steep for medicine. Internal rates of return, which account for program length, tuition, and in-school earnings, are sizable but vary less across fields. Earnings effects are higher for women, lower for part time students, and depend on undergraduate major. Students from lower-paying undergraduate majors benefit more from an MBA or JD. School specific returns are higher for higher ranked JD and MBA programs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how occupational AI exposure impacts employment at the intensive margin, i.e., the length of workdays and the allocation of time between work and leisure. Drawing on individual-level time diary data from 2004–2023, we find that higher AI exposure—whether stemming from the ChatGPT shock or broader AI evolution—is associated with longer work hours and reduced leisure time, primarily due to AI complementing human labor rather than replacing it. This effect is particularly pronounced in contexts where AI significantly enhances marginal productivity and monitoring efficiency. It is further amplified in competitive labor and product markets, where workers have limited bargaining power to retain the benefits of productivity gains, which are often captured by consumers or firms instead. The findings question the expectation that technological advancements alleviate human labor burdens, revealing instead a paradox where such progresses compromise work-life balance.</content>

    <title>Dirty Business: Transition Risk of Factor Portfolios</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Between 2016 and 2023, the top 10% of carbon-emission-intensive firms (heavy emitters) accounted for over 90% of all Scope 1 emissions from U.S. public companies. We observe that about 35% of the market capitalization of ‘Value’ portfolios, compared to 5% of ‘Growth’ portfolios, regardless of how Value and Growth are defined, was comprised of heavy emitters. When we split the Big Value portfolio into heavy- and light-emitter stocks, we find that these two portfolios had similar realized (raw and risk-adjusted) returns and expected returns, as measured by Implied Cost of Capital, suggesting limited incremental compensation for transition risk. We also find that Big Growth low-emitter stocks consistently had lower expected returns than Big Value low-emitter stocks, with the spread widening in recent years, despite similar emission levels. This indicates that factors beyond climate concerns are necessary to fully explain the superior performance of Growth stocks relative to Value stocks over the past decade.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of political polarization on public trust in the Fed and its influence on macroeconomic expectations. Using a large-scale survey experiment which we fielded on President Trump's 2025 inauguration day, we study how households form beliefs about the Fed regarding its political leaning, independence, and trustworthiness. Political alignment significantly shapes perceptions: individuals who view the Fed as politically aligned report higher independence of and trust in the Fed, leading to lower inflation expectations and uncertainty. Strategic communication on institutional structure and policy objectives effectively mitigates perception biases, reinforcing the Fed’s credibility and enhancing its policy effectiveness.</content>

    <title>China's Overseas Lending in Global Finance Cycle</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;China’s rising presence in international finance, which has long lagged behind its prominence in international trade, is now reshaping global financial dynamics. Using a large sample of developing countries, this paper documents that countries more reliant on China’s lending are less exposed to the global financial cycle in exchange rates, equity prices, bond yields, and capital flows. These countries were not less exposed before China became a major lender, and trade linkages to China do not explain these results. Since China lends primarily in dollar, the exposure reduction is not through the traditional channel of mitigating currency mismatch. These findings suggest that international lending plays a unique role in insulating developing countries from global shocks, and through this channel U.S. and Chinese policies interact to shape global financial outcomes.</content>

    <title>Disease, Disparities, and Development: Evidence from Chagas Disease Control in Brazil</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In Latin America—the world's most unequal region—non-white rural populations disproportionately suffer from Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease (NTD) that causes weeks of acute symptoms and can lead to chronic heart problems decades later. We demonstrate that Brazil's post-1983 campaign to eliminate the transmission of this disease significantly reduced (racial) income inequality, the intergenerational transmission of low human capital, and burdens on the world's largest government-run health care system. Exploiting the pre-treatment presence of Chagas disease's main vector, we find that controlling this NTD increased municipalities' GDP per capita by 11.1% and reduced their Gini coefficients by 1.1% in the long run. Furthermore, averting childhood exposure to Chagas disease increased the share of non-white adults with above-median incomes by 1.4 percentage points (p.p., or 2.8%) and their children's literacy rates by 0.4 p.p. (0.5%). Coinciding with the expected reduction in chronic heart problems, we also find that public spending on circulatory disease hospital care declined by 16%, contributing to a 24% internal rate of return and an infinite marginal value of public funds. These results suggest that NTD control can improve the economic and fiscal health of developing countries while mitigating (racial) disparities and intergenerational cycles of poverty.</content>

    <title>Reproductive Technology and the Child Care Sector: How Access to Oral Contraception and Abortion Shaped Workforce Composition and Quality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The composition and quality of the child care workforce may be uniquely sensitive to changes in the complementarities between home production and market work. This paper examines whether the expansion of oral contraceptives and abortion access throughout the 1960's and 1970's influenced the composition, quality, and wages of the child care workforce. Leveraging state-by-birth cohort variation in access to these reproductive technologies, we find that they significantly altered the educational profile of child care workers---increasing the proportion of less-educated women in the sector while reducing the share of highly-educated workers. This shift led to a decline in average education levels and wages within the child care workforce. Furthermore, access to the pill and abortion influenced child care employment differently across settings, with center-based providers losing more high-skilled workers to alternatives with better career opportunities, and home-based and private household providers absorbing more low-skilled women, for whom child care may have remained a viable employment destination. Overall, our findings indicate that increased reproductive autonomy, while expanding women's access to higher-skilled and -paying professions, also resulted in a redistribution of skilled labor away from child care, which may have implications for service quality, child development, and parental employment.</content>

    <title>The Impact of the Out-of-Pocket Housing Expense Inflation on Household Alcohol and Tobacco Purchases</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Housing expense inflation has historically averaged an annual growth rate of 3.0 percent. However, starting in early 2021 housing expense inflation surged, peaking at 8.2 percent by March 2023. Substance use also increased concurrently. This study investigates the impact of rising housing expenses on household purchases of alcohol and tobacco. The relationship is ambiguous: higher housing costs could reduce spending on these items due to constrained disposable income or increase them as a coping mechanism for financial stress. To identify the effects of housing expense inflation we utilize exogenous variation in county-level housing regulations and exposure to housing expense inflation, which affects renters and homeowners differently as homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages are less impacted. In particular, we employ a difference-in-difference-in-difference (DDD) approach, comparing changes in alcohol and tobacco purchases between renters and homeowners, before and after the housing expense surge, across counties with varying housing regulation levels. Our findings reveal that a 1-unit increase in our housing regulation index—equivalent to moving from the 10th to the 90th percentile—correlates with an additional $28.70 (about 15.6 percent) monthly increase in out-of-pocket housing expenses per household member for renters relative to homeowners between 2019 and 2022. This increase is also associated with a 26 to 38 percent rise in financial difficulties among renters compared to homeowners. Furthermore, the same regulatory increase corresponds to a 15.2 percent rise in monthly beer purchases per member among renters relative to homeowners in 2022 compared to 2019, driven largely by low-cost beer. However, we find no significant effect on monthly household purchases of liquor, wine, or cigarettes.</content>

    <title>It Takes a Village Election: Turnover and Performance in Local Bureaucracies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In many countries, local governments struggle with inefficiency and corruption, often perpetuated by entrenched elites. This paper explores how leadership changes affect local bureaucratic performance. Combining personnel and citizen surveys with a regression discontinuity design in a large sample of Indonesian villages, we show that turnovers in village elections revitalize local bureaucracies, disrupt nepotistic networks, and improve local government performance. Bureaucrats serving new leaders are more engaged and less likely to be tied to past or present village officials, resulting in a more responsive bureaucracy that interacts more with citizens and better understands their needs. This improves public service provision, measured in both administrative data and citizen surveys. Overall, our results show that leadership changes can mitigate elite capture and improve governance at the grassroots level.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The recent development of quantitative urban models provides a new set of tools for evaluating transport improvements. Conventional cost-benefit analyses are typically undertaken in partial equilibrium. In contrast, quantitative urban models characterize the spatial distribution of economic activity within cities in general equilibrium. We compare evaluations of a transport improvement using conventional cost-benefit analysis, sufficient statistics approaches based on changes in market access, and model-based counterfactuals. We show that quantitative urban models predict a reorganization of economic activity within cities in response to a transport improvement, which can lead to substantial differences between the predictions of these three approaches for large changes in transport costs.</content>

    <title>The Climate Adaptation Feedback</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many behavioral responses to climate change are carbon-intensive, raising concerns that adaptation may cause additional warming. The sign and magnitude of this feedback depend on how increased emissions from cooling balance against reduced emissions from heating across space and time. We present an empirical approach that forecasts the effect of future adaptive energy use on global average temperature over the 21st century. We find energy-based adaptation will lower global mean surface temperature in 2099 by 0.12 degrees Celsius (0.07 degrees Celsius) relative to baseline projections under RCP8.5 (RCP4.5) and avoid 1.8 (0.6) trillion USD ($2019) in damages. Energy-based adaptation lowers business-as-usual emissions for 85% of countries, reducing the mitigation required to meet their unilateral Nationally Determined Contributions under the UNFCCC by 20% on average. These findings indicate that while business-as-usual adaptive energy use is unlikely to accelerate warming, it raises important implications for countries’ existing mitigation commitments.</content>

    <title>The Impact of NAFTA on Prices and Competition: Evidence from Mexican Manufacturing Plants</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper assesses the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement on Mexican manufacturing plants’ output prices and markups. We distinguish between Mexican goods that are exported and those sold domestically, and decompose their prices separately into markups and marginal costs. We then analyze how these components were affected by the reductions in Mexican output tariffs, intermediate input tariffs, and U.S. tariffs on Mexican exports. We find that domestically sold products saw a decline in prices as Mexican plants faced more competition and gained access to cheaper inputs. Prices of exported goods fell only slightly as plants increased their markups in response to a favorable competitive environment due to declines in U.S. tariffs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Qualitative self-assessments of economic preferences have recently gained popularity, often supported by experimental validation, a method that links them to choices in incentivized elicitations. We illustrate theoretically that experimental validation may fail to produce reliable new measures. Empirically, analyzing data from over 13,000 participants across diverse samples, we document four key findings. First, qualitative self-assessments and traditional incentivized measures exhibit weak correlations, even when accounting for response noise. Second, qualitative self-assessments sometimes correlate more strongly with theoretically distinct incentivized elicitations than those for which they are intended to proxy. Third, relationships between qualitative self-assessments and various attributes---including geographical location, demographics, and behaviors---are unrelated to variation in incentivized elicitations. Fourth, qualitative self-assessments are no simpler for participants than incentivized elicitations: these questions show a common heuristic of extreme or midpoint responses, especially by individuals with lower cognitive ability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To what extent is a worker's relative rank within their workplace a determinant of health status, conditional on income?  We provide the first US-based evidence on the relationship between relative workplace rank and health status for the near population of workers in one US state.  Using a new linkage of commercial all-payer health insurance data to administrative earnings records for workers in Utah from 2013-2015, we quantify the impact of relative workplace rank on health status, the incidence of specific chronic diseases, and racial health disparities.  We show that about 70% of SES-health gradient that is commonly interpreted as an income gradient actually operates through relative rank. For an average worker, moving from the 90th to the 10th percentile of within-firm rank holding fixed income, age, location, and health insurance characteristics is associated with a 16.5% increase in morbidity.  The racial segregation of jobs in the US leads minority workers to be overrepresented in lower-ranked jobs within firms, which in turn exacerbates racial health disparities.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that the response of banks’ net interest margin (NIM) to monetary policy shocks is state dependent. Following a period of low (high) Federal Funds rates, a contractionary monetary policy shock leads to an increase (decrease) in NIM. Aggregate economic activity exhibits a similar state-dependent pattern. To explain these dynamics, we develop a banking model in which social interactions influence households’ attentiveness to deposit interest rates. We embed that framework within a nonlinear heterogeneous-agent NK model. The estimated model accounts well quantitatively for our key empirical findings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper examines whether the US evidence in favour of a nonlinearity in the Phillips curve is robust or fragile. To this end, we use both cross city and aggregate time series data. We are particularly concerned with the possibility that the evidence in favour a nonlinear Phillips curve may is fact be driven by improperly controlling for inflation expectations. Our finding suggest that the evidence in support of a nonlinear Phillips curve is very fragile.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We test whether mental alertness, as proxied by sleep disruption, impairs investor trading performance. Using four complementary approaches, we document that retail investors who experience a later sunset time on average earn lower abnormal returns on their trades. These approaches include panel regression with household fixed effects, RDD based on time zone borders, comparison of different seasons and latitudes, and daylight saving changes. Further tests suggest that the sleep disruption effect derives from impaired investor attention.</content>

    <title>The Curious Surge of Productivity in U.S. Restaurants</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that, after remaining almost constant for almost 30 years, real labor productivity at U.S. restaurants surged over 15% during the COVID pandemic. This surge has persisted even as many conditions have returned to pre-pandemic levels. Using mobile phone data tracking visits and spending at more than 100,000 individual limited service restaurants across the country, we explore the potential sources of the surge. It cannot be explained by economies of scale, expanding market power, or a direct result of COVID-sourced demand fluctuations. The restaurants’ productivity growth rates are strongly correlated, however, with reductions in the amount of time their customers spend in the establishments, particularly with a rising share of customers spending 10 minutes or less. The frequency of such ‘take-out’ customers rose considerably during COVID, even at fast food restaurants, and never went back down. The magnitude of the restaurant-level relationship between productivity and customer dwell time, if applied to the aggregate decrease in dwell time, can explain almost all of the aggregate productivity increase in our sample.</content>

    <title>The Unintended Consequences of Rebalancing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Institutional investors engage in trillions of dollars of regular portfolio rebalancing, often based on calendar schedules or deviations from allocation targets. We document that such rebalancing has a market impact and generates predictable price patterns. When stocks are overweight, funds sell stocks and buy bonds, leading to a decrease in equity returns of 17 basis points over the next day. Our results are robust to controls for momentum, reversals, and macroeconomic information. Importantly, we estimate that current rebalancing practices cost investors about $16 billion annually—or $200 per U.S. household. Moreover, the predictability of these trades enables certain market participants to profit by front-running the orders of large institutional funds. While rebalancing remains a fundamental tool for investors, our findings highlight the costs associated with prevailing strategies and emphasize the need for innovative approaches to mitigate these costs.</content>

    <title>Labor, Loans and Leisure: The Impact of the Student Loan Payment Pause</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Beginning in March 2020 and ultimately continuing to September 2023, most student loan borrowers had their required payments on federal student loans paused. For student loan borrowers with limited access to credit, the payment pause provided additional cash-on-hand that may have allowed them to reduce their work hours. Using survey data capturing individual finances, monthly work characteristics and educational attainment, we find that suspended student debt payments reduced average weekly hours worked by 1.34 (-4%) over a 10-month period with declines concentrated among workers who had not completed a college degree. For borrowers who had completed a college degree or graduate degree, there is no evidence that the payment pause changed employment or hours worked. These findings are consistent with consumer finance data showing that borrower households without a college degree are approximately twice as likely to report liquidity constraints relative to more educated households with federal student debt.</content>

    <title>Skills, Migration and Urban Amenities over the Life Cycle</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine sorting behavior across metropolitan areas by skill over individuals’ life cycles. We show that high-skill workers disproportionately sort into high-amenity areas, but do so relatively early in life. Workers of all skill levels tend to move towards lower-amenity areas during their thirties and forties. Consequently, individuals’ time use and expenditures on activities related to local amenities are U-shaped over the life cycle. This contrasts with well-documented life-cycle consumption profiles, which have an opposite inverted-U shape. We present evidence that the move towards lower-amenity (and lower-cost) metropolitan areas is driven by changes in the number of household children over the life cycle: individuals, particularly the college educated, tend to move towards lower-amenity areas after having their first child. We develop an equilibrium model of location choice, labor supply, and amenity consumption and introduce life-cycle changes in household composition that affect leisure preferences, consumption choices, and required home production time. Key to the model is a complementarity between leisure time spent going out and local amenities, which we estimate to be large and significant. Ignoring this complementarity and the distinction between types of leisure misses the dampening effect child rearing has on urban agglomeration. Since the value of local amenities is capitalized into housing prices, individuals will tend to move to lower-cost locations to avoid paying for amenities they are not consuming.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop and estimate a new model of endogenous growth in bank efficiency and firm productivity in which banks adopt technology embedded in capital goods produced by entrepreneurs, and agents choose whether to become workers or capital-good-producing entrepreneurs. In this framework, bank efficiency influences firm productivity by affecting agents' occupational choices, while firm productivity affects bank efficiency through the relative price of capital goods. We find that increasing technology adoption in the banking system to the level in the top half of the distribution in the data accelerates the economy's long-term growth from 2% to 2.17%. We also find that empirical evidence based on U.S. bank, metropolitan, and state-level data is consistent with the critical mechanisms of our model.</content>

    <title>Greenhouse Gases Resulting from Grid-Connected Electricity Demand: Three Pillars and Scope Two</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many governments and businesses would like to minimize or eliminate the greenhouse gases that result from their purchases of power from electricity grids. Because electricity flows cannot be traced from purchasers back to specific generators, some regulators and users have proposed an approximation. Purchasers would be credited with using clean power if they contract for electricity generated by particular zero-carbon suppliers to the grid or purchase certificates accompanying that zero-carbon generation, so long as those arrangements meet three conditions, or “pillars”: The associated clean power must be generated (1) nearby, (2) during the same hour, and (3) from newly constructed power plants. Whether or not the three pillars are followed, existing or planned electricity generation meeting all three conditions is expected to account for 10 percent of US power in 2030.  We show that the qualifying power would be cleaner than average, but not zero-carbon. Electricity purchases meeting the restrictions will have incremental emissions per megawatt hour 30 to 43 percent below unrestricted average emissions per megawatt hour. The three pillars could have additional climate benefits if demand for clean power exceeds the restricted supply, resulting in less total electricity demand or encouraging construction of new clean electricity capacity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the adoption of clean technology by heterogeneous firms subject to financing constraints. In the model, capital goods differ in terms of their energy needs and age. In equilibrium, cleaner and newer capital requires more financial resources. Therefore, financial constraints induce an endogenous pattern in clean technology adoption: Financially constrained, smaller firms optimally invest in dirtier and older capital than unconstrained, larger firms. The model is consistent with the empirical patterns of technology adoption we document using data on commercial shipping fleets. We use a calibrated version of our model to simulate the aggregate transition dynamics to cleaner technology.</content>

    <title>What Can Trends in Emergency Department Visits Tell Us About Child Mental Health?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Increases in mental health diagnoses and suicidal behaviors in Emergency Departments are often cited as evidence of an accelerating child mental health crisis.  We ask whether trends in ED visits provide an accurate picture of changes in U.S. child mental health.  These measures have been profoundly affected by changing conventions about screening, defining, and coding of mental illness.  We conclude that child mental health has been deteriorating, but not by the startling magnitudes suggested by jumps and trends in some measures.  Although reported suicidal behaviors rose 233% from 2006-2021, the true rise in mental health disorders is less than 30-50%.</content>

    <title>The Effects of Daily Air Pollution on Students and Teachers</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent empirical research shows that air pollution harms student test scores and attendance and increases office discipline referrals. However, the mechanism by which air pollution operates within schools to negatively affect student and teacher outcomes remains largely opaque. The existing literature has primarily focused on the effects of prolonged exposure to pollution on end-of-year test scores or total absence counts. We examine how ambient air pollution influences student-by-day and teacher-by-day outcomes, including absences and office discipline referrals, using daily administrative data from a large urban school district in California between 2003 and 2020. Using wind direction as an instrument for daily pollution exposure, we find that a 10 μg/m3 increase in daily PM2.5 causes a 5.7% increase in full-day student absences and a 28% increase in office referrals in a three-day window. Importantly, the effects are driven by low-income, Black, Hispanic, and younger students. In addition, over three days, a 10 μg/m3 increase in daily PM2.5 causes a 13.1% increase in teacher absences due to illness. Our research indicates that decreasing air pollution in urban areas could enhance both student and teacher attendance, and minimize disruptive behavior in educational settings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate intergenerational mobility of immigrants and their children in fifteen receiving countries. We document large income gaps for first-generation immigrants that diminish in the second generation. Around half of the second-generation gap can be explained by differences in parental income, with the remainder due to differential rates of absolute mobility. The daughters of immigrants enjoy higher absolute mobility than daughters of locals in most destinations, while immigrant sons primarily enjoy this advantage in countries with long histories of immigration. Cross-country differences in absolute mobility are not driven by parental country-of-origin, but instead by destination labor markets and immigration policy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over 2 billion people lack clean drinking water. Existing solutions face high costs (piped water) or low demand (point-of-use chlorine). Using a 60,000 household cluster-randomized experiment we test an increasingly popular alternative: decentralized treatment and home delivery of clean water to the rural poor. At low prices, take-up exceeds 90 percent, sustained throughout the experiment. High prices reduce take-up but are privately profitable. Self-reported health measures improve. We experimentally recover revealed-preference measures of valuation. Willingness-to-pay is several times higher than prior indirect estimates; willingness-to-accept is larger and exceeds marginal cost. On a cost-per-disability-adjusted-life-year basis, free water delivery regimes appear highly cost-effective.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate the effectiveness of randomized interventions aimed at alleviating psychological barriers (maternal stress and difficulty visualizing the future) and addressing information frictions on early childhood immunization uptake in a sample of 2,145 mothers of infants in Pakistan. A phone-delivered intervention providing psychological support and visualization techniques to mothers increases the total number of vaccines received by young children by 0.3, or 7% of the control mean, one year after baseline. The impacts are larger for lower-income households. We also find that the intervention improves maternal knowledge, attitudes, and perceived returns to vaccination, highlighting the role of psychological support in shaping health behaviors. However, supplementing this intervention with vaccination-related information from influencers does not yield additional benefits.</content>

    <title>Competition and Consumer Discrimination</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies consumer discrimination while taking into consideration the role of competition between firms, providing one of the first large-scale comprehensive analyses of consumer discrimination and market forces. We formally model consumer discrimination, where some majority-group members dislike consuming alongside minorities. In equilibrium, the non-discriminatory-to-discriminatory firm ratio is proportional to the minority-to-majority consumer ratio. Empirically, we examine how local changes in the composition of consumers altered business incentives to discriminate during the decades leading up to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Using a nationwide data source of non-discriminatory businesses in three different industries and a research design that leverages two sources of exogenous variation in the ratio of Black-to-White consumers, we find that increases in non-discrimination were concentrated in the least competitive markets, where the threat of defection by White consumers to competing firms was lowest. We assemble new data on over 25,000 prices charged at establishments by discriminatory status and show that non-discriminatory firms charged higher prices than discriminatory firms in the same local market. Consistent with our theoretical model, this finding arises because the effects of greater competition among the more numerous discriminatory firms outweighed the discrimination markup. The results imply that monopoly power blunted the influence of consumer preferences and that Black consumers were harmed through higher prices in the non-discriminatory market.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Technological advances and genomic sequencing opened the road to personalized medicine: specialized therapies targeted to patients displaying specific molecular alterations. For instance, targeted therapies are now available for 50% of lung cancer patients—with some alterations affecting less than 1% of patients—greatly increasing life expectancy. In an investment model of drug development, we show that current institutions mandating experimentation and approval of individual therapies eventually disincentivize investments in personalized medicine as researchers identify increasingly rare alterations. Recent AI-based technologies, such as AlphaFold3, make personalized medicine viable when regulatory approval regards the process for drug discovery rather than individual therapies.</content>

Results are mixed. The share of Black economists remains at 3%. Huge gender penalties in promotion to both associate and full not explained by productivity continue in economics departments. There are no gender penalties in promotion to associate for economists in non-economics departments, although some in promotion to full. There are hardly any significant racial penalties in promotion to either rank, although statistical significance is difficult with such small samples.</content>

    <title>An Evaluation of the Alief Independent School District Jumpstart Program: Using a Model to Recover Mechanisms from an RCT</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper evaluates the Jumpstart Program (JSP), a parenting intervention implemented by a school district in the Houston area to enhance school readiness among economically disadvantaged three-year-old children. Unlike many early childhood programs typically tested in controlled research settings, JSP leverages existing school district resources for scalability and practical application. We conducted a three-year randomized controlled trial to measure the program’s impact on child cognitive outcomes, parental engagement, and mechanisms of change. The results indicate improvements in children’s performance on curriculum-aligned assessments and modest gains in general cognitive readiness as measured by the Bracken School Readiness Assessment. Furthermore, treatment group parents demonstrated increased reading frequency with their children, underscoring enhanced parental involvement as a crucial mechanism behind the program’s success. We employed a structural model to analyze both the direct effects of JSP and its indirect effects through changes in the marginal productivity of investments or preferences via habit formation. Our analysis concludes that 75% of the program’s impact is attributed to direct effects, while 25% is mediated through changes in habit formation in parental investments. Our research underscores the potential of scalable, real-world interventions to bridge socio-economic gaps in early childhood development and inform the design of effective educational policies.</content>

    <title>Equity Prices, Market Power, and Optimal Corporate Tax Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the optimal design of corporate tax policy in a textbook life-cycle model featuring two key deviations: (i) firms are imperfectly competitive and (ii) households save by purchasing equity shares in a stock market. In this simple environment, the financial wealth of savers is equal to the sum of the productive capital owned by firms and a component capturing the NPV of unproductive rents – what we term “market power wealth” (MPW). We show that this novel component has non-trivial macroeconomic effects, with important implications for optimal corporate tax policy. In particular, MPW significantly crowds out productive investment and accordingly can rationalize a high corporate tax rate. The optimal corporate tax code in our setting assigns the statutory corporate tax rate to target the financial value of pure profits while incentivizing capital accumulation with a partial expensing of firm investment costs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a randomized control trial, this paper studies an at-scale preschool construction program that serves poor communities in rural Mozambique. We show that the program significantly increased preschool enrollment in treated communities by 73 percentage points, from a small base of 2 percent of children enrolled in preschool in control communities. The program also had significant positive effects on enrollment in and progression through primary school, with an increase of 6 percentage points in enrollment in first grade at age 6, and a 0.16 standard deviation impact on an index of cognitive and social-emotional skills measured at primary school-age. The impacts are concentrated among children of less educated parents, in less poor households, and living closer to the preschools. We also find that enrollment in preschool is an important direct mechanism for primary school success. Finally, the program caused parents in treated communities to invest more time in supporting their primary school-aged children and increased preschool enrollment of younger siblings. Our paper shows that even in a context of extreme vulnerability, a preschool construction program can be implemented in a cost-effective way and significantly improve child development for the founding and future generations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For most of human history, until the fertility transition, technological progress translated into larger populations, preventing sustained improvements in living standards. We argue that migration offered an escape valve from these Malthusian dynamics after the European discovery and colonization of the Americas. We document a strong relationship between fertility and migration across countries, regions, individuals, and periods, in a variety of datasets and specifications, and with different identification strategies. During the Age of Mass Migration, persistently high fertility across much of Europe created a large reservoir of surplus labor that could find better opportunities in the New World. These migrations, by relieving demographic pressures, accelerated the transition to modern growth.</content>

    <title>‘Invest!’: Liberty Bonds and Stock Ownership over the Twentieth Century</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Liberty Bond drives of World War I were nation-wide interventions aimed at increasing financial literacy and associating bond ownership with patriotism. Using data from the first year of the Survey of Consumer Finances, 1947, through 1971, we investigate whether exposure to the drives shaped investing behavior over the long run. We find that households residing in counties that had high Liberty Bond participation had greater stock and bond ownership rates in later decades, and held more favorable opinions towards retirement saving and stock investment. These effects are present only among cohorts actually exposed to the bond drives, and not among younger cohorts in the same counties, and are robust to an instrumental variables specification that takes advantage of differences in the way the bond drives were conducted. Our estimates imply that household stock ownership rates would have been about 20% lower in the late 1960s if the bond drives had not been conducted.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a concept of a global currency and introduces a “global currency pricing” specification into a standard N-country open economy macroeconomic model.  A global currency is defined as a virtual unit of account that is exclusively used for international trade invoicing and is formed as a basket of individual currencies, similar to the existing SDR. We show there is a unique optimal composition of a global currency that weights currencies according to their importance in international trade.  A striking implication is that under this global currency design, the monetary policy of each country should be concerned solely with domestic shocks. No country should have more than a 50 percent weight in an optimal global currency, and  a situation where a large country has the sole weighting in the global currency is likely to be worst outcome from a perspective of global welfare. We derive the conditions under which global currency pricing (GCP) dominates all other outcomes, and is an optimal choice of invoicing currency for individual firms.</content>

    <title>Are there too Few Publicly Listed Firms in the US?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2017) show that from 1999 to 2012 the US develops a listing gap relative to other countries, meaning that it has abnormally few publicly listed firms. In this paper, we update their evidence to 2023 and find that the listing gap increases, but at a low rate. By 2023, the US has about half as many listed firms per capita as other developed countries. We discuss some of the important questions raised by the existence and increase of the listing gap to which we hope researchers will find answers.</content>

    <title>Should Friday be the New Saturday? Hours Worked and Hours Wanted</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates self-reported wedges between how much people work and how much they want to work, at their current wage. More than two-thirds of full-time workers in German survey data are overworked—actual hours exceed desired hours. We combine this evidence with a simple model of labor supply to assess the welfare consequences of tighter weekly hours limits via willingness-to-pay calculations. According to counterfactuals, the optimal length of the workweek in Germany is 37 hours. Introducing such a cap would raise welfare by .8-1.6% of GDP. The gains from a shortened workweek are largest for workers who are married, female, white collar, middle aged, and high income. An extended analysis integrates a non-constant wage-hours relationship, falling capital returns, and a shrinking tax base.</content>

    <title>Expert Patients’ Use of Avoidable Health Care</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We measure whether expert patients – those trained as physicians and nurses – have fewer emergency department visits and the reasons for these differences. Relative to similar patients physicians and nurses had 19.8% and 5.1% fewer ED visits, principally due to fewer avoidable visits. The differences in avoidable visits between physicians and other patients were largest for diagnoses commonly requiring prescriptions, which physicians often self-prescribed. Our results suggest that improving access to prescriptions for acute symptoms, more than improving patient education, may reduce avoidable health care.</content>

    <title>Expropriation Without Compensation: Copper in Chile, 1970-1973</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this essay, I analyze the nationalization of large copper mines during Salvador Allende’s socialist government in Chile in the 1970s. This is one of the earliest cases “nationalization without compensation.” Chile’s legal argument was based on the novel idea that “adequate” payment should be calculated as book value minus “excessive profits.” In turn, excessive profits were defined, for every year, as profits above 12% of book value. I analyze the economic arguments that led to nationalization, and I deconstruct and critically evaluate the methodology used to calculate “excessive profits” and “adequate compensation.” I analyze the US and multinationals’ response to Chile’s nationalization policies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter surveys new data sources employed in urban and regional economics in the past decade and the insights they have enabled. We first provide a primer on the data sources, including advantages, disadvantages and use cases. Historical data sources include linked census records as well as digitized maps and directories. Contemporary data come from satellites, mobile phones, social media and wikis, posted prices and listings, e-commerce and payment card transactions, newly available administrative sources, and text, among others. We then discuss the advances these data have enabled in substantive areas throughout urban and regional economics, with historical and contemporary examples in each area. We conclude with some predictions and warnings</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use matched employer-employee data to study where Americans live in relation to employer worksites. Mean distance from employee home to employer worksite rose from 15 miles in 2019 to 26 miles in 2023. Twelve percent of employees hired after March 2020 live at least fifty miles from their employers in 2023, triple the pre-pandemic share. Distance from employer rose more for persons in their 30s and 40s, in highly paid employees, and in Finance, Information, and Professional Services. Among persons who stay with the same employer from one year to the next, we find net migration to states with lower top tax rates and areas with cheaper housing. These migration patterns greatly intensify after the pandemic and are much stronger for high earners. Top tax rates fell 5.2 percentage points for high earners who stayed with the same employer but switched states in 2020. Finally, we show that employers treat distant employees as a more flexible margin of adjustment.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Starting in January 2025, New York City became the first city in the United States to introduce a fee for vehicles entering its central business district (CBD). Using Google Maps Traffic Trends, we show that the policy increased speeds in the CBD, had spillovers onto non-CBD roads, and reduced estimated vehicle emissions throughout the metro area. Relative to a set of control cities, average traffic speeds in NYC’s CBD increased by 15% following the introduction of congestion pricing, with larger effects during the most congested hours. Roads commonly traversed on routes to the CBD before the policy have also seen an increase in speeds and a decrease in estimated vehicle CO₂ emission rates. Overall, these speed changes reduced realized travel times on trips to and within the CBD by approximately 8%. The increase in speed is greatest in neighborhoods closer to the CBD, with no significant difference between neighborhoods with different income levels.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Healthcare employment has grown more than twice as fast as the labor force since 1980, overtaking retail trade to become the largest industry by employment in 2009. We document key facts about the rise of healthcare jobs. Earnings for healthcare workers have risen nearly twice as fast as those in other industries, with relatively large increases in the middle and upper-middle parts of the earnings distribution. Healthcare workers have remained predominantly female, with increases in the share of female doctors offsetting increases in the shares of male nurses and aides. Despite a few high-profile examples to the contrary, regions experiencing manufacturing job losses have not systematically reinvented themselves by pivoting from ``manufacturing to meds.''</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study capital regulation in a dynamic model for bank deposits. Capital regulation addresses banks’ incentive for excessive leverage that dilutes depositors, but preserves some dilution to reduce bank defaults. We show theoretically that capital regulation is subject to a time inconsistency problem. In a model with non-maturing deposits where optimal withdrawals make deposits endogenously long-term, we find commitment to have important effects on the optimal level and cyclicality of capital adequacy. Our results call for a systematic framework that limits capital regulators’ discretion.</content>

    <title>Supply Constraints do not Explain House Price and Quantity Growth Across U.S. Cities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The standard view of housing markets holds that the flexibility of local housing supply–shaped by factors like geography and regulation–strongly affects the response of house prices, house quantities and population to rising housing demand. However, from 2000 to 2020, we find that higher income growth predicts the same growth in house prices, housing quantity, and population regardless of a city's estimated housing supply elasticity. We find the same pattern when we expand the sample to 1980 to 2020, use different elasticity measures, and when we instrument for local housing demand. Using a general demand-and-supply framework, we show that our findings imply that constrained housing supply is relatively unimportant in explaining differences in rising house prices among U.S. cities. These results challenge the prevailing view of local housing and labor markets and suggest that easing housing supply constraints may not yield the anticipated improvements in housing affordability.</content>

    <title>Human Capital at Home: Evidence from a Randomized Evaluation in the Philippines</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Children spend most of their time at home in their early years, yet efforts to promote human capital at home in many low- and middle-income settings remain limited. We conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate an intervention which encourages parents and caregivers to foster human capital accumulation among their children between ages 3 and 5, with a focus on math and phonics skills. Children gain 0.52 and 0.51 standard deviations relative to the control group on math and phonics tests, respectively (p&lt;0.001). A year later effects persist, but math gains dissipate to 0.15 (p=0.06) and phonics to 0.13 (p=0.12). We also measure impacts on parents, including both fathers and mothers. Effects appear to be mediated largely through instructional support by parents and not other parent investment mechanisms, such as more positive parent-child interactions or additional time spent on education at home beyond the intervention. We also do not find any crowd-out effects on labor market outcomes, likely since the approach tested is highly efficient, delivering large learning gains in a short period of time. Our results show that parents can be effective conduits of educational instruction even in low-resource settings.</content>

    <title>The Origins and Evolution of Occupational Licensing in the United States</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The analysis of occupational licensing has concentrated largely on its labor market and consumer welfare effects. By contrast, relatively little is known about how occupational licensing laws originated or the key factors in their evolution. In this paper, we study the determinants of U.S. licensing requirements from 1870 to 2020. We begin by developing a model where licensing arises as an endogenous political outcome and use this framework to study how market characteristics and political incentives influence regulators’ choices. Our empirical analysis draws on a novel database tracking the initial enactment of licensing legislation for hundreds of unique occupations, as well as changes to the specific qualifications required to obtain a subset of licenses over time. We first show that, consistent with the predictions of our model, licensing requirements are more common and were adopted earlier for occupations whose tasks plausibly pose some risk to consumers. Second, large, urbanized states are significantly more likely to produce new policies. Third, among occupations regulated before 1940, licensing requirements appeared earlier in states with more practitioners and where incumbent workers likely experienced greater labor market competition. After 1980, state-level factors are more strongly associated with the timing of policy adoption. Finally, political organization, as measured by the establishment of a state professional association, significantly increases the probability of regulation. Together, our findings suggest that both public and private interests have contributed to the diffusion of licensing requirements across states and occupations.</content>

    <title>Why Are Nordic Workers so Remote?: Potential Causes and (Some) Indirect Labor Market Consequences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article, we show that working from home is much more prevalent in the Nordic countries than in the rest of Europe and we discuss potential causes and labor market consequences of this stylized fact. Likely contributing causes include a good technological infrastructure and comparatively widespread digital preparedness in the population.  Recent research also suggests that trust is a crucial prerequisite for maintaining a spatial separation between supervisors and workers in marginal occupations. We show that survey measures of trust are extremely high in all Nordic countries, and that these measures correlate very strongly with work-from-home across countries and industries in Europe even controlling for a range of cross-country differences. Finally, we discuss potential spillover effects of increased hybrid work on the Nordic labor markets. We show evidence suggesting that increased hybrid work has caused a relocation of the production of local service firms from business centers to high-work-from-home residential areas, without affecting average commuting distances of service workers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We generalize the seminal Gibbons-Ross-Shanken test to the empirically relevant case where the number of test assets far exceeds the number of observations. In such a setting, one needs to use a regularized estimator of the covariance matrix of test assets, which leads to biases in the original test statistic. Random Matrix Theory allows us to account for these biases and to evaluate the test’s power. Power increases with the number of test assets and reaches the maximum for a broad range of local alternatives. These conclusions are supported by an extensive simulation study. We implement the test empirically for state-of-the-art candidate efficient portfolios and test assets.</content>

Using a rich, unique dataset we helped assemble, we estimate the empirical relationship between being in a new location and/or multiple locations and the expected interval before an eventual Nobel laureate (ENL) commences their prize-winning work.  We find that being in a new location and in multiple locations are substantially and significantly associated with a shorter expected interval before ENLs commence their prize-winning work.</content>

    <title>A Quest for AI Knowledge</title>
    <updated>2025-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Joshua S. Gans</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative and large language models capable of interpolating precisely between known data points, reshapes scientists' incentives for pursuing novel versus incremental research. Extending the theoretical framework of Carnehl and Schneider (2025), we analyse how decision-makers leverage AI to improve precision within well-defined knowledge domains. We identify conditions under which the availability of AI tools encourages scientists to choose more socially valuable, highly novel research projects, contrasting sharply with traditional patterns of incremental knowledge growth. Our model demonstrates a critical complementarity: scientists strategically align their research novelty choices to maximise the domain where AI can reliably inform decision-making. This dynamic fundamentally transforms the evolution of scientific knowledge, leading either to systematic “stepping stone” expansions or endogenous research cycles of strategic knowledge deepening. We discuss the broader implications for science policy, highlighting how sufficiently capable AI tools could mitigate traditional inefficiencies in scientific innovation, aligning private research incentives closely with the social optimum.</content>

    <title>Methane Abatement Costs in the Oil and Gas Industry: Survey and Synthesis</title>
    <updated>2025-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is growing recognition of the relative importance of anthropogenic emissions of methane as a contributor to global climate change. An important source of such emissions in some countries, including the United States, is the oil and gas (O&amp;G) sector. This points to the importance of developing understanding of the marginal abatement cost functions for methane emissions reductions. Scholars have employed a diverse set of methodologies to estimate abatement costs, including engineering cost models, econometric analysis of natural gas markets, and statistical retrospective analysis of state-level regulation. We critically summarize these approaches and synthesize their results. We find significant potential for low-cost methane abatement in the O&amp;G sector in the United States and elsewhere, although claims of widespread negative abatement cost opportunities should be taken with a grain of salt. We also find that the potential for low-cost abatement is not without limit. Whereas it appears that cutting methane emissions in half would be relatively inexpensive, a sharp uptick in marginal abatement cost may occur when reductions exceed 60 to 80 percent below baseline levels. This threshold may change over time with technological advances in remote sensing, which can reduce abatement costs at various levels of ambition.</content>

    <title>The Academic Consequences of Affirmative Action Bans Combined with Diversity Targets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the problem of a college affected by both a legal ban on affirmative action in admissions and pressure to raise enrollment of underrepresented minorities (URMs), as exemplified by UCLA, which adopted a holistic admissions process in 2006 in response to protests over low URM enrollment. The new process increased the URM share of admitted students by about 3 percentage points, but the primary effects of the changes were on admissions decisions within racial/ethnic groups. Within all groups, admission rates for applicants with high SAT scores and low income and parental education declined. Measured relative to UCLA’s pre-2006 revealed preferences, achieving the increase in URM admissions via holistic admissions was roughly 4-5 times as costly as doing so via a simple reallocation of slots between groups. Had UCLA complied with a stricter interpretation of the affirmative action ban, it would have been significantly more costly.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many community organizations provide services similar to government programs, but there is limited evidence how increased government aid affects the use and availability of charitable services. This study examines how greater access to federal nutrition assistance through schoolwide free meal programs affects food bank use within the U.S.’s largest food bank network. A 10 percent increase in access to free school meals reduces the amount of food that food banks distribute by 0.9-1.4 percent, without significantly reducing donations, fundraising activity, or the amount of food available. The reduction of food bank use is only found in areas where relatively few students previously qualified for government aid. Our findings highlight that even safety net programs that serve a specific population and offer distinct services can reduce pressures on charitable organizations, particularly in areas previously underserved by government assistance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the multigenerational impacts of legalized abortion in the United States by analyzing how early-life exposure to this policy shift affects birth outcomes in the next generation. Using event study and two-way fixed effects models, we link maternal early-life exposure to legal abortion with improved birth outcomes in the subsequent generation, including higher birth weights and reduced rates of low birth weight. Our analysis of the mechanisms shows that these improvements in birth outcomes are not driven by changes in maternal racial or age composition within the treated generation. Instead, enhanced educational attainment and increased prenatal care utilization among the treated generation appear to play a critical role. Our results highlight the far-reaching implications of reproductive health policies, especially relevant in the post-Dobbs era, where access may once again become constrained for many.</content>

    <title>The Effects of Competition in the Retail Gasoline Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the effect of competition on incumbent firm pricing by using high frequency price data and the precise geographic location for all gas stations in California. Using an event study design, we find that the entry of a new station is associated with a 2.5 cent decrease in prices at incumbent stores, which equates to a 7% reduction in estimated retail markups. The effects are immediate, persistent, and show no sign of deterrence or limit pricing behavior. In contrast, nearby exit results in precisely estimated null effects on prices with no evidence of predatory pricing in the lead up to the station departure. The results are consistent across all fuel blends and dissipate with station distance. Finally, we explore the asymmetric effects, showing that the difference cannot be attributed to difference in branding, proximity to highway, or data quality idiosyncrasies, although we find suggestive evidence that exit tends to happen in more competitive markets and amongst less heavily trafficked stations.</content>

    <title>Standardized Test Scores and Academic Performance at Ivy-Plus Colleges</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze admissions and transcript records for students at multiple Ivy-Plus colleges to study the relationship between standardized (SAT/ACT) test scores, high school GPA, and first-year college grades. Standardized test scores predict academic outcomes with a normalized slope four times greater than that from high school GPA, all conditional on students’ race, gender, and socioeconomic status. Standardized test scores also exhibit no calibration bias, as they do not underpredict college performance for students from less advantaged backgrounds. Collectively these results suggest that standardized test scores provide important information to measure applicants’ academic preparation that is not available elsewhere in the application file.</content>

    <title>Recovering Credible Trade Elasticities from Incredible Trade Reforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how trade-policy dynamics affect the dynamics of trade volumes and the implications of these effects for estimates of the trade elasticity. We use data on US imports and trade policy from 1974–2017 for China and Vietnam—the countries with the largest import growth and the largest tariff reductions over the last fifty years—and a heterogeneous-firm dynamic trade model to recover the dynamic path of the trade elasticity following an unanticipated, permanent tariff change. We estimate a short-run trade elasticity of about three and a long-run trade elasticity of about 14, and find that it takes about five years to close half of the gap between the current and long-run levels of trade. We argue that the expected dynamics of future trade policy before and after these reforms biases down reduced-form estimates of the long-run trade elasticity and biases up estimates of the short-run elasticity. We argue that these measurement issues are even more problematic for other trade reforms, especially those within the Normal Trade Relations (NTR) regime that constitute the majority of the data.</content>

    <title>Macroeconomics and Climate Change</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper surveys the literature that links macroeconomics and climate change. We organize our review into three categories: (i) loss and damage, which assesses long-run economic costs and non-market impacts from climate change; (ii) mitigation and the energy transition, which evaluates the macroeconomic consequences of shifting away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy; and (iii) adaptation, which explores the economic adjustments necessary to manage heat stress, more frequent severe weather events and rising seas. We discuss macroeconomic frameworks that quantify these structural shifts as well as empirical estimates that guide their calibration. We suggest areas in which macroeconomic research on climate is needed.</content>

    <title>Racial Disparities and Bias in Consumer Bankruptcy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document substantial racial disparities in consumer bankruptcy outcomes and investigate the role of racial bias in contributing to these disparities. Using data on the near universe of US bankruptcy cases and self-reported and manually-identified measures of race, we show that minority filers are unconditionally 12.7 and 2.3 percentage points more likely to have their bankruptcy cases dismissed without debt relief in Chapters 13 and 7, respectively. We uncover strong evidence of racial homophily: in Chapter 13, where trustees have more discretion, minority filers are 2.3 percentage points more likely to be dismissed when randomly assigned to a White bankruptcy trustee than to a minority trustee. Black and Hispanic Chapter 13 filers are the most negatively affected by homophily. To interpret our findings, we develop a general decision model and new identification results relating homophily to bias. Our homophily approach is particularly useful in settings where traditional outcome tests for bias are not feasible because the decision-maker's objective is not well defined or decision-relevant outcomes or risk factors are unobserved. Applying this framework to our homophily estimate implies that at least 15% of the unconditional Chapter 13 dismissal gap and 53% of the conditional dismissal gap for minority filers is due to either taste-based or inaccurate statistical discrimination.</content>

    <title>The Optimal Monetary Policy Response to Tariffs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What is the optimal monetary policy response to tariffs? This paper explores this question within an open-economy New Keynesian model and shows that the optimal monetary policy response is expansionary, with inflation rising above and beyond the direct effects of tariffs. This result holds regardless of whether tariffs apply to consumption goods or intermediate inputs, whether the shock is temporary or permanent, and whether tariffs address other distortions.</content>

    <title>The Road Not Taken: How Driving Distance and Appointment Availability Shape the Effects of Abortion Bans</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use difference-in-differences research designs to estimate the effects of abortion bans on births at the county level, leveraging data on changes in driving distance and appointment availability at the nearest facility where abortion remains legal. We find that bans alone increase births, but their total impact depends on geographic barriers to access. Even in counties where distance and appointment availability remain unchanged, a total ban leads to a 1.0% increase in births, suggesting a chilling effect—potentially due to legal uncertainty, misinformation, or logistical hurdles—that is independent of measurable barriers. However, the effects grow substantially with travel burdens. In counties where the nearest abortion facility was 50 miles away pre-Dobbs, a total ban increases births by 2.8% when distance rises to 300 miles. Limited appointment availability in destination cities further amplifies these effects, resulting in an additional 0.4 percentage point increase in births. The largest increases occur among Black and Hispanic women, those without a college degree, and unmarried women. We do not observe evidence that the effects have diminished with time despite expanded logistical, financial, and telehealth abortion support, underscoring the persistent role that geographic barriers play in abortion access.</content>
