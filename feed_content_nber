    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This handbook chapter presents the major advances made in the field of economic geography over the past decade. It starts by documenting a number of motivating empirical facts. It then shows how a quantitative regional model that combines the insights from two seminal models from an earlier generation can explain these facts. It then presents a unified quantitative framework that incorporates this and many other economic geography models. This unified framework is sufficiently tractable to characterize its equilibrium properties while flexible enough to be combined with detailed spatial economic data to estimate the model parameters, conduct counterfactuals, and perform welfare analysis. The chapter concludes by discussing many extensions of the framework, some of which have already been explored and others which have not.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Market macrostructure studies the broad organization of financial markets into key players and institutional features, and how this organization affects the level and dynamics of asset prices. We present a simple model to discuss when, why, and how market macrostructure matters for asset prices. We then review work on three specific examples: the rise of passive investing in the stock market, the increased role of central banks in bond markets through asset purchase programs, and the role of levered financial intermediaries in financial markets. We highlight various approaches to tackling macrostructure questions including quasi-natural experiments, equilibrium models, and the use of detailed quantity data on asset positions.</content>

    <title>Capital Structure &amp; Firm Outcomes: Evidence from Dividend Recapitalizations in Private Equity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the causal effect of a large increase in firm leverage. Our setting is dividend recapitalizations in private equity (PE), where portfolio companies take on new debt to pay investor returns. After accounting for positive selection into more debt, we show that dramatically increasing leverage makes firms much riskier. The debt-bankruptcy relationship is in line with Altman-Z model predictions. Dividend recapitalizations increase deal returns but reduce: (a) wages among surviving firms; (b) pre-existing loan prices; and (c) fund returns, which seems to reflect moral hazard via new fundraising. These results suggest negative implications for employees, pre-existing creditors, and investors.</content>

    <title>Minimum Wage Laws and Job Search</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A large theoretical literature on job search predicts that a higher minimum wage will increase the number of job seekers for affected jobs, which can lead to more job creation and higher employment. This paper uses novel data on job search in all U.S. states to examine the effect of minimum wage increases on the number of job seekers for low-skilled positions. We find no evidence that higher minimum wages increase job search for low-skilled jobs. Instead, the evidence suggests that higher minimum wages decrease the number of workers seeking employment.</content>

    <title>A Bayesian Assessment of the Origins of COVID-19 using Spatiotemporal and Zoonotic Data</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Andrew T. Levin</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper uses Bayesian methods in conjunction with spatiotemporal and zoonotic data to evaluate the odds ratio for two hypotheses regarding the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, namely, an accidental laboratory leak of a chimera virus or the transmission of a natural virus from an infected wildlife mammal. The overall Bayes factor is decomposed into 4 components: (1) the odds that the outbreak would occur in the People’s Republic of China (PRC); (2) the odds that the outbreak would occur in Wuhan, conditional on its location in PRC; (3) the odds of observing the spatiotemporal pattern of confirmed COVID-19 cases with no known link to the specific wholesale market where wildlife mammals were being sold, conditional on the outbreak taking place in Wuhan; and (4) the odds of observing the spatiotemporal pattern of confirmed vendor cases at that market, conditional on the outbreak taking place in Wuhan. These four conditional Bayes factors are estimated as 2.3:1, 20:1, 27:1, and 12:1, respectively, and hence the overall odds ratio is 14,900:1, indicating overwhelming evidence in favor of the hypothesis that the pandemic resulted from an accidental lab leak. This conclusion is robust to alternative specifications of the detailed statistical analysis.</content>

    <title>Dismantling the License Raj: The Long Road to India’s 1991 Trade Reforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In July 1991, India began to dismantle its long-standing, highly restrictive import control regime and move toward a more open economy. How were policymakers able to dislodge and replace an entrenched system with powerful vested interests behind it? Standard reasons for policy change—pressure from domestic producer interests, shifts in political power, or conditionality by international financial institutions—fail to explain why the shift in trade policy took place. Instead, reform-minded technocrats persuaded political leaders to reject what had been a standard response to balance of payments pressure (import repression to avoid a devaluation) and embrace a new approach (exchange rate adjustment and a reduction of import restrictions). This paper explores the economic and political context behind the country’s dramatic policy transformation. India’s experience highlights the crucial link between exchange rate policy and trade policy.</content>

    <title>Wealth Tax Enforcement in Sweden: Filing Requirements and Pre-Populated Returns</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Emmanuel Saez &amp; David G. Seim</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper shows that two features of wealth tax administration in Sweden—(1) filing requirements and (2) pre-populated returns—have a large impact on compliance even in an environment with highly-developed third-party reporting through information returns, challenging the conventional wisdom that third-party information returns are a silver bullet for successful tax enforcement. Up to 1993, everybody had to fill in wealth information when filing the (joint) income and wealth tax return. In 1994-1996, only those with net wealth above the exemption threshold (approximately the top 10%) needed to fill in wealth information. This leads to a very large reduction of about half of the number of taxpayers slightly above the wealth tax exemption threshold, and a reduction of about 20% of the total number of wealth taxpayers above the threshold. Starting in 1997, Sweden began pre-populating wealth information on tax returns for taxpayers with third-party-reported net wealth above the exemption threshold. Symmetrically, this immediately doubles the number of taxpayers slightly above the threshold and increases the number of all wealth taxpayers by almost 20%. We also show that the introduction of information returns for financial wealth in 1986 had a comparatively small impact on wealth reporting.</content>

    <title>Causes and Extent of Increasing Partisan Segregation in the U.S. – Evidence from Migration Patterns of 212 Million Voters</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data on the residential location and migration for every voter in U.S. states recording partisan registration between 2008–2020, we find that residential segregation between Democrats and Republicans has increased year over year at all geographic levels, from neighborhoods to Congressional Districts. Individual demographic information reveals that segregation increases for voters of most demographic backgrounds, but that Democratic and Republican trending places have starkly different demographic profiles, thus contributing to the growing confluence of demographics, partisanship, and geography in the United States. We further decompose the change in segregation into different sources. Increases in segregation have not been driven primarily by migration but rather by generational change, as young voters enter the electorate, causing some places to become more homogeneously Democratic, and by existing voters leaving the Democratic party and causing other places to become more Republican.</content>

    <title>Can Machines Learn Weak Signals?</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In high-dimensional regressions with low signal-to-noise ratios, we assess the predictive performance of several prevalent machine learning methods. Theoretical insights show Ridge regression's superiority in exploiting weak signals, surpassing a zero benchmark. In contrast, Lasso fails to exceed this baseline, indicating its learning limitations. Simulations reveal that Random Forest generally outperforms Gradient Boosted Regression Trees when signals are weak. Moreover, Neural Networks with l2-regularization excel in capturing nonlinear functions of weak signals. Our empirical analysis across six economic datasets suggests that the weakness of signals, not necessarily the absence of sparsity, may be Lasso's major limitation in economic predictions.</content>

    <title>Ancient Epics in the Television Age: Mass Media, Identity, and the Rise of Hindu Nationalism in India</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the long-term social and political impacts of mass media exposure to religious content in India. We study the impact of "Ramayan," the massively popular adaptation of the Hindu epic televised in 1987-88. To identify causal effects, we conduct difference-in-difference analyses and exploit variation in TV signal strength driven by location of TV transmitters and topographical features inhibiting electromagnetic TV signal propagation. We find that areas with higher exposure to Ramayan (higher TV signal strength when the show aired) experienced significant cultural and political changes. First, we document a strengthening of religious identity among Hindus: parents in these areas became more likely to give their newborn sons traditionally Hindu names, and households showed increased adherence to orthodox Hindu dietary practices. In the short term, this cultural shift led to an increase in Hindu-Muslim communal violence through 1992. Over the longer term, through 2000, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) became more likely to win state assembly elections. Analyses of changes in local TV signal strength in India over decades indicate that these effects are not due to general access to TV but are due to exposure to the Ramayan TV show in 1987-1988. Our findings reveal that media portrayal of religious narratives can have lasting effects on cultural identity, intergroup violence, and electoral outcomes.</content>

    <title>The Long and Short of Financial Development</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;By improving the pledgeability of returns to financiers, financial development enhances a producer’s ability to raise capital to fund long term complex investments. Consequently, it should increase output and welfare. However, a general equilibrium analysis suggests this is not always so. We consider an economy where producers and consuming/financing households are distinct agents, where producers lack sufficient capital, and where households care about both pledgeable returns and liquidity. In this economy, the greater pledgeability of long-term project earnings can reduce long term production and overall welfare, even though it makes financing more accessible. Our results have implications for why economies face impediments to financial development and overall growth, especially when producer capital is scarce.</content>

    <title>Declining Youth Well-being in 167 UN Countries. Does Survey Mode, or Question Matter?</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>David G. Blanchflower</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I find evidence from 167/193 UN member countries that the young have lower levels of well-being than older age groups, using self-reported data collected on the internet from the Global Minds internet-based surveys of 2020-2024 using their MHQ measure.  We found that the evidence on the mental health of the young was different when self-reported, internet-based responses were used compared with those obtained via an interviewer, either face-to-face or via the telephone.  Our analysis of the United States using 14 surveys taken using all three methods always found the young had the lowest well-being of any age group.  The evidence for relatively low youth well-being on we collected using four major European surveys was stronger in internet-based surveys and when negative affect variables rather than life satisfaction and happiness were used.  The young were significantly more lonely and more unhappy than all other age group, in 26/27 EU member countries in the internet-based EU Loneliness Survey of 2022. We also examined the Global Flourishing survey of 2022-2024 across 22 countries that used both telephone and web-based surveys and the results showed rising well-being in age, in the internet surveys and declining well-being in age in the telephone surveys.  Mode of survey and question used matters.  The young are experiencing a mental health crisis globally picked up especially in self-reports.  This is new.</content>

    <title>HANK's Response to Aggregate Uncertainty in an Estimated Business Cycle Model</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Cosmin L. Ilut, Ralph Luetticke &amp; Martin Schneider</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies a HANK model with agents who respond to both idiosyncratic and aggregate uncertainty. Since aggregate uncertainty is modeled as ambiguity, it affects the steady state and linearized dynamics, allowing for fast computation and estimation. The interaction of aggregate uncertainty shocks and portfolio frictions generates a high capital premium as well as most cyclical comovement in macroeconomic aggregates. Heterogeneity in portfolios is crucial: when it is shut down, the model fails to explain investment dynamics and the capital premium disappears. Cautious price and wage setting by firms in anticipation of aggregate uncertainty shapes employment and inflation dynamics.</content>

    <title>Geographic Resolution in Environmental Policy: EPA's Shift from Regions to Counties Under the Clean Air Act</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A large literature uses nonattainment status under the U.S. Clean Air Act (CAA) to measure regulatory stringency and to instrument for air pollution in studies of the impact of the CAA on health and other endpoints. Since 1978 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has regulated ambient air quality at the county level; however, prior to 1978 nonattainment status was imposed on Air Quality Control Regions, contiguous counties that comprise an airshed. This is not the definition of nonattainment used in the literature. Using county-level data, we examine the impacts of EPA’s definition of nonattainment status for TSP, CO, ozone, and SO2 in 1972 on ambient air quality and manufacturing employment between 1969 and 1976 and EPA’s definition of nonattainment in 1978 on air quality and manufacturing employment between 1975 and 1988. Nonattainment status in 1972 had no significant impact on either ambient TSP or on the ratio of dirty manufacturing to total employment between 1969 and 1976. We do, however, find significant impacts on ambient TSP using 1978 nonattainment status, and significant impacts of TSP, CO, ozone and SO2 nonattainment in 1978 on the fraction of employment in dirty manufacturing industries from 1975 to 1988. We discuss the implications of these findings for EPA’s decision regarding the geographic level at which to regulate air pollution.</content>

    <title>What Do Managers Do? An Economist's Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economic activity, when sufficiently ambitious, requires motivating and coordinating individuals to work toward a common goal. These aims are the purview of managers. What, however, do managers actually do? We outline three defining principles of economic research on managers and relate them to the set of skills reported by managers on LinkedIn. We highlight “managers of people” and “managers of projects” as a useful distinction for categorizing theoretical, empirical, and descriptive accounts of managers. In light of our three principles, we review research on how managers can create value— namely, by hiring, retaining, training, monitoring, evaluating, allocating, and supervising. We propose that managers apply these skills in different proportions depending on the production technology in which they are embedded and that research on managers should seek to produce generalizable insights by exploring managers’ contributions in different contexts.</content>

    <title>The Potential of Public Employment Reallocation as a Place-Based Policy</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Dimitria Freitas</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Increasing within-country disparities have led policymakers to deploy public employment reallocation as a place-based policy tool to support struggling regions. This paper surveys the economics literature on capital relocations, purpose-built capitals, and public agency decentralization programs, synthesizing their effects on population, employment, and GDP. I find that while relocating capital cities can spur employment, GDP, and population growth in receiving regions, they entail highly unpredictable costs (3–12% of GDP) and uncertain environmental outcomes. Decentralization programs yield positive short-run public-to-private employment multipliers (around 0.7) stemming from the non-traded sector, but the long-term effect on the traded sector remains ambiguous. Local initial conditions seem to matter more than ex-post spillovers in determining multiplier size. Although more evidence is needed, sending regions do not seem to be extensively harmed when public jobs leave. Given the large share of government payroll in national expenditures, reallocating public employment may hold considerable potential for regional development in the future.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Refugees require assistance for basic needs like housing but local host communities may feel excluded from that assistance, potentially affecting community relations. This study experimentally evaluates the effect of a housing assistance program for Syrian refugees in Jordan on both the recipients and their neighbors. The program offered full rental subsidies and landlord incentives for housing improvements, but saw only moderate uptake, in part due to landlord reluctance. The program improved short-run housing quality and lowered housing expenditures, but did not yield sustained economic benefits, partly due to redistribution of aid. The program unexpectedly led to a deterioration in child socio-emotional well-being, and also strained relations between Jordanian neighbors and refugees. In all, housing subsidies had limited measurable benefits for refugee well-being while worsening social cohesion, highlighting the possible need for alternative forms of aid.</content>

    <title>The Evolution of Unobserved Skill Returns in the U.S.: A New Approach Using Panel Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economists disagree about the factors driving the substantial increase in residual wage inequality in the US over the past few decades. To identify changes in the returns to unobserved skills, we make a novel assumption about the dynamics of skills rather than about the stability of skill distributions across cohorts, as is standard. We show that our assumption is supported by data on test score dynamics for older workers in the HRS. Using survey data from the PSID and administrative data from the IRS and SSA, we estimate that the returns to unobserved skills declined substantially in the late-1980s and 1990s despite an increase in residual inequality. Accounting for firm-specific pay differences yields similar results. Extending our framework to consider occupational differences in returns to skill and multiple unobserved skills, we further show that skill returns display similar patterns for workers employed in each of cognitive, routine, and social occupations. Finally, our results suggest that increasing skill dispersion, driven by rising skill volatility, explains most of the growth in residual wage inequality since the 1980s.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is little causal evidence on factors that can protect individuals against Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) risk. We study the causal effect of education on ADRD, exploiting a regression discontinuity generated by a compulsory schooling reform. ADRD was ascertained based on medical history, hospital records, and death registries, addressing concerns about selective sample attrition. We find that education reduces incidence of ADRD and may delay its onset. Using molecular genetic data, we show that the reform weakened the relationship between genetics and ADRD incidence, implying this genetic risk is not immutable and can be modified by social policy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate the economic forces that contribute to Google’s large market share in web search. We develop a model of search engine demand in which consumer choices are influenced by switching costs, quality beliefs, and inattention, and estimate it using a field experiment with US desktop internet users. We find that (i) requiring Google users to make an active choice among search engines increases Bing’s market share by only 1.1 percentage points, implying that switching costs play a limited role; (ii) Google users who accept our payment to try Bing for two weeks update positively about its relative quality, with 33 percent preferring to continue using it; and (iii) after changing the default from Google to Bing, many users do not switch back, consistent with persistent inattention. In our model, correcting beliefs and removing choice frictions would increase Bing’s market share by 15 percentage points and increase consumer surplus by $6 per consumer-year. Policies that expose users to alternative search engines lower Google’s market share more than those requiring active choice. We then use Microsoft search logs to assess the impact of additional data on search result relevance. The results suggest that sharing Google’s click-and-query data with Microsoft may have a limited effect on market shares.</content>

    <title>Environmental Migration and Race during the Great American Drought, 1935-1940</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study racial differences in internal migration responses to one of the most severe climatic shocks in US history—the drought of the 1930s. Using data from the 1940 census on 65 million adults, we find that individuals exposed to more severe drought between 1935 and 1940 were more likely to make an inter-county move and that this responsiveness was greater for black individuals than white individuals. This racial difference was particularly pronounced among the rural population. Black individuals' migration premium came despite their systematic disadvantage in the economy of the 1930s and evidence along dimensions other than race that disadvantage limited individuals' ability to adapt to the drought through migration. Federal relief spending under the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) magnified this racial difference, reducing the migration response to drought for white individuals and increasing it for black individuals. These results help to better understand how the reaction of different groups aggregate to determine the magnitude and composition of migration responses to natural disasters, as well as the roles of migration and government policy in disadvantaged groups' responses to natural disasters.</content>

    <title>Health Insurance as Economic Stimulus? Evidence from Long-Term Care Jobs</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage decades of administrative data and quasi-experimental variation in the introduction of universal long-term care (LTC) insurance in Germany in 1995 to examine whether health insurance expansions can stimulate local economies. We find that the LTC insurance rollout led not only to sizeable growth of the target LTC sector, but also to an aggregate fall in unemployment and an increase in the labor force participation. Quantitatively, a 10 percentage point increase in the share of insured LTC patients led to 4 more nursing home workers per 1,000 individuals age 65 and older (12% increase). Wages did not rise in the LTC sector or other sectors of the economy. The quality of newly hired nursing home workers declined, but this had no negative effect on old-age life expectancy. Overall, the insurance expansion brought lower-skilled workers into new jobs rather than reallocating workers away from other productive sectors. Our marginal value of public funds (MVPF) analysis suggests that the reform paid for itself when taking the positive fiscal externalities in the labor market into account. To understand which market primitives underpin our findings and to inform the external validity of our results, we develop and estimate a general model of labor markets with product-market subsidies in the presence of wedges, such as income taxes. Our model simulations show that the aggregate welfare effects of insurance expansions are theoretically ambiguous and depend centrally on the magnitude of frictions in input markets.</content>

    <title>Does the Gender Wage Gap Actually Reflect Taste Discrimination Against Women?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One explanation of the gender wage gap is taste discrimination, as in Becker (1957). We test for taste discrimination by constructing a novel measure of misogyny using Google Trends data on searches that include derogatory terms for women. We find—surprisingly, in our view—that misogyny is an economically meaningful and statistically significant predictor of the wage gap. We also test more explicit implications of taste discrimination. The data are inconsistent with the Becker taste discrimination model, based on the tests used in Charles and Guryan (2008). But the data are consistent with the effects of taste discrimination against women in search models (Black, 1995), in which discrimination on the part of even a small group of misogynists can result in a wage gap.</content>

    <title>Do Place-Based Industrial Interventions Help "Left-Behind" Workers? Lessons from WWII and Beyond</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Place-based industrial interventions—policies that promote production and investment in specific regions—are often proposed with the intent of improving economic conditions for residents, particularly "left-behind" workers in distressed local labor markets. This chapter discusses the theoretical rationale for the use of industrial interventions to achieve distributional goals and evidence about their effectiveness to that end. I use government-funded plant construction during World War II (WWII) in the United States as a focal case study, which I then compare and contrast to other industrial interventions studied in the literature. While government plant construction during WWII drove an expansion of high-wage semi-skilled jobs open to local residents, which in turn fueled an increase in upward mobility among local residents, the evidence from more recent interventions suggests that modern plant sitings often fail to yield similar benefits to local workers. The implementation details of industrial interventions matter crucially for their incidence on local workers. Interventions that generate opportunities for up-skilling and occupational advancement accessible to target populations appear to be most likely to generate meaningful distributional benefits. I argue that while core production goals during WWII happened to inherently align with the promotion of upward mobility, such alignment is not guaranteed in general and may be the exception rather than the rule in modern contexts.</content>

    <title>The Targeting of Place-Based Policies: The New Markets Tax Credit Versus Opportunity Zones</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For a place-based policy to succeed, it must target the right areas—typically those with lower economic development and resident well-being. The U.S. has two major place-based tax policies: the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC), where government approved entities select investments, and Opportunity Zones (OZs), where private investors choose projects. Despite underlying design differences, both target census tracts with relatively high poverty rates, low median income and weak labor markets. However, OZs tend to attract more investment in areas with higher pre-existing private investment, often located in prosperous counties and high-growth regions. Census tracts lacking investment from either program generally have less private investment, lower home value growth, and lower population growth, suggesting that additional policies may be needed to reach areas less primed for investment.</content>

    <title>Climate Transition Risks and the Energy Sector</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We build a general equilibrium model to study how climate transition risks affect energy prices and the valuations of different firms in the energy sector. We consider two types of fossil fuel firms: incumbents that have developed oil reserves they can extract today or tomorrow, and new entrants that must invest in exploration and drilling today to have reserves to potentially extract tomorrow. There are also renewable energy firms that produce emission-free energy but cannot currently serve non-electrifiable sectors of the economy. We analyze three sources of climate transition risk: (i) changes in the probability of a technological breakthrough that allows renewable energy firms to serve all economic sectors; (ii) changes in expected future taxes on carbon emissions; and (iii) restrictions on today's development of additional fossil fuel production capacity. We show that different transition risks—and, importantly, uncertainty about their realizations—have distinct effects on firms' decisions, on their valuations, and on equilibrium energy prices. We provide empirical support for the heterogeneous effects of different transition risks on energy prices and stock returns of firms in different energy sub-sectors.</content>

    <title>Reconciling Macroeconomics and Finance for the U.S. Corporate Sector: 1929 to Present</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how to quantitatively reconcile the high volatility of market valuations of U.S. corporations with the relative stability of macroeconomic quantities since 1929. Macroeconomic and financial variables are measured in a consistent fashion using the Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts (IMA) of the United States. We first use a finance- style valuation model that builds on Campbell and Shiller (1987) to interpret fluctuations in the market value of U.S. corporations from 1929 to 2023, using these IMA data. We find that fluctuations in expected cash flows to firm owners have been the dominant driver of those fluctuations in value; fluctuations in expected rates of return have played a smaller role. We then develop a stochastic growth model, extended to incorporate factorless income, which we use to decompose corporate cash flows and associated valuations into income and value due to physical capital and factorless income. Finally, we ask whether expected returns to investing in capital in our macroeconomic model are consistent with the series for expected returns estimated from our finance-style valuation model. We find that they are. In this sense, we reconcile volatile market valuations and stable capital output ratios.</content>

    <title>Childbirth and Firm Performance: Evidence from Norwegian Entrepreneurs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using multiple administrative data sources from Norway, we examine how firm performance changes after entrepreneurs become parents. Female-owned businesses experience a substantial decline in profits, steadily decreasing to 30% below baseline ten years post-childbirth. In contrast, male-owned businesses show no decline, often growing in revenues and costs after childbirth. The profit decline for female-owned firms is most pronounced among highly capable entrepreneurs, women who are majority owners, and those with working spouses. Entrepreneurial effort is key to performance, and our findings suggest that time demands from childbirth and childcare are a significant determinant of the decline in firm profits.</content>

Our random forest model trained on local and national GDP achieves an R² above 0.92 for GDP levels and above 0.62 for annual changes in regions left out of the training sample. By incorporating diverse indicators beyond population and nighttime lights, our estimates offer more precise subnational GDP measurements for analyzing economic shocks, local policies, and regional disparities. We evaluate the precision of our estimates with a sample case of COVID-19’s impact on local GDP in China.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;During World War II, the U.S. Committee on Medical Research (CMR) undertook an integrated, cross-sectoral effort to develop medical science and technology for war, representing the U.S. government's first substantial investment in medical research. Using data on all CMR research contracts, we show that although it had mixed results during the war, it left a large imprint on the postwar U.S. biomedical innovation system. Research areas it supported experienced rapid growth in postwar science, especially in new subjects. It also stimulated the U.S. pharmaceutical industry's adoption of modern science-based drug discovery, fueled new postwar drug development, influenced medical practice, and shaped extramural research funding at the National Institutes of Health. Contemporary accounts of individual CMR programs point to specific ways these investments enabled old and new subjects to grow. The evidence documents the long-run effects coordinated, application-oriented biomedical research can have on science and technology and challenges the influential 'linear model' paradigm in research policy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We exploit policy discontinuities in Poland's unemployment insurance to examine the causal effect of changes to both benefit durations and levels. Using a regression discontinuity approach, we uncover three findings: (1) Higher benefit levels distort employment more than benefit extensions. (2) Benefit durations and levels interact: Longer durations substantially increase the distortionary effect of more generous payments. (3) Higher payments increase the transition of employed workers into unemployment. We develop a model of optimal unemployment insurance that accounts for moral hazard among both employed and unemployed workers. Notably, for level increases, distortionary costs are larger among the employed than unemployed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Emerging markets face large and persistent fluctuations in sovereign spreads. To what extent are these fluctuations driven by local shocks versus financial conditions in advanced economies? To answer this question, we develop a neoclassical business cycle model of a world economy with an advanced country, the North, and many emerging market economies, the South. Northern households invest in domestic stocks, domestic defaultable bonds, and international sovereign debt. Over the 2008-2016 period, the global cycle phase, the North accounts for 68% of Southern spreads’ fluctuations. Over the whole 1994-2024 period, however, Northern shocks account for less than 20% of these fluctuations.</content>

    <title>Income Equality in The Nordic Countries: Myths, Facts, and Lessons</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Policymakers, public commentators, and researchers often cite the Nordic countries as examples of a social and economic model that successfully combines low income inequality with prosperity and growth. This article aims to critically assess this claim by integrating theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence to illustrate how the Nordic model functions and why these countries experience low inequality. Our analysis suggests that income equality in the Nordics is primarily driven by a significant compression of hourly wages, reducing the returns to labor market skills and education. This appears to be achieved through a wage bargaining system characterized by strong coordination both within and across industries. This finding contrasts with other commonly cited explanations for Nordic income equality, such as redistribution through the tax-transfer system, public spending on goods that complement employment, and public policies aimed at equalizing skills and human capital distribution. We consider the potential lessons for other economies that seek to reduce income equality. We conclude by discussing several underexplored or unresolved questions and issues.</content>

    <title>Did the Modern Mortgage Set the Stage for the U.S. Baby Boom?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes that the adoption of the modern U.S. mortgage (i.e., low down payment, long-term, and fixed-rate)—led by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Veteran’s Administration (VA) loan insurance programs—set the stage for the mid-twentieth century U.S. baby boom by dramatically raising rates of home ownership for young families. Using newly digitized data on FHA- and VA- backed loan issuance and births by state-year, and a novel instrumental variables strategy that isolates supply-side variation in loan issuance, we find that the FHA and VA mortgage insurance programs led to 3 million additional births from 1935-1957, roughly 10 percent of the excess births in the baby boom. Aggregate effects mask differences by group—we find no effects of FHA/VA lending on births for Nonwhite women, consistent with well-documented racial discrimination in these lending programs. Our results highlight the importance of access to home ownership for fertility decisions.</content>

    <title>Firm Pay and Worker Search</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Whether and how workers search on the job depends on their beliefs about pay and working conditions in other firms. Yet little is known about workers' knowledge of outside pay. We use a large-scale survey of full-time German workers, linked to their Social Security records, to elicit pay expectations and preferences over specific outside firms. Workers believe that they face considerable heterogeneity in their outside pay options, and direct their search toward firms they believe would pay them more. Workers' expected firm-specific pay premia are highly correlated with pay policies observed in administrative records and with workers' valuations of firm-specific amenities. Most workers are unwilling to search for a new job—or leave their current firm—even for substantial pay increases. Switching costs are equivalent to 7 to 18% of a worker’s annual pay. Attachment varies across firms, and cannot be explained by either differences in firm-specific amenities or switching costs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the recent literature that studies the spatial distribution of economic activity across both space and time. We discuss the methodological advances enabling the incorporation of dynamic forces of economic activity—such as endogenous innovation, forward-looking location choices, capital and asset accumulation, idea diffusion, and stochastic fundamentals—into frameworks with many heterogeneous locations and a rich economic geography. These frameworks remain tractable for quantitative evaluations. We also discuss the wide range of empirical questions explored in recent work through the lens of these frameworks, including the global and local economic impacts of climate change, the dynamic effects of trade and migration policy, labor market adjustments to import competition, the spatial consequences of structural change, the dynamic effects of place-based policies, and the long-run spatial effects of large-scale infrastructure projects.</content>

    <title>Institutions, Technology and Prosperity</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper reviews the main motivations and arguments of my work on comparative development, colonialism and institutional change, which was often carried out jointly with James Robinson and Simon Johnson. I then provide a simple framework to organize these ideas and connect them with my research on innovation and technology. The framework is centered around a utility-technology possibilities frontier, which delineates the possible distributions of resources in a society both for given technology and working via different technological choices. It highlights how various types of institutions, market structures, norms and ideologies influence moves along the frontier and shifts of the frontier, and it provides a simple formalization of the social forces that lead to institutional persistence and those that can trigger institutional change. The framework also enables us to conceptualize how, during periods of disruption, existing—and sometimes quite small—differences can have amplified effects on prosperity and institutional trajectories. In this way, it suggests some parallels between different disruptive periods, including the onset of European colonialism, the spread (or lack thereof) of industrial technologies in the 19th century, and decisions related to the use, adoption and development of AI today.</content>

    <title>Do Inflation Expectations Become More Anchored During a Disinflation Episode? Evidence for Euro Area Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does a successful disinflation contribute to the anchoring of inflation expectations? We provide novel survey evidence on the dynamics of euro area firms’ inflation expectations during the disinflation episode since 2022. We show that firms’ short term inflation expectations declined steadily towards the inflation target as the disinflation progressed. However, we also document a thick tail in longer-term inflation expectations, substantial disagreement about the inflation outlook, and an increased sensitivity of longer-term inflation expectations to short-term inflation expectations. These findings suggest that it may take more time to bring inflation expectations fully in line with central bank objectives.</content>

    <title>Evidence on the Importance of Market Competition in Distress Propagation</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using local natural disasters as a quasi-experimental setting, we show that heightened distress risk in shocked firms drives both these firms and their unshocked competitors to cut profit margins by about 0.8 percentage points. These reductions stem from predatory pricing, inventory liquidation, and weakened tacit collusion in product markets. Distress propagates horizontally as unshocked competitors rationally respond almost 1-for-1 with profit-margin cuts, significantly increasing their distress risk. Spillovers are more pronounced in tradable industries or those with higher barriers to leadership, larger inventories, greater price flexibility, or tighter financial constraints, revealing a novel channel for distress propagation across the economy.</content>

    <title>Rigidities in Transportation and Supply Chain Disruptions</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper we provide a simple and intuitive story for supply chain disruptions driven by the rigidities in the transportation sector. Focusing on maritime shipping, we argue that the frequent macroeconomic shocks that shape demand for transportation, meet a highly inelastic supply curve for transportation services. The steepness is driven by equilibrium bottlenecks in ships (transportation agents) and ports (transportation infrastructure). This leads to highly volatile shipping prices and port congestion, affecting importers and exporters worldwide. We discuss how both global trade and inflation react to these costs, so that disruptions pass through to the entire economy.</content>

    <title>Moral Hazard and the Sustainability of Income-Driven Repayment Plans</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans tie student loan repayment to income and forgive unpaid debt after certain years of repayment. We investigate how these features affect one’s career choices through a survey where the same student is asked to select job profiles under various repayment plans. Consistent with our Ben-Porath style model, the survey results reveal that IDR is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, 36% of students underinvest in their human capital under the standard repayment plan relative to their would-be choices in a debt-free scenario; an IDR resembling the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan reduces this fraction to 20%. On the other hand, IDRs induce moral hazards: Under a SAVE-like plan, 22% of students choose job profiles with lower initial wages and higher wage growth than their choices in a debt-free scenario, leaving part of their debt forgiven. A simple calculation indicates that this type of moral hazard alone would render SAVE-like plans inviable were they carried out by private lenders; however, government-run IDRs are sustainable due to the government’s capacity to collect individuals’ lifetime income taxes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the link between the diffusion of artificial intelligence (AI) enabled technologies and changes in the female employment share  in 16 European countries over the period 2011-2019. Using data for occupations at the 3-digit level, we find that on average female employment shares  increased in occupations more exposed to AI.   Countries with high initial female labor force participation and higher initial female relative education show a stronger positive association. While there exists heterogeneity across countries, almost all show a positive relation between changes in female employment shares within occupations and exposure to AI-enabled automation.</content>

    <title>Financial Looting and Controls on Resident Outflows</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops a theory of preemptive controls on capital outflows by residents as a second-best tool to mitigate boom-bust cycles in domestic asset markets and prevent wealth transfers from uninformed traders to pump-and-dump speculators, or financial “looters,” as in Akerlof and Romer (1993). The model implies that when domestic financial regulation is imperfectly designed or enforced, controls on residents' outflows reduce retail investor manipulation (which we call looting), stabilize asset prices, and diminish capital flight. The paper also provides compelling evidence that supports the main implications of the model when applied to housing markets, which is particularly relevant to institutions in developing countries. We find that deposit outflows to haven countries increase before busts in house prices, and countries with stricter controls on resident outflows experience significantly more contained deposit outflows to such destinations. The empirical analysis reveals a similar pattern for new incorporations in haven countries based on data from the Panama Papers.</content>

    <title>The Experimentalist Looks Within: Toward an Understanding of Within-Subject Experimental Designs</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>John A. List</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The traditional approach in experimental economics is to use a between-subject design:  the analyst places each unit in treatment or control simultaneously and recovers treatment effects via differencing conditional expectations.  Within-subject designs represent a significant departure from this method, as the same unit is observed in both treatment and control conditions sequentially.  While many might consider the choice straightforward (always opt for a between-subject design), given the distinct benefits of within-subject designs, I argue that researchers should meticulously weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each design type.  In doing so, I propose a categorization for within-subject designs based on the plausibility of recovering an internally valid estimate.  In one instance, which I denote as stealth designs, the analyst should unequivocally choose a within-subject design rather than a between-subject design.</content>

    <title>ESG Is The Most Polarizing Nonwage Amenity: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Brazil</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine job-seekers' heterogeneous preferences for nonwage amenities, with a focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices, using an incentivized field experiment in Brazil. Our findings reveal that ESG is the most polarizing nonwage amenity across multiple sociodemographic groups, with the strongest preferences observed among highly educated, white, and politically liberal individuals (Colonnelli et al., 2025). While women report a stronger preference for work-from-home policies, all other nonwage amenities exhibit minimal variation across sociodemographic groups. Our findings highlight the critical role of corporate values in shaping economic outcomes within an increasingly polarized society.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the determinants and the dynamics of the exchange rate pass-through of the Japanese exporters, utilizing the official Customs declaration data. We first estimated the invoicing currency exchange rate pass-through and found that export prices invoiced in producer currency are the most rigid. Among local currency or vehicle currency use, US dollar invoicing is relatively more rigid than non-US dollar invoicing. The destination exchange rate pass-through estimates for local currency invoicing are between 35 and 40 percent, whereas those for Japanese yen or US dollar invoicing are close to complete. In addition, we find these discrepancies are even more accentuated in the longer run by analyzing the dynamics of the exchange rate pass-through.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research at the intersection of development and spatial economics is increasingly important to address pressing issues in rapidly-urbanizing cities in low- and middle- income countries. This handbook chapter presents the canonical spatial model and then explores it through the lens of development economics, pointing out the "on-the-ground" facts of missing markets, frictions, and context-specific parameters that are often absent in applications of the model. We then discuss what the existing literature and the spatial model tell us about the optimal allocation of labor across space. We close by highlighting exciting possibilities for future work that integrates the spatial model with the reality of low- and middle-income countries.</content>

    <title>Does Loan Securitization Expose Borrowers to Non-Bank Investor Shocks?—Evidence from Insurers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;CLOs fund 65% of syndicated loans, theoretically insulating borrowers from bank and idiosyncratic investor shocks. However, concentrated capital and sticky relationships expose firms to idiosyncratic shocks to insurers, the largest CLO investors. We find that: 1) insurers experiencing favorable cash flows invest more in CLOs, especially with familiar managers; 2) CLO managers exposed to these cash flows launch more deals; 3) using an instrumental–variable approach, affected firms take out more loans at lower spreads, increase employment, and expand operations; 4) effects are stronger for private than public firms. These findings reveal significant frictions in the loan securitization market.</content>

    <title>Quick-Fixing: Near-Rationality in Consumption and Savings Behavior</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When optimizing consumption-savings decisions is costly, people may instead rely on quick-fixes, simple policy functions that avoid these costs. We introduce a model of quick-fixing. To study it empirically, we field a novel survey that measures households' consumption policy functions in response to income shocks. Almost 70% of households follow one of four simple quick-fixes that fully consume or fully save out of small shocks, but they abruptly adjust their behavior for large shocks. This behavior accounts for almost half of the cross-sectional variance in marginal propensities to consume, but is poorly predicted by other demographic and economic information. In an incomplete-markets model calibrated to match our evidence, we find that quick-fixing is near-rational: the average opportunity cost of quick-fixing is only $17 per quarter. Yet, this small, empirically realistic deviation from the rational model significantly alters aggregate consumption responses to income shocks of varying sizes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Student loan forgiveness has been proposed as a means to alleviate soaring student loan burdens. This paper uses administrative credit bureau data to study the distributional, consumption, borrowing, and employment effects of the largest event of student loan forgiveness in history. Beginning in March 2021, the United States federal government ordered $132 billion in student loans cancelled, or 7.8% of the total $1.7 trillion in outstanding student debt. We estimate that forgiven borrowers’ predicted monthly earnings were $115 higher than borrowers who did not receive forgiveness and $193 more than the general population. We find that student loan forgiveness led to increases in mortgage, auto, and credit card debt by 9 cents for every dollar forgiven. Borrowers’ monthly earnings and employment fell, at increasing rates for each month post forgiveness. The implied Marginal Propensities for Consumption (MPC) and Earnings (MPE) are 0.27 and -0.49, respectively.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Males comprise a small fraction of the nurse labor force, yet across the distribution of wages, male nurses earn more than females. In this paper, we use nurse survey data to decompose the sex-based wage gap and to explore why male nurses earn a premium in a female-dominated profession. We consider the role of traditional factors such as human capital and family structure, along with explanations that are more specific to nursing. Results indicate that overtime pay is a significant factor, particularly among hospital workers, but otherwise, after accounting for an extensive set of job-related characteristics, the wage gap persists.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nearly 400,000 Black men were drafted into the National Army during World War I, where they toiled in segregated units and received little formal training. Leveraging novel variation from the WWI draft lottery and millions of digitized military and NAACP records, we document the pioneering role these men would play in the early civil rights movement. Relative to observably similar individuals from the same draft board, Black men randomly inducted into the Army were significantly more likely to join the nascent NAACP and to become prominent community leaders in the New Negro era. We find little evidence that these effects are explained by migration or improved socioeconomic status. Rather, corroborating historical accounts about the catalyzing influence of institutional racism in the military, we show that increased civic activism was driven by soldiers who experienced the most discriminatory treatment while serving their country.</content>

    <title>The Hidden Toll of Airborne Lead: Infant Mortality Impacts of Industrial Lead Pollution</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Karen Clay, Edson R. Severnini &amp; Xiao Wang</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper uses U.S. Toxic Release Inventory data on air lead emissions to provide IV estimates of the effects of air lead concentration on infant mortality. The causal effect of lead on infant mortality is identified by annual variation in air fugitive lead emissions interacted with wind speed near reporting plants, which together determine local ambient lead concentration. Unlike stack emissions, which occur routinely and may prompt avoidance behavior, fugitive emissions are intermittent and influenced by both historical and current factors, such as wind speed variation, making them difficult to avoid. The paper has two main findings. First, higher air lead concentration causes higher infant mortality in the first month and in the first year, suggesting that both in utero and environmental exposures matter. Second, higher lead concentration increases deaths from low birthweight, sudden unexplained infant death (SUID), and respiratory and nervous system causes, which is consistent with findings from animal studies, even when accounting for behavioral responses. Back of the envelope calculations indicate that declines in fugitive lead emissions prevented 34-59 infant deaths per year, generating benefits of $380-$670 million annually in 2023 dollars.</content>

    <title>Charting the Uncharted: The (Un)Intended Consequences of Oil Sanctions and Dark Shipping</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the rise of dark shipping – oil tankers disabling AIS transceivers to evade detection – amid Western sanctions on Iran, Syria, North Korea, Venezuela, and Russia. Using a machine learning-based ship clustering model, we track dark-shipped crude oil trade flows worldwide and detect unauthorized ship-to-ship transfers. From 2017 to 2023, dark ships transported an estimated 7.8 million metric tons of crude oil monthly – 43% of global seaborne crude exports – with China absorbing 15%. These sanctioned flows offset recorded declines in global oil exports but create distinct economic shifts. The U.S., a net oil exporter, faces lower oil prices but benefits from cheaper Chinese imports, driving deflationary growth. The EU, a net importer, contends with rising energy costs yet gains from Chinese demand, fueling inflationary expansion. China, leveraging discounted oil, boosts industrial output, propagating global economic shocks. Our findings expose dark shipping’s central role in reshaping oil markets and macroeconomic dynamics.</content>

    <title>Labor Market Monopsony: Fundamentals and Frontiers</title>

      <name>Patrick M. Kline</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter reviews the theory of monopsonistic wage setting, its empirical implications, and some puzzles the framework has struggled to explain. We begin by examining the fundamentals of monopsonistic wage determination. The core of the theory is a mapping from the distribution of worker outside options to wages. We study non-parametric shape restrictions that ensure this mapping is unique. Building on these results, we introduce a menu of tractable parametrizations of labor supply to the firm, some of which are shown to emerge naturally from equilibrium search models. Next, we review why wage markdowns do not necessarily signal inefficiency and discuss some criteria for assessing misallocation in a monopsony model with search frictions. Turning to the model’s empirical implications, we examine how the magnitude of productivity-wage passthrough depends on the super-elasticity of labor supply to the firm and establish that compensating differentials for firm amenities depend on the curvature of the outside option distribution. We show that firm-specific shifts in either productivity or amenities can be used as instruments to identify labor supply elasticities and review strategies for estimating non-constant elasticities. We then consider extensions of the basic model involving third-degree wage discrimination and examine their ability to rationalize patterns of worker-firm sorting. Monopsony models traditionally assume that firms commit to posted wages. Relaxing this assumption, we develop a connection between the first-order conditions of the monopsony model and models of bargaining with incomplete information. These models explain why bilateral inefficiencies may persist in the presence of negotiation, yield predictions about the response of within-firm wage dispersion to productivity shocks, and suggest reasons why some productivity shifters may not constitute excludable instruments. Next, we endogenize productivity by allowing for efficiency wages, non-constant returns to scale, and price-cost markups. Empirical monopsony estimates often suggest that firms enjoy implausibly large profit margins. We argue that allowing for non-constant labor supply elasticities and firm adjustment costs can potentially resolve this difficulty. Finally, we review why the strong passthrough of minimum wages to product prices presents a challenging puzzle for standard monopsony models and discuss potential reconciliations to this puzzle involving firm heterogeneity, quality changes, and lumpy price adjustment.</content>

    <title>The Effect of US COVID-19 Excess Mortality on Social Security Outlays</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant excess mortality among the US population, impacting the future outlays of the US Social Security Administration (SSA) Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program. This study aimed to estimate the net effects of pandemic-induced excess deaths on OASDI liabilities, utilizing dynamic microsimulation models, and examined how these effects vary across different socioeconomic and racial-ethnic groups. Data on excess deaths were obtained from the CDC and processed to account for seasonal variations and demographic disparities. The simulation incorporated demographic and health status variables to project OASDI retirement and disability benefits, and survivors’ benefits for spouses and children, for respondents with highest COVID mortality risk. The pandemic resulted in approximately 1.7 million excess deaths among individuals aged 25 and older between 2020 and 2023. These premature deaths reduced future retirement payments, which increased the Social Security fund by $294 billion. However, this gain was offset by reductions in future payroll tax flows ($58 billion) and increased payments to surviving spouses and children ($32 billion), resulting in a net impact of $205 billion. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic decedents left behind more underage children per capita, yet payments to their surviving family members were lower compared to non-Hispanic White decedents, across all educational levels. Excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic has complex implications for the OASDI program. While there is an estimated net positive financial impact due to reduced future retirement benefits, this effect is mitigated by decreased payroll tax contributions and increased survivors’ benefits. The differential impact by race and ethnicity highlights existing inequalities and underscores the importance of considering demographic disparities in future projections of Social Security liabilities. These findings provide critical insights for informing SSA trust fund projections and policy decisions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether genome-wide summary measures of genetic risk known as polygenic indices (PGIs) provide new insights into the efficacy of the Lung Health Study (LHS)–a large, randomized controlled trial (RCT) that evaluated the effect of a smoking cessation intervention program on cessation maintenance and lung function. Results indicate that the intervention was less successful for participants with higher PGIs for smoking initiation and intensity. Given the increasing availability and affordability of genomic data, we argue that in the context of RCTs, PGIs can further our understanding of heterogeneous treatment effects and the mechanisms that may be driving them.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using surveys of households across thirteen countries, we study how much individuals would be willing to pay to eliminate business cycles. These direct estimates are much higher than traditional measures following Lucas (2003): on average, households would be prepared to sacrifice around 5-6% of their lifetime consumption to eliminate business cycle fluctuations. A similar result holds for inflation: to bring inflation to their desired rate, individuals would be willing to sacrifice around 5% of their consumption. Willingness to pay to eliminate business cycles and inflation is generally higher for those whose consumption is more pro-cyclical, those who are more uncertain about the economic outlook, and those who live in countries with greater historical volatility.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ensuring broad access to the patent system is crucial for fostering innovation and promoting economic growth. To support this goal, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office offers reduced fees for small and micro entities. This paper investigates whether fee rates affect the filing of applications by small and micro entities. Exploiting recent fee reforms, the study evaluates the relationship between fee changes and the number of new entrants, controlling for potential confounding factors such as legislative changes. The findings suggest that fee reductions alone are insufficient to significantly increase participation in the patent system among small and micro entities.</content>

    <title>Killer Congestion: Temperature, Healthcare Utilization and Patient Outcomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Extreme heat imperils health and results in more emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. Since temperature affects many individuals within a region simultaneously, these health impacts could lead to surges in healthcare demand that generate hospital congestion. Climate change will only exacerbate these challenges. In this paper, we provide the first estimates of the health impacts from extreme heat that unpacks the direct effects from the indirect ones that arise due to hospital congestion. Using data from Mexico’s largest healthcare subsystem, we find that ED visits rise by 7.5% and hospitalizations by 4% given daily maximum temperatures above 34◦C. As a result, more (and sicker) ED patients are discharged home, and deaths within the hospital increase. While some of those hospital deaths can be directly attributed to extreme heat, our analysis suggests that approximately over half of these excess deaths can be viewed as spillover impacts due to hospital congestion. Additional analyses also reveal an increase in the share of deaths occurring outside hospitals, consistent with congestion-related health harms arising from the discharge of sicker patients from the ED. Our findings highlight an important new avenue of adaptation to climate change. If hospital congestion contributes to excess health damages from a changing climate, then expanding labor and capital investments and improving surge management tools can help reduce those damages.</content>

    <title>The Welfare Benefits of Pay-As-You-Go Financing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Pay-as-you-go (PAYGo) financing is a novel contract that has recently become a popular form of credit, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). PAYGo financing relies on lockout technology that enables the lender to remotely disable the flow benefits of collateral when the borrower misses payments. This paper quantifies the welfare implications of PAYGo financing. We develop a dynamic structural model of consumers and estimate the model using a multi-arm, large scale pricing experiment conducted by a fintech lender that offers PAYGo financing for smartphones. We find that the welfare gains from access to PAYGo financing are equivalent to a 3.4% increase in income while remaining highly profitable for the lender. The welfare gains are larger for low-risk consumers and consumers in the middle of the income distribution. Under reasonable assumptions, PAYGo financing outperforms traditional secured loans for all but the riskiest consumers. We explore contract design and identify variations of the PAYGo contract that further improve welfare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study venture capital (VC) selection using the deal flow and investment decisions for more than 8,000 sourced deals from one early-stage VC in detail.  The (unconditional) likelihood that a sourced start-up raises at least $1 million in VC funding from some VC firm is roughly 30%.  The deals the VC scored and invested in perform better than the deals the VC scored and did not invest which perform better than the deals the VC did not score, suggesting that the VC has selection ability.  At the same time, the selection is noisy as only 32% (13%) of the invested firms have raised more than $10 ($25) million in VC funding.  The VC evaluated the deals it scored on team, market, product and exit characteristics.  Team is most successful at explaining VC funding of at least $1 million, but does not explain larger financings or success.  Market and product have more explanatory power for VC funding of more than $10, $25 and $50 million as well as longer term outcomes.  Consistent with other recent work, this is consistent with VCs overweighting team in their initial investment decision.</content>

    <title>The Price of Faith: Economic Costs and Religious Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do economic costs affect religious choices, and how do religious institutions adapt to economic realities? We study the Seventh-Day Adventist (SDA) church in Sub-Saharan Africa, which prohibits production of tobacco, coffee, and tea, creating salient opportunity costs for potential members in areas suitable for these crops. We construct a measure of SDA membership opportunity cost that varies over time and space based on local crop suitability and export prices. Using church administrative data and member surveys, we find that increased opportunity costs lead to lower membership growth and lower satisfaction with the church among existing members. The church responds by establishing new educational and health institutions and reducing emphasis on "healthy living" religious tenets. These findings reveal how religious organizations can show striking flexibility in balancing tradition and adaptation when faced with economic pressures. Our study provides new insights into the microeconomics of cultural change, as mediated by religious institutions.</content>

    <title>Declining Life Satisfaction and Happiness Among Young Adults in Six English-speaking Countries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We report eleven studies that show declines in life satisfaction and happiness among young adults in the last decade or so, with less uniform trends among older adults. We found consistent evidence for this for the U.S. in the recent sweeps of several micro data sets including the Behavioral Risk Factor Survey, the General Social Survey, and the American National Election Survey.  In the U. S. life satisfaction rises with age. This is broadly confirmed in several other datasets including four from the European Commission across five other English-speaking countries: Australia, Canada, Ireland New Zealand and the UK. Declining wellbeing of the young was also found in the World Values Survey, the Global Flourishing Study and Global Minds. There is broad evidence across all of these English-speaking countries that happiness and life satisfaction since 2020 rise with age. In several of these surveys we also find that ill-being declines in age. The U-shape in wellbeing by age that used to exist in these countries is now gone, replaced by a crisis in wellbeing among the young.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using China's expansion of the high-speed rail system (HSR) as a quasi-natural experiment, we analyze the comprehensive vehicle registration data from 2010 to 2023 to estimate the causal impact of HSR connectivity on the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). Implementing several identification strategies, including staggered difference-in-differences (DID), Callaway and Sant'Anna (CS) DID, and two instrumental-variable approaches, we consistently find that, by alleviating range anxiety, the expansion of HSR can account for up to one third of the increase in EV market share and EV sales in China during our sample period, with effects particularly pronounced in cities served by faster HSR lines. The results remain robust when controlling for local industrial policies, charging infrastructure growth, supply-side factors, and economic development. We also find that HSR connectivity amplifies the effectiveness of charging infrastructure and consumer purchase subsidies in promoting EV adoption.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Residential properties with the lowest rent levels provide the highest investment returns to their owners. Using detailed rent, cost, and price data from the United States, Belgium, and The Netherlands, we show that this phenomenon holds across housing markets and time. If anything, low-rent units hedge business cycle risk. We also find no evidence for differential regulatory risk exposure. We document segmentation of investors, with large corporate landlords shying away from the low-tier segment possibly for reputational reasons. Financial constraints prevent renters from purchasing their property and medium-sized landlords from scaling up, sustaining excess risk-adjusted returns. Low-income tenants ultimately pay the price for this segmentation in the form of a high rent burden.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the impact of digital technology on employment patterns in Korea, where firms have rapidly adopted digital technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and the internet of things (IoT). By exploiting regional variations in technology exposure, we find significant negative effects on high-skill and female workers, particularly those in non-IT (information technology) services. This contrasts with previous technological disruptions, such as the IT revolution and robotization, which primarily affected low-skill male workers in manufacturing. In IT services, although high-skill employment declined, vacancy postings for high-skill workers increased, implying a shift in labor demand toward newer skill sets. These findings highlight both the labor displacement and the new opportunities generated by digital transformation.</content>

    <title>Does Peer Review Penalize Scientific Risk Taking? Evidence from NIH Grant Renewals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scientific projects that carry a high degree of risk may be more likely to lead to breakthroughs yet also face challenges in winning the support necessary to be carried out. We analyze the determinants of renewal for more than 100,000 R01 grants from the National Institutes of Health between 1980 and 2015. We use four distinct proxies to measure risk taking: extreme tail outcomes, disruptiveness, pivoting from an investigator’s prior work, and standing out from the crowd in one’s field. After carefully controlling for investigator, grant, and institution characteristics, we measure the association between risk taking and grant renewal. Across each of these measures, we find that risky grants are renewed at markedly lower rates than less risky ones. We also provide evidence that the magnitude of the risk penalty is magnified for more novel areas of research and novice investigators, consistent with the academic community’s perception that current scientific institutions do not motivate exploratory research adequately.</content>

    <title>Guaranteed Employment in Rural India: Intra-Household Labor and Resource Allocation Consequences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I investigate the intra-household labor and resource allocation consequences of an employment guarantee targeting rural households in India. The guarantee insures household earnings, replacing women as added workers and shutting down a motive for saving. Despite sizable program-job take-up, the guarantee decreases participation in other working activities, and, thus, the labor force participation of married women and total time worked by their husbands. The guarantee accounts for up to 30% of a recent countrywide decrease in rural female labor force participation. Though it increases household consumption, the guarantee reduces the command of household earnings by women, and, thereby, their well-being.</content>

    <title>Policy Interventions and China’s Stock Market in the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;China’s stock market greatly outperformed other national markets during the first several months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it did so even before it became evident that early containment efforts would flounder in the United States and many other countries. As to why, one view holds that aggressive monetary and credit easing propped up Chinese equity values. To assess this view, we consider several interventions that eased monetary and credit conditions in the first six months of 2020. Our analysis finds clear evidence that these interventions raised implied stock market volatility but little evidence that they influenced stock price levels. We also consider policy actions that restricted short selling, limited stock sales, and boosted stock purchases. These efforts to raise net equity demand were small in scale and highly time-limited, as we discuss, suggesting that any direct effects on stock prices were also modest. Neither our study nor other work known to us provides a ready explanation for the extraordinary performance of China’s stock market in the first half of 2020. This performance is even more striking in hindsight, given later developments in China’s economy and stock market.</content>

    <title>Monetary Policy Under Okun’s Hypothesis</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The current monetary policy framework of the Fed intends to be more ’inclusive’ by running the economy hot for longer during expansions. The logic of this strategy rests on Okun’s (1973) hypothesis that sustaining a ‘high-pressure economy’ persistently improves labor market outcomes of low-wage workers. To evaluate this conjecture, we develop a Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian framework with a three-state frictional model of the labor market where low-skilled workers are more exposed to the business cycle and recessions have a long-lasting effect on their labor force participation and earnings, in line with the evidence. Under a canonical Inflation Targeting rule, the ZLB generates a deflationary bias and severely amplifies the persistent scars of recessions at the bottom of the wage distribution. The Lower-for-Longer strategy is an effective antidote to the ZLB-driven hysteresis and leads to notable earnings gains for low-wage workers and a reduction to overall earnings inequality. If pursued aggressively, however, the policy reverts the inflation bias from negative to positive. Since policymakers might prioritize differently inflation relative to inclusion, we conclude by quantifying the inflation-inclusion trade-off implied by various monetary policy rules.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Information technology (IT) can enhance firms’ long-run performance but is also a risky investment, with high fixed costs and uncertain returns. Whether market events influence this tradeoff has received limited attention. We leverage the healthcare context to empirically examine hospitals’ IT investments following economic downturns and public insurance expansions––i.e., large industry shocks in opposite directions. We find novel and symmetrical responses. Recessions restrain investments while expansion policy indirectly stimulates them. Importantly, the IT margin is more elastic than other spending responses to market fluctuations. Supplementary analyses suggest that hospitals’ finances and perceptions of uncertainty drive these capital investment adjustments.</content>

    <title>Dodging Day Zero: Drought, Adaptation, and Inequality in Cape Town</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A near-catastrophic drought in Cape Town, South Africa illustrates three general implications of climate change for publicly-provided utility services. First, to reduce aggregate water demand, the public utility increased prices, leading to large demand reductions by richer households. Prior to the drought they use twice the public piped water of poorer households. At the peak of the drought, they use less. Second, some of the differential demand reduction comes from richer households substituting away from public water toward privately financed groundwater.  This private adaptation both lowers the public utility's total revenue and shifts costs onto poorer households, consequences that persist after the drought abates.  Third, policy interventions mitigate some of the fiscal and distributional impacts of private adaptation. These findings highlight how climate adaptation, in the context of publicly provided goods and services, can create pecuniary and environmental externalities with equity consequences.</content>

    <title>Firm Trade Exposure, Labor Market Competition, and the Worker Incidence of Trade Shocks</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how the composition of firm exposure and competition among imperfectly substitutable workers mediate the earnings, welfare, and unemployment incidence of changes in the international trade environment. We merge LEHD job match records with firm-level import and export records from the LFTTD and use them to estimate a large-scale assignment model of the entire U.S. labor market.  The model flexibly accommodates frictions from switching regions, industries, trade engagement status, and even particular employers. We construct firm-level estimates of the employment impact of China's WTO entry using exogenous tariff gap variation via four different channels, import and export competition and import and export access, and combine them with the model to evaluate the shock's worker-level incidence.
Our results show that the firm composition of shock exposure does matter for medium-run worker-level earnings incidence, with workers at the highly exposed multinational manufacturing firms experiencing the largest shock-induced earnings losses.  However, labor market competition causes the shock's impact to spread to seemingly unaffected sectors and trickle down the skill ladder, so that entry-level non-traded service workers and initially unemployed job-seekers account for a large share of earnings losses and particularly unemployment increases.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce, analyze, and describe subnational data on cross-gender friendships for nearly 200 countries and territories, using data from 1.38 trillion ties between 1.8 billion Facebook users. Homophily by gender exists nearly everywhere, with individuals' strongest ties exhibiting less homophily than their peripheral connections. Across countries, cross-gender friendship rates align with existing measures of gender disparities. Within countries, cross-gender friending rates correlate with support for gender equality. In the US, cross-gender friendships are rarer in areas with a larger White share of the population, higher incomes, and more per-capita religious congregations.</content>

    <title>The Minimum Wage, Turnover, and the Shape of the Wage Distribution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes an empirical approach to decompose the distributional effects of minimum wages into effects for workers moving out of employment, workers moving into employment, and workers continuing in employment. We estimate the effects of the minimum wage on the hazard rate for wages, which provides a convenient way of re-scaling the wage distribution to control for possible employment effects. We find that minimum wage increases do not result in an abnormal concentration of Job Leavers below the new minimum wage, which is inconsistent with employment effects predicted by a neoclassical model. We also find that, for Job Stayers, the spike and spillover effects of the minimum wage are simply shifted right to the new minimum wage. Our findings are consistent with a model where entry wages are set according to a job ladder, and where firms anchor their internal wage structure on the minimum wage due to fairness or internal incentives issues.</content>

    <title>Micro and Macro Cost-Price Dynamics in Normal Times and During Inflation Surges</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study cost-price dynamics in normal times and during inflation surges. Using microdata on firms’ prices and production costs we construct an empirical measure of price gaps—the deviation between a firm’s listed and optimal price. We then examine the mapping between gaps and price changes in the cross-section of firms and derive implications for inflation dynamics in the time-series. In the microdata, pricing policies display state-dependence: firms are more likely to adjust prices as their price gap widens, a mechanism that becomes quantitatively significant when large aggregate cost shocks occur. In normal times, adjustment probabilities are approximately constant and the microdata conform with the predictions of time-dependent models (e.g., Calvo 1983). Conditional on a path of aggregate cost shocks extracted from the data, we show that a generalized state-dependent pricing model accounts well for the pre-pandemic era’s low and stable inflation and the nonlinear surge observed during the pandemic.</content>

    <title>The Mental Health of the Young in Asia and the Middle East: The Importance of Self-Reports</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>David G. Blanchflower &amp; Alex Bryson</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the age profile of subjective wellbeing and illbeing in nine Asian countries (Bangladesh, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka) and seven Middle Eastern countries (Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Yemen).  We find the relationship between age and reported wellbeing differs according to the way the survey is conducted. In the Gallup World Poll, where the data are collected by interviewers face-to-face or by telephone (computer-aided telephone interviews, or CATI) the young are the happiest and the results are the same across the two survey modes.  We find the same result in CATI surveys in the Global Flourishing Survey (GFS) of 2022-2024 in 7 Asian and Middle Eastern (AME) countries.  However, when the GFS survey is conducted on the web (computer-aided web interview, or CAWI) wellbeing is u-shaped in age, and is highest among the oldest respondents. If we turn to negative affect measures (loneliness, anxiety, depression, worry) these rise with age using CATI but fall with age using CAWI. We look for survey mode switching in the age coefficient across 40 outcomes.  In general, the switch is confined to subjective wellbeing and illbeing metrics.  Switching does not occur when respondents are asked about their physical health, bodily pain, unemployment status, drinking and smoking, or personality-related questions.  It appears that the mode effect is largely confined to how individuals rate their subjective wellbeing and illbeing. The results are suggestive of social desirability response bias which leads young people to under-report socially undesirable affective states to interviewers.</content>

    <title>Misspecification-Robust Shrinkage and Selection for VAR Forecasts and IRFs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;VARs are often estimated with Bayesian techniques to cope with model dimensionality. The posterior means define a class of shrinkage estimators, indexed by hyperparameters that determine the relative weight on maximum likelihood estimates and prior means. In a Bayesian setting, it is natural to choose these  hyperparameters by maximizing  the marginal data density. However, this is undesirable if the VAR is misspecified. In this paper, we derive asymptotically unbiased estimates of the multi-step forecasting risk and the impulse response estimation risk to determine hyperparameters in settings where the VAR is (potentially)  misspecified. The proposed criteria can be used to jointly select the optimal shrinkage hyperparameter, VAR lag length, and to choose among different types of multi-step-ahead predictors; or among IRF estimates based on VARs and local projections. The selection approach is illustrated in a Monte Carlo study and an empirical application.</content>

    <title>Bank Debt, Mutual Fund Equity, and Swing Pricing in Liquidity Provision</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Liquidity provision is often attributed to debt-issuing intermediaries like banks. We develop a unified theoretical framework and empirically show that mutual funds issuing demandable equity also provide an economically significant amount of liquidity by insuring against idiosyncratic liquidity shocks. Quantitatively, bond funds provide 12.5% of the liquidity that banks provide per dollar.  Our model further shows that when equity values incorporate the liquidation cost from redemptions, as in swing pricing, liquidity provision is not necessarily reduced. This is because swing pricing may increase funds'  capacity for holding illiquid assets without inducing panic runs.</content>

    <title>The Evolution of Talent Allocation into Academia: Institution-Building and Graduates’ Choices during Japan’s Industrialization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Higher technical-education institutions play an important role in training industrial scientists and engineers and generating new technologies. How well they perform this role, however, depends on their ability to recruit and retain talented faculty who have alternative options in industry; moreover, such allocation of talent in academia vs. industry is conditioned by path-dependencies in the evolution of these sectors. We examine the evolution of academia-industry occupational choices and talent allocation across sectors by utilizing unique data on the census of university-educated engineers from the first 40 cohorts since the inception of higher technical education in Japan. We find that academia disproportionately attracted top talent despite an increasing pay gap with industry, which we link to the institution-building process that increased non-monetary attractiveness of academic jobs. To quantitatively examine the evolution of non-pecuniary preferences for academic careers on the supply side, we estimate a dynamic model of occupational choice and find that top graduates from later cohorts, especially those who already showed exceptional talent at early stages of education, were more likely than earlier graduates to value non-pecuniary benefits offered by academia.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present a theory of decisions in which attention to the features of choice options is determined by the decision maker's categorization of the current choice problem in a set of problems she solved in the past. Categorization depends on goal-relevant as well as contextual problem-level features. The model yields systematic heterogeneity in attention and choice in a given problem based on different past experiences, rigidity of choices when categorization does not change despite new data, and discontinuous shifts when changes in bottom-up salient features cause re-categorization. The model unifies major puzzles and framing effects in riskless, statistical, and lottery choice based on heterogenous and unstable mental representations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We model and analyze employer cartels that fix wages by committing to a wage ceiling. The setting is a frictional labor market with large employers that compete for workers via posted wages. Wage fixing reduces competition both inside and outside the cartel, leading to market-wide wage depression. Competition from outside employers disciplines the cartel and hence governs its wage impact and profitability. Consequently, wage-fixing schemes are more likely to emerge and remain stable when the labor market has slack, concentration is high, the span of control is small, product demand is elastic, and firms also collude in the product market. We describe a simple sufficient statistic to gauge the harm caused by a wage-fixing cartel.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a dynamic urban model combining features of quantitative spatial and macro-housing models. It includes multiple locations, forward-looking households, commuting, costly migration, uninsurable income risk, housing tenure choice, and housing frictions. The model operates in continuous time, with shocks and choices occurring at discrete intervals. This ``mixed time'' approach enables efficient computation of steady-state equilibria and transition dynamics, even with thousands of location pairs. Using a model of the San Francisco Bay Area, we show how forward-looking behavior, spatial frictions, and transition dynamics reshape estimated effects of spatially heterogeneous shocks and policies, traditionally studied with static models.</content>

    <title>Long-Run Comparative Statics</title>

    <author>
      <name>David Baqaee &amp; Hannes Malmberg</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What are the long-run effects of permanent changes to the economy? We characterize long-run comparative statics for a broad class of models in terms of expenditure shares, substitution elasticities, and capital supply elasticities. Our key insight is that long-run analysis can be performed using an as-if static economy where capital is treated as an intermediate input subject to endogenous markups. These markups, which measure deviations from the Golden Rule of savings, equal the ratio of capital income to investment. This reframing yields a surprising result: long-run consumption responses follow second-best principles even in efficient economies. In particular, reallocations have first-order effects since the envelope theorem does not apply. Furthermore, sales alone do not summarize industries’ importance for long-run consumption. To show how these points matter in practice, we develop a quantitative model of the world economy to study how markups, tariffs, and productivities affect long-run consumption. The model features input-output linkages, imperfectly elastic capital supply, heterogeneous returns, and endogenous net foreign asset positions. We find large negative first-order effects of tariffs and markups, even when initial tariffs and markups are zero. We also find that the productivities of industries upstream of investment goods have substantially larger long-run consumption effects than their sales shares would suggest.</content>

    <title>Do Temporary Cash Transfers Stimulate the Macroeconomy? Evidence from Four Case Studies</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper re-evaluates the effectiveness of temporary transfers in stimulating the macroeconomy using evidence from four case studies. The rebirth of Keynesian stabilization policy has lingering costs in terms of higher debt paths, so it is important to assess the benefits of these policies. In each case study, I analyze whether the behavior of the aggregate data is consistent with the transfers providing an effective stimulus. Two of the case studies are reviews of evidence from my recent work on the 2001 and 2008 U.S. tax rebates.  The other two case studies are new analyses of temporary transfers in Singapore and Australia.  In all four instances, the evidence suggests that temporary cash transfers to households likely provided little or no stimulus to the macroeconomy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the social construction of race during the United States' Reconstruction Era, a critical juncture between slavery and Jim Crow segregation.  We show that people with the same detailed skin tone, recorded by the Freedman's Bank (1865-1874), were more likely racialized as White or Mulatto by the 1870 Census if they were wealthier or literate.  Our estimates reveal the construction – or rather, reconstruction – of race in a period of unfulfilled potential for social transformation, setting a path for racial segregation and continued racial stratification.  The endogenous historical construction of race also has implications for analyses that compare individuals by race or include race as a control variable.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An influential explanation for global productivity differences is that frontier technologies are adapted to the high-income countries that develop them and "inappropriate" elsewhere. We study this hypothesis in agriculture using data on novel plant varieties, patents, output, and the global range of crop pests and pathogens. Innovation focuses on the environmental conditions of technology leaders, and ecological mismatch with these markets reduces technology transfer and production. Combined with a model, our estimates imply that inappropriate technology explains 15-20% of cross-country agricultural productivity differences and re-shapes the potential consequences of innovation policy, the rise of new technology leaders, and environmental change.</content>

    <title>Measuring the Average Period of Production</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The importance of time in production was emphasized by Classical economists and was at the core of the Austrian capital theory proposed by Böhm-Bawerk and further elaborated by Wicksell, Hicks, Dorfman, and many others. A central concept in this literature is the existence of an ‘average period of production’ which governs the demand for circulating capital associated with a production process. Building on Böhm-Bawerk (1889), we propose a measure of the average period of production as a (weighted) average temporal distance between the time at which a firm employs its inputs and the time at which these inputs deliver finished goods that are sold to consumers. We show that, under stationarity conditions, this measure corresponds to the ratio of a firm’s stock of inventories to the cost of the goods it sells in a given period. Using data from publicly traded companies worldwide, we compute and validate this measure for various industries and countries, and show that, consistent with theory, this measure is lower, the higher the cost of capital faced by firms is.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Paying for college is often a family affair, with both parents and students contributing. We study the effects of college on family finances using administrative data on the universe of federal aid applicants in California linked to credit records. We provide the first comprehensive analysis of how both students and their parents use debt with college attendance and how prices affect those decisions. We start by using an event-study framework to explore how parents’ use of debt and credit outcomes change after their child first submits a federal aid application for college enrollment. While total debt does not change, higher-income parents shift balances from other debt to educational loans. We find that lower-income parents take out more education loans, experience less delinquency on non-educational debt, and see their credit scores rise. We then use discontinuities in eligibility for generous financial aid to test how an exogenous change in the price of college affects parental debt and financial health. We find that parents finance increases in the price of college through educational loans as well as home equity loans. Higher prices increase parental delinquency on debt. The findings highlight an important channel by which college and its rising cost may spill over into the broader financial health of families and economy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a new market design for K-12 school broadband procurement that switched from school-specific bidding to a system that bundled schools into groups. Using an event study approach, we estimate the program reduced internet prices by 37% per Mbps per month while increasing bandwidth by 500%. These benefits occurred by mitigating exposure risk in broadband procurement – the risk that providers win too few contracts to cover fixed infrastructure costs. Using a bounds approach, we show robustness of our estimates and document that participants saved at least as much as their federal subsidies and experienced substantial welfare gains.</content>

    <title>Making the Invisible Visible: The Impact of Revealing Indoor Air Pollution on Behavior and Welfare</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Exposure to ambient air pollution has been shown to be detrimental to human health and productivity, and has motivated many policies to reduce such pollution. However, given that humans spend 90% of their time indoors, it is important to understand the degree of exposure to Indoor Air Pollution (IAP), and, if high, ways to reduce it. We design and implement a field experiment in London that monitors households’ IAP and then randomly reveals their IAP in real-time. At baseline, we find that IAP is worse than ambient air pollution when residents are at home and that for 38% of the time, IAP is above World Health Organization standards. Additionally, we observe a large household income-IAP gradient, larger than the income-ambient pollution gradient, highlighting large income disparities in IAP exposure. During our field experiment, we find that the randomized revelation reduces IAP by 17% (1.9 μg/m³) overall and 34% (5 μg/m³) during occupancy time. We show that the mechanism is households using more natural ventilation as a result of the feedback (i.e., opening up doors and windows). Finally, in terms of welfare, we find that: (i) households have a willingness to pay of £4.8 ($6) for every 1 μg/m ³ reduction in indoor PM2.5; (ii) households have a higher willingness to pay for mitigation than for full information; (iii) households have a price elasticity of IAP monitor demand around -0.75; and (iv) a £1 subsidy for an IAP monitor or an air purifier has an infinite marginal value of public funds, i.e., a Pareto improvement.</content>

    <title>Measuring Work from Home</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Headline estimates for the extent of work from home (WFH) differ widely across U.S. surveys. The differences shrink greatly when we harmonize with respect to the WFH concept, target population, and question design. As of 2025, our preferred estimates say that WFH accounts for a quarter of paid workdays among Americans aged 20-64. The WFH rate is seven percentage points higher for workers with children under eight in the household and about two percentage points higher for women than men. Desired WFH rates exceed actual rates in every major demographic group – more so for women, workers with young children, and less educated workers.</content>

    <title>Knightian Uncertainty and Bayesian Entrepreneurship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the relationship between Knightian uncertainty and Bayesian approaches to entrepreneurship. Using Bewley's formal model of uncertainty and incomplete preferences, it demonstrates that key predictions from Bayesian entrepreneurship remain robust when accounting for Knightian uncertainty, particularly regarding experimentation, venture financing, and strategic choice. The analysis shows that while Knightian uncertainty creates a more challenging decision environment, it maintains consistency with the three pillars of Bayesian entrepreneurship: heterogeneous beliefs, stronger entrepreneurial priors, and Bayesian updating. The paper also explores connections to effectuation theory, finding that formal uncertainty models can bridge different entrepreneurial methodologies.</content>

    <title>Long-Run Consequences of Sanctions on Russia</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the long-run economic consequences of Western sanctions on Russia. Using a new framework for balanced growth path analysis, we find that the long-run declines in consumption are significantly larger when capital stocks are allowed to adjust --- 1.4 times larger for Russia and 2.2 times larger for Eastern Europe. This is contrary to the common intuition that long-run effects should be milder due to greater adjustment opportunities. In our model, Russian long-run consumption falls by 8.5%, Eastern European consumption by 2%, and Western countries' consumption by 0.3% in response to sanctions. The model also reveals important distributional effects: as capital adjusts, Russian real wages fall more than rental prices in the long run. These findings show that accounting for capital adjustment is quantitatively important when analyzing trade sanctions.</content>

    <title>Firstborn Daughters and Family Structure in Sub-Saharan Africa</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does the absence of missing baby girls in sub-Saharan Africa imply a lack of son preference in the region? This paper uncovers systematic gendered effects on family structure and fertility in sub-Saharan Africa. Using data from Demographic and Health Surveys, we show that having a firstborn daughter, rather than a son, significantly influences women’s family dynamics. Women with a female firstborn experience higher long-term marriage rates but are less likely to marry the child’s father when the birth occurs prior to formal union. They also face higher divorce rates and greater likelihood of entering polygamous unions. Despite these marital transitions, they tend to have more children. Our analysis further reveals that having a firstborn daughter is associated with poorer living standards and adverse health outcomes for mothers. To examine the mechanisms driving these patterns, we employ a geographic regression discontinuity design along ancestral ethnic borders separating matrilineal and patrilineal traditions. This approach highlights patrilineality as a key driver, shaping both marriage dynamics and fertility.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage recent advances in NLP to construct measures of workers' task exposure to AI and machine learning technologies over the 2010 to 2023 period that vary across firms and time. Using a theoretical framework that allows for a labor-saving technology to affect worker productivity both directly and indirectly, we show that the impact on wage earnings and employment can be summarized by two statistics. First, labor demand decreases in the average exposure of workers' tasks to AI technologies; second, holding the average exposure constant, labor demand increases in the dispersion of task exposures to AI, as workers shift effort to tasks that are not displaced by AI. Exploiting exogenous variation in our measures based on pre-existing hiring practices across firms, we find empirical support for these predictions, together with a lower demand for skills affected by AI. Overall, we find muted effects of AI on employment due to offsetting effects: highly-exposed occupations experience relatively lower demand compared to less exposed occupations, but the resulting increase in firm productivity increases overall employment across all occupations.</content>

    <title>The U.S. Place-Based Policy Supply Chain</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Place-based policy in the United States comprises a wide range of government programs that are spread across federal, state, and local agencies and that rely on public, private, and nonprofit organizations for policy design and implementation. We document how loosely connected vertical policy supply chains distribute resources from federal and state governments to recipients at the local level. The apparatus is the product of 150 years of policy innovation, both from the top down, with the federal government periodically launching major initiatives whose place-based impacts tend to be long-lived (even if the specific policies are not), and from the bottom up, with state and local actors engineering their own policy solutions, many of which have endured and now constitute modern policy practice. That practice includes not just tax incentives for business investment, the subject of most economic research on place-based policy, but support for community redevelopment, workforce development, small business promotion, technological innovation, and regional planning and strategy. Intermediary organizations that connect government agencies to local recipients are central to resource delivery. Because they tend to be created, funded, and (or) run by non-state actors, there appears to be wide geographic variation in organizational capacity for place-based policy. Understanding the causes and consequences of that variation is needed for a full accounting of how place-based policy works in the U.S.</content>

    <title>Misperceptions of Nonlinear Budget Sets: Evidence from Administrative Tax Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Budget set kinks are much studied in economics, including in the context of “bunching” estimators that assume individuals react to the true marginal tax rate. We document that individuals disproportionately “left-bunch” below kinks in the context of the Social Security Earnings Test where incentives from its actuarial adjustments should instead push many rational agents to bunch above the kink. We show that the left bunching in this case cannot be explained through standard, rational reactions to the incentives. We demonstrate that these patterns represent the first empirical evidence consistent with “spotlighting,” wherein individuals misperceive the local marginal tax rates as applying throughout the tax schedule and therefore treat the kink as a notch. In the context of the Earnings Test, this misperception provides an explanation for why literature has found large earnings responses despite the fact that the Earnings Test typically creates weak incentives for rational agents to adjust earnings. More generally, if individuals perceive kinks as notches, then elasticities estimated from bunching at kinks where this misperception may be at play may be significantly over-estimated.</content>
