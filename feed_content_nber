    <title>Do Time-Constraints Matter? How, Why, and For Whom?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Exams are designed to rank students objectively by their abilities, including elements such as time limits, the number and difficulty of questions, and negative marking policies. Using data from a lab-in-field experiment, we develop and estimate a model of student behavior in multiple-choice exams that incorporates the effects of time constraints and use it to conduct policy analyses for designing more efficient exams in sorting students. We find that additional time benefits men more than women. Our estimated model shows that this is driven by gender differences in the signal production function for the correct answers. Time has a smaller impact on women, while ability and difficulty play a larger role. Risk aversion, in contrast to what is suggested in the literature, does not differ significantly by gender, and confidence rises with more time. Our policy experiments find that exams more effectively rank students when ranking is gender-specific and that time pressure, question difficulty, and student ability have non-monotonic effects on sorting.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a novel dataset of U.S. buyout and VC investments, we study the informativeness of fund managers’ interim valuation reports about portfolio companies on final outcomes. We find that when investors assess the performance of individual portfolio companies, they can do better than just relying on the most recent reported valuation. The history of reported valuations is also informative. Investments with greater past staleness or more frequent markdowns tend to perform more poorly in the future than other investments. We also find that the timing of an investment’s exit is predictable. Moreover, the combined knowledge of interim realized and unrealized returns, past staleness, and past markdown frequency can help predict whether an investment will end up in the left or right tail of all investments. These predictions are informative as early as the first year of the investment.</content>

    <title>Long-Run Effects of Trade Wars</title>
    <updated>2025-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This short note shows that accounting for capital adjustment is critical when analyzing the long-run effects of trade wars on real wages and consumption. The reason is that trade wars increase the relative price between investment goods and labor by taxing imported investment goods and their inputs. This price shift depresses capital demand, shrinks the long-run capital stock, and pushes down consumption and real wages compared to scenarios when capital is fixed. We illustrate this mechanism by studying recent US tariffs using a dynamic quantitative trade model. When the capital stock is allowed to adjust, long-run consumption and wage responses are both larger and more negative. With capital adjustment, U.S. consumption can fall by 2.6%, compared to 0.6% when capital is held fixed, as in a static model. That is, capital stock adjustment emerges as a dominant driver of long-run outcomes, more important than the standard mechanisms from static trade models — terms-of-trade effects and mis- allocation of production across countries.</content>

    <title>The Rise of Absorptive Research in Corporate America: 1945-1980</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the post-World War II “Golden Age” of American corporate research from 1945 to 1980, using multiple indicators of corporate research activity. We use an ensemble learning approach to classify firms as either Science Leaders, Absorbers or Followers. Our analysis reveals that only a small fraction of firms, whom we call Leaders, invest in internal research that is on the scientific frontier, with the objective to generate breakthrough inventions. Absorbers invest in research principally to absorb external scientific discoveries to fuel their inventive activity. Followers typically generate incremental innovations, using older scientific knowledge. Consistent with this, we find Leaders were more likely to be at the technological frontier, enjoy greater market power, and benefit from government procurement contracts. As universities and startups began to commercialize academic discoveries, the need for “absorptive corporate labs” declined. The shift ultimately transformed the American innovation landscape, deepening the division of innovative labor between universities, startups, and incumbent corporations, with only a select group of Leader firms continuing to invest in basic science.</content>

    <title>The Political Economy of Firm Networks: CEO Ideology and Global Trade</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how the political ideology of corporate leaders shapes cross-border firm networks. Exploiting changes in ideological alignment between U.S. firm CEOs and foreign governments around close foreign elections, we show that U.S. firms are more likely to terminate trade relationships with countries led by governments whose ideology becomes more distant from that of their CEOs. The impact is concentrated among CEOs holding strong political views, and is particularly pronounced for shorter trade relationships, suggesting ideological alignment is more relevant in more flexible and substitutable connections. Our findings highlight the role of ideology in shaping the formation and persistence of international firm networks.</content>

    <title>The Invention of Corporate Governance</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The analysis of corporate governance begins with a central feature of modern capitalism—the separation of ownership and control in large corporations—first empirically documented by Berle and Means (1932). Such separation entails several agency problems reflecting conflicts between managers and shareholders, such as self-dealing by managers, low effort, consumption of perquisites, and excessive growth and diversification. Berle and Means saw self-dealing as the central agency problem and stressed the law as the fundamental mechanism of addressing it. Jensen and Meckling (1976) considered the consumption of perquisites and emphasized private mechanisms, such as financial incentives for managers, to counter wasteful perks. Jensen (1986) instead focused on excessive growth and diversification, which led him to count on leverage and takeovers. The combination of public corporate governance mechanisms, mostly the law, and market governance shaped both theory and practice.</content>

    <title>From Distraction to Dedication: Commitment and Incentives Against Phone Use in the Classroom</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Phone usage in the classroom has been linked to worsened academic outcomes. We present findings from a field experiment conducted at a large public university in partnership with an app marketed as a soft commitment device that provides incentives to reduce phone use in the classroom. We find that app usage led to improvements in classroom focus, attendance, and overall academic satisfaction. Analysis of time spent outside the classroom suggests a potential substitution effect: students using the app allocated less time to study, particularly on campus. Overall, though statistically insignificant, we find improvements in transcript grades associated with app usage.</content>

    <title>Did War Mobilization Cause Aggregate and Regional Growth?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The participation of the United States in World War II led to a substantial mobilization of domestic resources to produce the materiel used on the battlefields of Europe and in the Pacific. We produce new estimates for the impact of war mobilization on long-run economic growth and regional development in the United States over the postwar period. Guided by an economic geography model, we interpret our estimates as the direct effect of mobilization on local productivity. The findings suggest the largest likely aggregate welfare impact was modest, although there is variation across region. In addition, industrial mobilization contributed to manufacturing growth relatively more in the Northeast and Midwest, and less in the South and West.</content>

    <title>Fiscal Policy as a Stabilization Tool. The Case for Quasi-Automatic Stabilizers, With an Application to the VAT</title>
    <updated>2025-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Olivier J. Blanchard</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most of the focus of recent stabilization policy research and practice has been on monetary rather than fiscal policy. This paper explores how, given the limits on monetary policy, fiscal policy could play a larger role. It explores the use of quasi-automatic stabilizers, i.e. changes in taxes or transfers triggered by an aggregate variable. It discusses design issues, in particular how to make such stabilizers truly debt neutral, and what aggregate variable to use as a trigger. It then focuses on a specific stabilizer, a variable VAT rate. It shows its effect in a minimalist NK model, and then discusses a number of analytical issues, both within and out of the minimalist model, such as the implications for inflation, the choice of the tax base, the implications of liquidity constraints, the implication of anticipation effects. It ends by reviewing the empirical evidence on passthrough of VAT changes, and the effects on demand of VAT changes, permanent or temporary.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the effect of social media deactivation on users’ emotional state in two large randomized experiments before the 2020 U.S. election. People who deactivated Facebook for the six weeks before the election reported a 0.060 standard deviation improvement in an index of happiness, depression, and anxiety, relative to controls who deactivated for just the first of those six weeks. People who deactivated Instagram for those six weeks reported a 0.041 standard deviation improvement relative to controls. Exploratory analysis suggests the Facebook effect is driven by people over 35, while the Instagram effect is driven by women under 25.</content>

    <title>A Theory of Supply Function Choice and Aggregate Supply</title>
    <updated>2025-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Modern theories of aggregate supply are built on the foundation that firms set prices and commit to producing whatever the market demands. We remove this strategic restriction and allow firms to choose supply functions, mappings that describe the prices charged at each quantity of production. Theoretically, we characterize firms’ optimal supply function choices in general equilibrium and study the resulting implications for aggregate supply. Aggregate supply flattens under lower inflation uncertainty, higher idiosyncratic demand uncertainty, and less elastic demand. Quantitatively, our theory can rationalize the flattening of aggregate supply during the Great Moderation and steepening during the 1970s and 2020s.</content>

    <title>How Tariffs Affect Trade Deficits</title>

      <name>Arnaud Costinot ⓡ Iván Werning</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the positive (not normative) effect of a permanent import tariff on trade deficits. We consider a two-period trade model with general preferences and technology. We first develop an aggregation result showing one can work with induced preferences over aggregate imports and exports. This simplifies the analysis considerably. Our main result provides a sufficient statistic to evaluate the impact of tariffs around free trade: tariffs reduce trade deficits if the Engel curves for aggregate imports and exports are convex. Convexity is more likely when goods, at the micro-level, shift between being imported, non-traded, or exported. If this extensive margin is inactive and Engel curves are linear, then a permanent tariff is neutral.</content>

    <title>The Law and Economics of Lawyers: Evidence from the Revolving Door in China’s Judicial System</title>
    <updated>2025-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how power lawyers shape judicial and economic outcomes by studying the “revolving door” between judges and lawyers in China’s judicial system—namely, former judges who quit the bench to practice law. In otherwise identical lawsuits, revolving-door lawyers deliver 8−23% higher win rate for their clients. Their performance in home versus away courts suggests these gains stem from both “know how” and “know who.” We extend the theoretical framework of Dewatripont and Tirole (1999) to show that revolving-door lawyers create countervailing forces in society: they enhance judicial decision-making through evidence and reasoning, but also exploit strategic arguments and connections to bias outcomes in favor of their clients. We estimate a structural model of the judicial process to quantify these trade-offs and find that increasing the supply of power lawyers can have a non-monotonic effect on equilibrium judicial quality.</content>

    <title>Reducing Nutritional Disparities Through Targeted Pricing: Evidence from a Large Restaurant Chain</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nutritional disparities across socioeconomic groups contribute to health inequality in the U.S. This paper studies the role of heterogeneous consumer preferences in food choices and explores pricing policies that can promote healthier eating among disadvantaged consumers. Using detailed transaction-level data from a large fast-food restaurant chain, we show that consumers in disadvantaged neighborhoods tend to choose less healthy, higher-calorie items. We estimate a mixed logit discrete choice model to identify consumer preference heterogeneity across demographic groups. Lower-SES consumers display higher price sensitivity across items with varying nutritional quality and show flexibility in substituting between healthy and less healthy options. Counterfactual simulations show that modest, targeted price adjustments in disadvantaged neighborhoods can be an effective tool to reduce nutritional disparities across neighborhoods, with little impact on restaurant revenue or profits.</content>

    <title>Firm Presence, Pollution, and Agglomeration: Evidence from a Randomized Environmental Place-Based Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firm location decisions are a key managerial choice, usually optimized over factors like proximity to customers or  suppliers. These decisions may also impose externalities on the environment, and on other firms due to competitive or agglomerative forces. The inherent endogeneity of location decisions makes estimating the impact of firm presence difficult. In this paper, we study an environmental  place-based policy that randomly moved over 20,000 small firms  in New Delhi to industrial areas outside the city over several years. We find that a reduction in firm presence improves air quality, reducing industrial pollution by 8% for the average neighborhood. However, industrial relocation is costly for firms, significantly increasing the probability of firm exit. We combine the exogenous assignment of firms to industrial plots with a model of firms playing a game of incomplete information to estimate the effect of neighborhood composition on firm survival through Marshallian agglomeration forces. We find that proximity to neighboring firms with input-output linkages increases the likelihood of firm survival, and taking these into account while determining firm placement in industrial areas would have halved the costs imposed on firms by the policy. These results provide causal evidence on the trade-offs between firm presence and environmental quality, and show that firm spillovers can be a useful force to minimize the costs on regulated firms.</content>

    <title>Option Value Neglect: Evidence from Centralized College Admission</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sequential choices are ubiquitous in daily life, yet making optimal decisions in such settings—where properly accounting for option value is crucial—can be challenging. This paper provides field experimental evidence on the neglect of option value in high-stakes decisions and quantifies the associated welfare consequences. We study a centralized college admissions system where students submit brief preference lists. Although option value should encourage riskier top choices, many students are overly cautious and fail to include safer lower-ranked options. We argue that directed cognition—making myopic decisions while ignoring the value of subsequent options—explains this behavior. An in-field experiment targeting a key framing-based prediction shows that about 50% of applicants exhibit this pattern, especially among disadvantaged students. Counterfactual analysis suggests that de-biasing interventions could significantly reduce outcome gaps and improve overall efficiency.</content>

    <title>The Global Macro Database: A New International Macroeconomic Dataset</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Global Macro Database is an open-source, continuously updated dataset of macroeconomic statistics that unifies and extends existing resources. By harmonizing and integrating data from 32 major contemporary sources—including the IMF, World Bank, and OECD—with historical records from 78 additional datasets, we construct comprehensive annual time series for 46 variables across 243 countries. This database covers global macroeconomic trends from the origins of modern data collection to projected estimates for 2030. Using this extensive database, we study the long-run output losses of financial crises and global temperature shocks, two applications in which historical time series are a crucial input. Our findings show that financial crises are associated with statistically detectable contractions in real GDP for five decades into the future, which are considerably larger than previously estimated. Temperature shocks also predict real GDP contractions up to 30 years ahead, especially in emerging economies.</content>

    <title>Skewed Fluctuations and Propagation Through Production Networks</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Skewness is a prevalent feature of macroeconomic time series and may arise exogenously because shocks are asymmetrically distributed, or endogenously, as shocks propagate through production networks. Previous theoretical work often studies these two possibilities in isolation. We nest all possible sources of skewness in a model where output has a network, a common, and an idiosyncratic component. In this model, skewness can arise not only from the three components, but also from coskewness due to the higher order covariation between components. An analysis of output growth in 43 U.S. sectors shows that coskewness is a key source of asymmetry in the data and constitutes a connectivity channel not previously explored. To help interpret our results, we construct and estimate a micro-founded multi-sector general equilibrium model and show that it can generate skewness and coskewness consistent with the data.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this Handbook chapter, I examine how integrating ethnographic and folklore records has shaped research on culture and economics in the 21st century. Advances in text analysis techniques and the incorporation of historical and satellite data have transformed the field. I explore how George Peter Murdock's ethnographic contributions and Yuri Berezkin's seminal folklore motif index have been utilized to shed light on the roots of comparative development. I conclude by proposing a methodology for leveraging Large Language Models to extract cultural insights from folklore motifs, demonstrating how ancestral narratives can complement ethnographic records and offer valuable perspectives on societal norms and the historical forces shaping economic behavior today.</content>

    <title>Health Impacts of Federal Pandemic Aid to State and Local Governments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented levels of federal transfers to state and local governments. Did this funding impact population health? To answer this question, we leverage the fact that U.S. states that enjoy excess representation in Congress received substantially more fiscal assistance than did relatively underrepresented states. We find that the aid driven by excess representation had substantial impacts on population health. For each $1,000 increase in federal fiscal aid per state resident, we estimate that states experienced 38 fewer deaths from all causes per 100,000 residents from 2020 through 2022, of which 2/3 came from reductions in COVID-19 mortality. We estimate that the last $331 billion in federal pandemic aid, which corresponds with  our in-sample variation, generated $591 billion in value through life years saved. Additional aid also reduced rates of COVID-19 related hospitalizations and emergency room visits, though not in the total number of positive cases detected. Plausible mechanisms for these improved outcomes include higher rates of COVID-19 vaccination, which plausibly account for nearly half of the mortality reductions we observe, and higher rates of COVID-19 testing. Medicaid enrollments and hospital capacity do not appear to play substantial mediating roles. Our robustness analyses provide evidence that the effects we estimate cannot be explained by pre-existing mortality trends, by the pandemic's differential impacts on relatively dense vs. rural areas, or by the pandemic's differential impacts on populations with more elderly individuals or with higher prevalence of chronic conditions. The mortality impacts we estimate were substantially greater for non-Hispanic Black Americans than for non-Hispanic White Americans, such that federal funds are associated with a reduction in population-wide health disparities over the course of the pandemic.</content>

    <title>Field Choice, Skill Specificity, and Labor Market Disruptions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We argue that college students’ field-of-study choices significantly influence how economies respond to labor market disruptions. To do so, we develop and estimate a framework featuring forward-looking students who choose a field of study when entering college, and subsequently make decisions over occupations after graduating and entering the labor market. Different fields endow workers with distinct comparative advantages and varying costs associated with switching occupations. Simulating both a trade war and wide scale adoption of AI, we use our model to make three points. First, relative to models that ignore how new cohorts adjust their field-of-study choices, our framework predicts larger aggregate income responses and greater distributional differences. Second, policies that enhance flexibility in field-of-study decisions—such as relaxing capacity constraints in high-demand programs—raise aggregate output. Finally, these policies also lessen the adverse distributional consequences of shocks, by affording more opportunities to students with lower earnings potential.</content>

    <title>Regulating Out-of-Network Hospital Payments: Disagreement Payoffs, Negotiated Prices, and Access</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent policy proposals seek to regulate out-of-network hospital prices. We study how such regulation affects equilibrium prices, network formation, and hospital exit. We estimate a structural model of insurer-hospital bargaining that allows for out-of-network transactions between non-contracting parties. These transactions generate a notion of exit by rendering hospitals unprofitable under some regulations. Estimation relies on a novel measure of out-of-network prices. We find that reducing out-of-network prices would also lower negotiated prices, but potentially at the cost of narrower hospital networks. Aggressive regulation could induce substantial hospital exit, but only under the restrictive assumption that negotiators cannot anticipate the exits.</content>

    <title>The Macroeconomics of Tariff Shocks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the short-run effects of import tariffs on GDP and the trade balance in an open-economy New Keynesian model with intermediate input trade. We find that temporary tariffs cause a recession whenever the import elasticity is below an openness-weighted average of the export elasticity and the intertemporal substitution elasticity. We argue this condition is likely satisfied in practice because durable goods generate great scope for intertemporal substitution, and because it is easier to lose competitiveness on the global market than to substitute between home and foreign goods. Unilateral tariffs do tend to improve the trade balance, but when other countries retaliate the trade balance worsens and the recession deepens. Taking into account the recessionary effect of tariffs dramatically brings down the optimal unilateral tariff level derived in standard trade theory.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Amid rising global interest in state interventions, this paper examines how China’s infrastructure investments—a key macroeconomic policy tool—affect firm productivity. We focus on a policy that encourages regional governments to improve market conditions for private enterprises. Our analysis shows that a better market environment amplifies infrastructure investment spillovers. However, the overall impact remains neutral or negative despite greater gains in industries with improved market access. These findings highlight the complex interplay between state intervention and market forces, raising concerns about the effectiveness of infrastructure investments in sustaining growth, especially in regions with weak market institutions.</content>

    <title>Optimal Second-best Menu Design: Evidence from Residential Electricity Plans</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Utilities increasingly sell electricity using complex menus of time-constant and time-varying price schedules. We study how to design such a menu to maximize social welfare in a second best environment where the marginal private and external costs of generating electricity vary over time, institutional constraints prevent mandating time-varying pricing, and consumer behavior is distorted by frictions. We develop a model of plan choice, consumption, and intertemporal substitution with time-varying marginal social costs, and estimate it using administrative data from a large utility. We provide evidence of substantial intertemporal substitution in response to time-varying price incentives, and selection across plans based on multidimensional heterogeneity. While the current menu’s time-varying plans substantially shift consumption from high-price to low-price hours, we find that they reduce social welfare. This loss is mitigated by information frictions. We show how to redesign the menu to simultaneously improve outcomes for consumers, the utility, and the environment.</content>

    <title>An Anatomy of U.S. Establishments' Trade Linkages in Global Value Chains</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Global value chains (GVC) are a pervasive feature of modern production, but they are hard to measure. Using confidential microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau, we develop novel measures of the linkages between U.S. manufacturing establishments’ imports and exports. We document three new GVC patterns. First, for every dollar of exports, imported inputs represent 13 cents in 2002 and 20 cents by 2017, substantially higher than what aggregate data suggests. Second, we find strong complementarities between input and output markets reflected in “round-trip” trade linkages where an establishment sources inputs from and exports output to the same country. Third, we find a strong positive association between regional trade agreements and GVC trade flows. The aggregate data used to build global input-output tables requires proportionality assumptions that we find mute these relationships. Finally, with a simple model, we show that the round-trip results are consistent with a notion of firm and country-specific fixed costs that are at least partially common between sourcing (imports) and foreign sales (exports).</content>

    <title>The Global Effects of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) policies, as currently being implemented by the EU and UK. Policy discussions have cited three motivations and one concern. CBAMs can improve domestic competitiveness in regulated markets, reduce emissions leakage to unregulated markets, and encourage other countries to tax carbon. But CBAMs may particularly disadvantage lower-income trading partners. We evaluate these forces with a quantitative equilibrium model and plant-level data on aluminum and steel production worldwide. Our data cover the most emissions-intensive and heavily traded sectors targeted in the first phase of EU and UK implementation. We find that CBAMs can effectively boost competitiveness, curb leakage, and encourage regulation, while also avoiding disproportionate impacts on lower-income countries.</content>

    <title>Screening Through Soft Spending Limits: Evidence from the Medicare Therapy Cap</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Governments and firms often employ soft spending limits to restrict overspending while still allowing exceptions on a case-by-case basis. This paper studies a Medicare policy which capped per-patient physical therapy spending, with exceptions for patients with documented medical need.  The cap reduced spending by 8 percent without harming patient health, with the targeting improvements driven by Medicare discretion in granting exceptions rather than improved provider screening. However, the documentation requirement also introduced horizontal inequity: conditional on need, lower-income and minority patients were more likely to be screened out, as they tended to see providers with poorer documentation practices.</content>

    <title>Local Energy Access and Industry Specialization: Evidence from World War II Emergency Pipelines</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does improving access to the supply of energy affect regional specialization in manufacturing? We evaluate the long-run employment impacts of pipelines constructed by the U.S. government during World War II to transport oil and gas from the oil fields of the Southwest to wartime industrial producers in the Northeast. The pipelines were built rapidly to connect end points along a direct path that minimized use of scarce construction materials. Postwar they were converted to supply en route customers, giving counties close to the pipelines access to a cheap and plentiful source of energy. Between 1940 and 1950, counties with better access to pipeline gas had larger increases in their share of employment in energy-intensive industries. These impacts persisted to the mid-1980s for all energy-intensive industries and to the late 1990s for the subset of industries intensive in the direct use of electricity, despite the disruptive effects of the 1970s energy crisis. Our findings are relevant for understanding energy-related path dependence in local economic development patterns and how government intervention in energy markets affects industry location in the short and long run.</content>

    <title>Protection for Whom? The Political Economy of Protective Labor Laws for Women</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;During the first half of the twentieth century, many US states enacted laws restricting women's labor market opportunities, including maximum hours restrictions, minimum wage laws, and night-shift bans. The era of so-called protective labor laws came to an end in the 1960s as a result of civil rights reforms. In this paper, we investigate the political economy behind the rise and fall of these laws. We argue that the main driver behind protective labor laws was men's desire to shield themselves from labor market competition. We spell out the mechanism through a politico-economic model in which singles and couples work in different sectors and vote on protective legislation. Restrictions are supported by single men and couples with male sole earners who compete with women for jobs. We show that the theory's predictions for when protective legislation will be introduced are well supported by US state-level evidence.</content>

    <title>Taming Cycles: China’s Growth Targets and Macroeconomic Management</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;China’s hybrid economy blends state planning with market mechanisms, using annual economic targets to guide development and macroeconomic management to ensure their achievement. Local governments set ambitious growth targets to align with central mandates and incentivize subordinates, leading to asymmetric adjustments: targets rise rapidly during booms but decline sluggishly during slowdowns. This dynamic has heightened pressure on local governments to intervene in the economy, particularly after 2010. Our analysis shows that when a region falls short of its growth target, it increases infrastructure investment, land sales, and local government debt to close the gap. Notably, during the relatively stable period of 2011–2019, overly optimistic targets contributed an additional 14.0% of GDP to local government debt. While these interventions helped smooth cyclical fluctuations and moderated the trend of GDP deceleration, they also eroded GDP growth’s reliability as an economic indicator, weakening its correlation with corporate revenue, household demand, and TFP gains.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;At the onset of COVID-19, U.S. labor-force participation dropped by about 3 percentage points and remained below pre-pandemic levels three years later. Recovery varied across states, with slower rebounds in those more affected by the pre-pandemic opioid crisis, as measured by age-adjusted opioid overdose death rates. An event study shows that a one-standard-deviation increase in pre-COVID opioid death rates corresponds to a 0.9 percentage point decline in post-COVID labor participation. The result is not driven by differences in overall health between states. The effect of prior opioid exposure had a more significant impact on individuals without a college degree. The slow recovery in states with more opioid exposure was characterized by an increase in individuals who are not in the labor force due to disability.</content>

    <title>Using Multiple Outcomes to Adjust Standard Errors for Spatial Correlation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Empirical research in economics often examines the behavior of agents located in a geographic space. In such cases, statistical inference is complicated by the interdependence of economic outcomes across locations. A common approach to account for this dependence is to cluster standard errors based on a predefined geographic partition. A second strategy is to model dependence in terms of the distance between units. Dependence, however, does not necessarily stop at borders and is typically not determined by distance alone. This paper introduces a method that leverages observations of multiple outcomes to adjust standard errors for cross-sectional dependence. Specifically, a researcher, while interested in a particular outcome variable, often observes dozens of other variables for the same units. We show that these outcomes can be used to estimate dependence under the assumption that the cross-sectional correlation structure is shared across outcomes. We develop a procedure, which we call Thresholding Multiple Outcomes (TMO), that uses this estimate to adjust standard errors in a given regression setting. We show that adjustments of this form can lead to sizable reductions in the bias of standard errors in calibrated U.S. county-level regressions. Re-analyzing nine recent papers, we find that the proposed correction can make a substantial difference in practice.</content>

    <title>Do Transfer Pricing Reforms Lead to a Boom in Tax Consultants?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The OECD has promoted the adoption of internationally standardized transfer pricing rules to curb profit shifting for tax avoidance by multinational firms. Bustos et al. (2023) analyzed a large reform in Chile based on these OECD standards and found that it led to a surge in tax advisory services. This paper investigates the external validity of this finding. Combining employment history data with information on countries’ strictness of transfer pricing regulations over time, we analyze the effect for four countries: Chile, Colombia, Spain, and Uruguay. Event-study difference-in-differences analysis shows that reforms led to substantial increase in transfer pricing consultants in most cases. The effect is larger when the reform is stronger and when a country has a lower level of pre-treatment transfer pricing strictness or of transfer pricing consultants.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study disparities in liver transplant allocation when innovation alleviates the scarcity of organs. When direct-acting antivirals for Hepatitis C (HCV) reduced HCV+ liver demand, we show a disproportionate increase in White HCV- liver transplants (56.6%) relative to Black HCV- transplants (11.9%). The time to transplant decreased (31.1%), and the transplant rate increased (19.5pp), only for White HCV- patients. Our results are surprising because liver health is the primary determinant of transplant priority and marginal White patients were of better liver health. We show more similar gains when we focus on privately insured patients and/or areas with more Black patients.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a model to study when an intermediate action can serve as a “stepping stone” that enables the elimination of a harmful norm. While the intermediate action may facilitate the first “step”, it may also become a new norm. We derive intuitive conditions for stepping stones, which depend on the relative size of social penalties and intrinsic utility benefits. We propose an econometric approach to testing whether an intermediate action is a stepping stone, and apply it to original data on female genital cutting in Somalia. The analysis shows that the intermediate action may become the new norm.</content>

    <title>Trends in Work Capacity in the US Population: Are Recent Cohorts in Worse Health?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The growth of longevity in the U.S. and other countries has increased interest in raising the age of eligibility for public retirement benefits. The consequences of this policy depend on the health of the older adult population overall and by socioeconomic group. In this paper, we estimate how multiple dimensions of non-fatal health in older adults evolve over time and across cohorts – physical functioning, mental health, pain, and cognition. Our sample is individuals in the Health and Retirement Study who are aged 51 to 54 at baseline and are followed for up to two decades. We find that limitations in most domains have increased for younger cohorts, especially pain and cognitive impairment. People are more impaired in their 50s, where such impairment used to occur in one’s 60s. However, this appears to be a speeding up of impairment more than a long-term increase. Among people in their late 60s, health for later cohorts is similar to health for earlier cohorts. To evaluate the implications of these trends, we simulate the work capacity of adults just before reaching age 65 based on the health status of people at this age and the relationship between health and the labor force outcomes of younger people. Overall health among those age 62 to 64 remains high, despite impairment striking at younger ages. However, among people without high school degrees, less than half are predicted to have the capacity to work full time by age 62 to 64, and over a quarter are predicted to be receiving SSDI.</content>

    <title>Analyzing the Effects of Occupational Licensing on Earnings Inequality in the United States</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is a consensus that there is an earnings premium for licensed workers relative to unlicensed workers. However, little is known about how occupational licensing affects earnings inequality. In this paper, we study dynamic, heterogeneous earnings effects of occupational licensing and draw implications for earnings inequality in the United States. First, we find that the earnings gap between workers in licensed occupations and those in unlicensed occupations with similar characteristics (“licensing premium”) increased slightly during the 1983–2019 period. Second, we find that the licensing premium for workers in high paying occupations significantly increased, which is not the case for workers in lower paying occupations. The finding is consistent with growing demands for skills over the past decades, given the more rigorous licensing requirements for high-skilled occupations. As a result, earnings inequality among workers in licensed occupations increased. Third, we document that the licensing premium for female workers and workers without a college education declined relative to male workers and college graduates. Taken together, our findings suggest that occupational licensing is associated with widening earnings inequality in the United States during the 1983–2019 period.</content>

    <title>Place Based Economic Development and Tribal Casinos</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Tribal lands in the U.S. have historically experienced some of the worst economic conditions in the nation. We review some existing research on the effect of American Indian tribal casinos on various measures of local economic development. This is an industry that began in the early 1990s and currently generates more than $40 billion annually. We also review the state of the literature on the effects of casino operations on communities in or adjacent to tribal areas. Using a new dataset linking individual and enterprise-level data longitudinally, this study examines the industry- and location-specific impacts of tribal casino operations. We focus in particular on the employment of American Indians. We document positive flows from unemployment and non-casino geographies to work in sectors related to casino operations. Tribal casinos differ from other standard place-based economic development projects in that they are focused on a single industry; we discuss these differences and note that some of the positive spillover effects may be similar to other, more standard place-based policies. Finally, we discuss additional and open-ended questions for future research on this topic.</content>

    <title>Tariff Wars and Net Foreign Assets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This note addresses whether and when a trade war that imposes balanced trade (or even zero trade) can be consistent with initial non-zero net foreign asset positions. Using a bilateral trade model, we exploit insights from the classic literature on the Transfer Problem to characterize when gross asset or liability positions and tariff policies generate an endogenous terms-of-trade effect that ensures the value of assets and liabilities balance. As long as gross positions denominated in different goods differ in sign, there exists a continuum of bilateral tariff policies that ensure balanced  trade and that satisfy the contractual financial obligations. If the new terms-of-trade do not reverse the initial direction of trade, balanced trade is consistent with non-zero exports and imports. In general, high enough bilateral tariffs lead to an autarkic outcome where no trade occurs and the net foreign asset positions rebalance to zero.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the determinants of poor mental health among students at an elite private institution. Survey measures of well-being have declined significantly over the last decade for both high school students and those of college age. This is an international phenomenon that appears to have started in the US around 2013 and that was not caused by but was exacerbated by COVID and the associated lockdowns. We focus on elite and non-elite institutions and examine Dartmouth as a special case. Dartmouth ranks well compared to other institutions. However, around a quarter of Dartmouth students (26%) report they suffer from moderate to severe depression and 22% that they suffer from moderate, to severe, anxiety and 10% say they contemplated suicide. Student’s wellbeing appears to be impacted negatively by stress over finances. We find broad patterns in the data, that ill-being is higher among females, those who engage in little exercise, have low GPAs, are not athletes nor in academic clubs nor religious organizations, reside in fraternity housing or are on financial aid.</content>

    <title>Bureaucratic Incentives and Effectiveness of the One Child Policy in China</title>
    <updated>2025-05-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;China’s total fertility rate declined very little following implementation of the One Child Policy (OCP) in 1979/1980, but then fell sharply, by more than one-third, during the early 1990s. In this paper, we propose that strengthening bureaucratic incentives under the “One Vote Veto” (OVV) policy, which strictly prohibited career promotion for adherence failure, was necessary for more “effective” implementation of the OCP—and for its delayed impact on fertility. We use provincial variation in OVV implementation to estimate event study regression inputs needed to build actual and counterfactual sequential multi-decrement fertility life tables, finding that the policy explains 46% of China’s total fertility rate decline during the 1990s, driving it below replacement level. Use of intrauterine devices (IUDs, the most prevalent form of modern contraception in China) that was “recommended” by party officials increased by 133% under the policy, a relative increase more than four times as large as the increase in “voluntary” use. Overall, our paper suggests that population policy made a larger contribution to low fertility in China than suggested by past research. More generally, our paper highlights the central role of aligning bureaucratic incentives with public policy objectives, even in a centrally-planned economy like China’s.</content>

    <title>Putting US Fiscal Policy on a Sustainable Path</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Even allowing for substantial uncertainty regarding projections, current US fiscal policies are almost certainly unsustainable. Therefore, policymakers must decide when and in what ways to change policies. Changing policies sooner rather than later would put debt on a lower trajectory and thereby increase national savings and provide insurance against adverse developments by expanding fiscal space, protecting against a persistent shortfall in economic growth, and reducing the chance of a fiscal crisis. Yet, the probability of a near-term fiscal crisis is difficult to assess: Yields on Treasury debt are within their range of the past few decades, which suggests that investors are not that worried about the fiscal outlook—but debt and deficits are at nearly unprecedented levels, and experience shows that investors’ confidence in a government’s fiscal management can deteriorate quickly.</content>

    <title>How Much Can Families Afford to Pay for College?</title>
    <updated>2025-05-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies families’ capacity to pay for college in the United States, focusing on changes over time and differences by race and socioeconomic status. I use data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) to document changes over time in the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The results suggest that the EFC has been rising over time, and that this has been driven primarily by families in the upper quartile of the income distribution. I then use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to calculate alternative measures of the ability to pay for college. I find that it is possible to alter the distribution of who pays what amount by changing details of the EFC calculation, but the extent of this depends on details of the implementation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine nonpecuniary preferences across a broad set of corporate actions using a representative sample of the U.S. population. Our core findings, based on large-scale online surveys, are that (i) self-reported nonpecuniary concerns are large both for stock market investors and non-investors; (ii) concerns about the treatment of workers and CEO pay rank highest—higher than concerns about workforce diversity and fossil energy usage; (iii) moral universalism emerges as an important driver of nonpecuniary preferences. Combined, our findings provide new evidence on the importance of moral concerns as a key determinant of nonpecuniary preferences over corporate actions.</content>

    <title>The Power of Persuasion: Causal Effects of Household Communication on Women's Employment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In many economic settings, agents lack decision rights but provide input. Intra-household decision-making in contexts with restrictive gender norms is one important example; wives often lack final say over decisions but still give input. Their ability to communicate persuasively while providing input could sway decisions in their favor. We conduct a field experiment in rural India to test whether an effective communication training among married women impacts their labor supply, the most common topic of intra-household disagreement in the sample. The treatment shifted women's communication styles towards the techniques taught in the training. We find positive effects on labor supply and earnings but, consistent with theory, only for women who at baseline were more interested than their husbands in the women working. These effects persist to at least one year following the treatment, leading to a nearly 60% increase in earnings over this period. Mechanisms analyses suggest the changes in labor supply are not due to shifts in bargaining power but rather come from women changing their husbands' preferences about female employment.</content>

    <title>The Myth of U.S. Dollar Dominance in Japanese Exports: New Evidence from Japanese Customs Level Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While Japanese exports are generally considered invoiced mainly in U.S. dollars (USD), this study presents contrary evidence that most Japanese firms choose yen-invoiced exports. Surprisingly, only the top one percent of firms in size tend to choose USD-invoiced exports, based on the Japan Customs export declaration data that was newly made available to researchers. By conducting fixed-effect panel estimation using the granular Japan Customs transaction data, combined with the most comprehensive firm-level data compiled by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), we demonstrate that the firm size and the intra-firm export share significantly reduce yen-invoiced exports. Smaller firms with few overseas subsidiaries tend to choose yen-invoiced exports to avoid foreign exchange risk. In contrast, larger firms efficiently manage foreign exchange risk arising from USD-invoiced exports, since they tend to export to overseas subsidiaries and benefit from operational hedging that offsets USD-denominated import payments with export revenues within group companies. Smaller firms would continue to choose yen-invoice exports unless they can benefit from operational hedging.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects of cigarette excise taxes on smokers’ household budgets. In a randomized survey experiment, smokers respond to tax increases by adjusting cigarette shopping behaviors, substituting towards other tobacco products, and reducing both discretionary and human capital-related expenditures. Using Consumer Expenditure Survey data and a quasi-experimental design, we find cigarette taxes reduce smoking prevalence but increase cigarette expenditures among continuing smokers. Additionally, a $1 increase in cigarette taxes causes a 2.12% decline in human capital-related expenditures among below median income smokers. Our work uncovers important unintended consequences of cigarette taxes, particularly for low-income individuals.</content>

    <title>Evaluating Recent Crackdowns on Disability Benefits: Effects on Income and Health Care Use in Australia</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many developed countries have enacted reforms to reduce enrollment in disability benefits (DI). We evaluate the effects of a DI crackdown in Australia on the most comprehensive set of outcomes available to date, including earnings, government benefits, family income, and health care utilization. Using a 2014 reform to Australia’s Disability Support Pension, we find that, on average, DI removal has a net zero effect on household income but leads to an increase in prescriptions for strong mental health drugs. However, average effects mask heterogeneity by family structure. For removed recipients living with family, family members increase their earnings by enough to offset the lost DI income, with minimal increase in mental health prescriptions. In contrast, removed recipients living alone do not increase their own earnings or have family support, but their use of strong mental health drugs increases dramatically. We develop a welfare analysis that considers multiple margins of behavioral adjustment. We find that behavioral adjustments offset more than half of the private welfare loss for recipients living with family but very little for those living alone. Government savings exceed household willingness to pay for DI for those living with family, but not for those living alone.</content>

    <title>Why Do Union Jobs Pay More? New Evidence from Matched Employer-Employee Data</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use Canadian matched employer-employee data to assess the sources of the union pay premium. After controlling for worker heterogeneity using the Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999) (AKM) two-way fixed effects approach, we find that unionized firms pay about 15 log points more than non-unionized firms. Forty percent of this gap is linked to productivity differences between unionized and non-unionized firms as measured by value added per worker. The remaining gap reflects unions’ ability to extract more rents for workers. Our estimates imply that unions raise pay among unionized workers by around 9 log points. The union effect grows to about 11 log points in an extension of the AKM approach where unions also affect the returns to unobservable worker characteristics.</content>

    <title>Tariffs and Retaliation: A Brief Macroeconomic Analysis</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We quantify the macroeconomic effects of the tariff measures announced (but not entirely implemented yet) on Liberation Day (April 2nd, 2025) through the lens of a New-Keynesian two-country model calibrated to the US and the rest of the world. We study both a unilateral 10pp tariff increase and a global trade war scenario with retalia- tory tariffs of a similar magnitude. In either case, tariffs are always sharply contractionary for US GDP, increasing inflation and widening the trade deficit. Measured in welfare terms a unilateral tariff generates gains for the US due to a large terms of trade appreciation, but these US welfare gains vanish with global retaliation. Three features of the model are critical in the evaluation of the tariff impact - the asymmetry in size and openness between the US and the rest of the world, the endogenous response of monetary policy to the inflationary effects of tariffs, and the importance of trade in intermediate goods for the scale of the global response to a tariff shock.</content>

    <title>Money or Time? Heterogeneous Effects of Unconditional Cash on Parental Investments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Household time and money allocations in response to income support programs vary across diverse family circumstances and preferences, yet such heterogeneous responses are not well understood. Using data from a large-scale, multisite, U.S.-based randomized controlled study, we examine heterogeneity in the effects of a monthly unconditional cash transfer on monetary and time investments in children. This study offers a novel opportunity to examine heterogeneous effects of a cash transfer by race and ethnicity, where receipt is independent of eligibility based on other demographic characteristics. The effects of the cash transfer on net household income, earnings, and household expenditures were similar for families irrespective of race or ethnicity, even given initial differences in family structure, government benefit receipt, and employment. However, effects on monetary and time investments in children differed. Latino families’ child-focused expenditures increased, equivalent to nearly one-third of the cash transfer, with no effect on maternal employment or time spent with children. Among Black families, maternal work hours decreased and time spent with children on early learning activities increased, with no effect on child-focused expenditures. Marginal propensities to consume child-specific goods from different income sources also varied: Estimates showed a higher marginal propensity to consume child-specific goods from government income than from maternal income among Latino families, and the opposite among Black families. Latino families’ responses to the unconditional cash transfer and to government income are consistent with the notion that signals regarding intended use of income influence spending decisions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how preventive medical care use affects health behaviors and outcomes for patients with chronic diseases. Leveraging variation induced by a national appointment reminder program, rolled out across 315 public primary care clinics in Chile, we use an instrumental variables approach with patient-level administrative data from over 300,000 patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. We find that increased preventive visits lead to more screening tests and large increases in medication adherence. Preventive care also leads to earlier detection and treatment of cardiovascular complications: we document an increase in cardiovascular hospitalizations but a reduction in in-hospital mortality.</content>

    <title>The Gender Gap in Career Trajectories: Do Firms Matter?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The gender wage gap rises with experience. To what extent do firm policies mediate this rise? We use administrative data from Italy to identify workers' first jobs and compute wage growth over the next 5 years. We then decompose the contribution of first employers to the rise in the gender wage gap, taking account of maternity events affecting a third of female entrants. We find that idiosyncratic firm effects explain 20% of the variation in early career wage growth, and that the sorting of women to slower-growth firms accounts for a fifth of the gender growth gap. Women who have a child within 5 years of entering work have particularly slow wage growth, reflecting a maternity effect that is magnified by the excess sorting of mothers-to-be to slower-growth firms. Many entrants change jobs within their first 5 years, and we find that the male-female difference in early career wage growth arises from gaps for both movers and stayers. The first employer components in wage growth for stayers and movers are highly correlated, and contribute similar sorting penalties for women who stay or leave.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines publications in three leading general economics journals from the 1960s through the 2020s, considering levels and trends in the demographics of authors, methodologies of the studies, and patterns of co-authorship. The average age of authors has increased nearly steadily; there has been a sharp increase in the fraction of female authors; the number of authors per paper has risen steadily; and there has been a pronounced shift to articles using newly generated data. All but the first of these trends have been most pronounced in the most recent decade. The study also examines the relationships among these trends.</content>

    <title>Saved by Medicaid: New Evidence on Health Insurance and Mortality from the Universe of Low-Income Adults</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the causal effect of health insurance on mortality using the universe of low-income adults, a dataset of 37 million individuals identified by linking the 2010 Census to administrative tax data. Our methodology leverages state-level variation in the timing and adoption of Medicaid expansions under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and earlier waivers and adheres to a preregistered analysis plan, a rarely used approach in observational studies in economics. We find that expansions increased Medicaid enrollment by 12 percentage points and reduced the mortality of the low-income adult population by 2.5 percent, suggesting a 21 percent reduction in the mortality hazard of new enrollees. Mortality reductions accrued not only to older age cohorts, but also to younger adults, who accounted for nearly half of life-years saved due to their longer remaining lifespans and large share of the low-income adult population. These expansions appear to be cost-effective, with direct budgetary costs of $5.4 million per life saved and $179,000 per life-year saved falling well below valuations commonly found in the literature. Our findings suggest that lack of health insurance explains about five to twenty percent of the mortality disparity between high- and low-income Americans. We contribute to a growing body of evidence that health insurance improves health and demonstrate that Medicaid’s life-saving effects extend across a broader swath of the low-income population than previously understood.</content>

    <title>When Do FOMC Voting Rights Affect Monetary Policy?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using 472 FOMC meetings (1969–2019) and the exogenous rotation of voting rights among Reserve Bank presidents, we identify meetings where local economic conditions in voting districts significantly affect the Federal funds target rate (FFR), while those in non-voting districts show no effect. This voting-group effect persists after controlling for national conditions and Greenbook forecasts, implying that actual FFR decisions plausibly deviated from what average information and expectations would have suggested. Distortions are sizable, persistent, and priced into futures and Treasury markets prior to FOMC meetings. We demonstrate these findings using both components of the Fed’s dual mandate: inflation and unemployment rates.</content>

    <title>Mobile Crisis Response Teams Support Better Policing: Evidence from CAHOOTS</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the use of mobile crisis response teams—a non-uniformed pair consisting of a mental health worker and a medic—as a component of emergency response to 911 calls. We provide the first evaluation of the longest-running program in the United States, Crisis Assistance Helping Out on the Streets (CAHOOTS) in Eugene, Oregon, which responds to calls involving mental illness, homelessness, and addiction either instead of or in addition to police officers. We use two complementary research designs to understand the effects and possible scope of these programs. First, we find that a series of program expansions into new areas and times reduced the likelihood that a 911 call resulted in an arrest and increased access to medical services. The arrest reduction likely reflects CAHOOTS’ role in de-escalating tense situations and resolving incidents without coercive measures. CAHOOTS is most often dispatched to the same calls as the police, acting as a supplement rather than a substitute. Second, we exploit idiosyncratic variation in CAHOOTS availability in the post-expansion periods to estimate the effect of additional marginal program expansions. We find that they are used mostly for calls that would otherwise go unanswered, suggesting that the program has reached a scale where it can respond to the most urgent calls. We conclude that crisis response teams play an important role as a complement to the police rather than acting only as substitutes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greater reliance on nonbank financing makes firms fragile as it leads banks to limit their access to credit lines. Besides demonstrating this result in panel tests subject to range of controls and robustness checks, we employ the 2014–16 oil-price collapse as an exogenous rollover risk in nonbank financing of non-oil-sector firms by collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) exposed to oil sector firms. Nonbank-reliant firms with looming maturities faced reductions and wider spreads in bank credit lines after the shock, resulting in weaker financial and real performance in spite of their drawdowns of existing credit lines.</content>

    <title>Optimal Tariffs When Labor Income Taxes Are Distortionary</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A classic result in trade theory is that it is socially optimal to set the tariff on a good equal to the inverse of the elasticity of its foreign supply. However, this result is based on the assumption that the government can use lump-sum taxes. The paper considers a simple open representative agent economy and characterizes second-best tariffs when the government's only non-tariff source of revenue is linear labor income taxation. If public spending needs are sufficiently large, and import demand is more (less) income-elastic than non-import demand, then the second-best tariff is lower (higher) than the standard optimal tariff.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Child maltreatment is a major public health concern in the United States. Maltreatment is associated with a range of poor health, developmental, and economic outcomes for child victims. In this study, we examine the impact of recent state paid sick leave mandates on child maltreatment reports over the period 2011-2022. Paid sick leave mandates confer financially protected time that can be used for health and family responsibilities as well as for actions such as court hearings that can reduce exposure to domestic violence. These benefits may also reduce maltreatment reports. Using difference-in-differences and event-study methods, we find that child maltreatment reports decline by 11% following the adoption of a state paid sick leave mandate. An analysis of mechanisms suggests that increases in parental and child health, family economic standing, childcare provision, and healthcare are important channels linking paid sick leave mandates to child maltreatment reports.</content>

    <title>Global Shocks, Institutional Development, and Trade Restrictions: What Can We Learn from Crises and Recoveries Between 1990 and 2022?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic were two major shocks to the world economy in the 21st century. In this study, we analyze the patterns of recessions and recoveries of 101 advanced and developing economies. We identify the turning points of recessions and expansions between 1990 and 2022, and perform cross-country analysis of domestic and external drivers of economic recovery. In addition to the standard independent variables, we include institutional development, political stability, the extent of democracy, and trade restrictions indexes, and explore their roles in explaining recessions and recovery patterns. For the whole sample, we find that deeper recessions are followed by stronger recoveries, in line with Friedman’s plucking model of the business cycle. However, the empirical evidence for the plucking model becomes weaker if institutional development is limited and trade restrictions are high. We show that recessions that create conflict and trade tensions differ sharply from those that do not, a highly relevant finding in the current global climate of heightened trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainty. Finally, since developing countries tend to have weaker institutions and higher trade barriers, our evidence suggests that if policy-makers seek to cushion global shocks, they will need to rely on countercyclical monetary and fiscal policy. Implementation of such policies is generally facilitated by robust and credible monetary and fiscal policy frameworks.</content>

    <title>The Sources of Researcher Variation in Economics</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use a rigorous three-stage many-analysts design to assess how different researcher decisions—specifically data cleaning, research design, and the interpretation of a policy question—affect the variation in estimated treatment effects. A total of 146 research teams each completed the same causal inference task three times each: first with few constraints, then using a shared research design, and finally with pre-cleaned data in addition to a specified design. We find that even when analyzing the same data, teams reach different conclusions. In the first stage, the interquartile range (IQR) of the reported policy effect was 3.1 percentage points, with substantial outliers. Surprisingly, the second stage, which restricted research design choices, exhibited slightly higher IQR (4.0 percentage points), largely attributable to imperfect adherence to the prescribed protocol. By contrast, the final stage, featuring standardized data cleaning, narrowed variation in estimated effects, achieving an IQR of 2.4 percentage points. Reported sample sizes also displayed significant convergence under more restrictive conditions, with the IQR dropping from 295,187 in the first stage to 29,144 in the second, and effectively zero by the third. Our findings underscore the critical importance of data cleaning in shaping applied microeconomic results and highlight avenues for future replication efforts.</content>

    <title>Should I Stay or Should I Go? The Response of Labor Migration to Economic Shocks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the responsiveness of labor participation, unemployment and labor migration to exogenous variations in labor demand. Our empirical approach considers four instruments for regional labor demand commonly used in the literature. Empirically, we find that labor migration is a significant margin of adjustment for all our instruments. Following an increase in regional labor demand, the initial increase in employment is accounted for mainly through a reduction in unemployment. Over time however, net labor in-migration becomes the dominant factor contributing to increased regional employment. After 5 years, roughly 60 percent of the increase in employment is explained by the change in population. Responses of labor migration are strongest for individuals aged 20-35. Based on historical data back to the 1950s, we find no evidence of a decline in the elasticity of migration to changes in employment.</content>

    <title>From Delay to PayDay: Easing Bureaucrat Access to Implementation Information Strengthens Social Protection Delivery</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Poor implementation frequently impedes social protection delivery in low-state-capacity settings. In such environments, reducing managers' information acquisition costs may improve their grasp of frontline issues and program performance. However, in the presence of managerial rent-seeking, increasing the principal's information may be key, and doing so just for managers can backfire. To assess this trade-off and implications for program performance, we collaborated with two Indian states to randomly vary bureaucrat access to “PayDash”, a digital platform for real-time tracking of worker payment processing for the national rural workfare program. In treated districts, PayDash expedited bureaucrat processing of workfare payments by 17%, and increased available worksites and participating household work days by 23% and 10%, respectively. Work provision rose relatively more during the agricultural lean season. PayDash has the same impact when offered to principals as to managers, and no further gains when offered to both, indicating that manager effort to acquire information constrains implementation. Consistent with information allowing principals to better condition performance incentives on managerial effort, PayDash for principals reduced manager posting transfers by 24%. PayDash strengthened state capacity at a considerably lower cost than hiring staff, while benefiting rural Indians by more than 170 times the costs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Finding new international suppliers is costly, so most importers source inputs from a single country. We examine the role of banks in mitigating trade search costs during the 2018–2019 U.S.-China trade tensions. We match data on shipments to U.S. ports with the U.S. credit register to analyze trade and bank credit relationships at the bank-firm level. We show that importers of tariff-hit products from China were more likely to exit relationships with Chinese suppliers and to find new suppliers in other Asian countries. To finance their geographic diversification, tariff-hit firms increased credit demand, drawing on bank credit lines and taking out loans at higher rates. Banks offering specialized trade finance services to Asian markets eased both financial and information frictions. Tariff-hit firms with specialized banks borrowed at lower rates and were 15 pps more likely and 3 months faster to establish new supplier relationships than firms with other banks. We estimate the cost of searching for suppliers at $1.9 million (or 5% of annual sales revenue) for the average U.S. importer.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents a framework to standardize crowd-sourced computational reproductions in economics through the Social Science Reproduction Platform (SSRP). The approach address four main challenges for computational reproductions: a lack of standardization, aggregation issues, existing incentives for “adversarial” interactions, and the loss of knowledge from analyses that are never published. We then summarize the first 487 reproductions uploaded on the SSRP. The results show substantial heterogeneity in the ability to successfully reproduce empirical results in economics research, with approximately 30% of recent studies meeting at least a basic definition of being computationally reproducible.</content>

    <title>Climate Boards: Do Natural Disaster Experiences Make Directors More Prosocial?</title>

    <author>
      <name>Sehoon Kim, Bernadette A. Minton &amp; Rohan G. Williamson</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that corporate directors’ past experience with abnormally severe climatic natural disasters shape their prosocial preferences and influence firm climate policies. Using detailed data on director career histories and county-level natural disasters, we identify Directors with Abnormal Disaster Experiences (DADEs). DADEs are significantly more likely to be affiliated with nonprofit organizations, consistent with heightened prosocial preferences. Importantly, firms with more DADEs on their boards exhibit lower scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emission intensities and are more likely to implement climate-related policies, including board climate oversight, emission targets, and management incentives to reduce emissions. These effects are driven by influential DADEs serving on governance, audit, or ESG committees, but absent among DADEs on finance, compensation, or risk committees, supporting a preference-based rather than risk-based mechanism. Independent directors, rather than the influence of CEOs, play a central role. The effects are stronger when disaster experiences are accumulated over longer histories and in large or high-emission firms. The results are muted in smaller disasters and not driven by recent trends in attention to climate change. Despite the role of preferences, firms with more DADEs do not exhibit worse financial or operational performance. Using director deaths as plausibly exogenous shocks, we provide causal evidence. Our findings show that directors’ experiences heighten their prosocial preferences that lead them to influence corporate climate policy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present evidence on how generative AI changes the work patterns of knowledge workers using data from a 6-month-long, cross-industry, randomized field experiment. Half of the 7,137 workers in the study received access to a generative AI tool integrated into the applications they already used for emails, document creation, and meetings. We find that access to the AI tool during the first year of its release primarily impacted behaviors that workers could change independently and not behaviors that require coordination to change: workers who used the tool in more than half of the sample weeks spent 3.6 fewer hours, or 31% less time on email each week (intent to treat estimate is 1.3 hours) and completed documents moderately faster, but did not significantly change time spent in meetings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In macroeconomic models with dispersed information, agents have an incentive to learn from endogenous variables, which themselves depend on the forecasts of others. This paper revisits the model of Townsend (1983) to characterize how this mechanism affects equilibrium dynamics. The first part of the paper simplifies, revises, and extends past results about situations when prices are fully revealing. The second part shows that full revelation does not occur in the original model and proves that the equilibrium state vector is infinite-dimensional. It also provides a new numerical solution procedure for such cases, which operates entirely in the frequency domain.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study optimal policy when heterogeneous markups reflect compensation for uninsurable persistent idiosyncratic risk. The optimal labor tax keep rate equals (1) the aggregate markup times (2) workers' consumption share divided by their Pareto weight. Markups correctly capture the private cost of risk that reduces labor demand, but they are socially inefficient. This requires a subsidy equal to the aggregate markup, as in the traditional market-power perspective. However, even with lump-sum transfers, risk markups lead entrepreneurs to dynamically overaccumulate wealth to self-insure, so impoverished workers oversupply labor. In the long run this effect dominates and it's optimal to tax labor.</content>

    <title>Location Effects or Sorting? Evidence from Firm Relocation</title>
    <updated>2025-05-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why are wages in cities like New York or Paris higher than in others? This paper uses firm mobility to separate the role of “location effects” (e.g., local geography, infrastructure, and agglomeration) from the spatial sorting of workers and firms. Using French administrative records and U.S. commercial data, we first document that firm mobility is widespread: 4% of establishments relocate annually. Establishments retain their main activity and structure as they move, but adjust their workforce and wages. Combining firm and worker mobility, we then decompose wage disparities across French commuting zones. We find that spatial wage differences are largely driven by the sorting and co-location of workers and firms: location effects account for only 2–5% of disparities, while differences in the composition of workers and establishments account for around 30% and 15%, respectively. The remaining half is accounted for by the co-location of high-wage workers and firms, especially in cities with high location effects. Revisiting the elasticity of local wages to population density, we find a significant coefficient of 0.007 - two to three times lower than estimates not controlling for firm composition.</content>

    <title>Is ESG a Sideshow? ESG Perceptions, Investment, and Firms' Financing Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects of market ESG perceptions, as proxied by ESG ratings, on public firms’ security issuance and asset accumulation decisions. Higher ESG scores are followed by capital structure adjustments, specifically increases in equity issuance and decreases in net debt issuance of similar magnitude. These are driven completely by the “E” component of ESG. There are no effects of ESG assessments on capital expenditures or non-cash asset accumulation, supporting the hypothesis that ESG perceptions are a sideshow for capital investment. To address the endogeneity of firms' decisions to raise equity, we consider industry-wide rating changes and decompose the ESG ratings into an industry- and a firm-specific component. The response to the industry component of equity and debt issuance is highly significant, indicating that our findings are not explained by firms' decisions. As many ratings products use restated or backfilled ratings, our results focus on a point-in-time (PIT) ratings panel that we develop. We document that if using a standard ratings product instead of PIT data, researchers might falsely infer that higher ESG ratings lead to asset accumulation, due in particular to the use of restated ESG scores in standard ratings data products.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Unfunded fiscal shocks are a significant source of risk premia in Treasury markets when central banks and governments decide to insulate taxpayers and expose bondholders' wealth to government funding needs. We illustrate this bond risk premium mechanism analytically in a two-agent model featuring monetary-fiscal interactions and a fraction of constrained agents. Surprise government transfer spending devalues real Treasury payoffs through fiscal inflation, while fiscal redistribution makes these high marginal utility states for bond investors, leading to risky government debt. We show that this fiscal redistribution mechanism can quantitatively explain the nominal term premium in a TANK framework.</content>

    <title>Assessing the Estimands and Estimates of Hospitalization Rates in Health Economics and Clinical Medicine</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Even though data on hospital admissions are widely used in health research, hospitalization-related quantities measured using these data are not always clearly conceptualized. Consequently, estimators of these quantities can have unclear rationales and undesirable properties. We evaluate three rate estimators for measuring hospitalization-related quantities that are of interest in health economics and clinical medicine subspecialities. Using the Grossman human capital model, we motivate the importance of measuring healthy time. We show that an upper bound on healthy time can be calculated using lengths of hospital stay without assumptions about health status outside the hospital. We find that an admission rate conventionally used in clinical research is a patient follow-up time weighted average that lacks a clear basis for the weights. We evaluate the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) use of risk-standardized readmission rates to penalize hospitals under the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) and find that it may inadvertently conflict with disease-specific care aimed at reducing mortality risk. We show that risk-standardized rates can be sensitive to patient case mix, potentially leading to hospital rankings that do not reflect hospital quality. We also summarize debates regarding the effectiveness of risk-standardized readmission rates in reducing readmissions.</content>

    <title>Culture and Contemporary Political Preferences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter reviews the literature on the relationship between culture and  political preferences. We  distinguish conceptually between the direct cultural transmission of political ideology and the transmission of more primitive preferences and beliefs that influence preferences over policies, parties, and forms of government. While there is substantial evidence that political preferences persist across generations and within communities, the literature often does not specify which primitive values and beliefs drive this persistence. A growing body of work points to a multifaceted mapping from underlying preferences and beliefs over the material world and social relations to political ideology. In this chapter, we summarize these studies, organize their findings in a coherent framework, and suggest possible directions for future research.</content>

    <title>The Tariff Tax Cut: Tariffs as Revenue</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate the aggregate effects of a change in tariffs on the US and world economies when tariff revenue is used to enact fiscal reform. Our model combines a standard international model of fiscal policy with taxes and a dynamic model of trade participation and tariffs that allows for uncertainty and transitions. We consider effects of permanent and temporary tariffs–with and without retaliation–when tariff revenue is used to reduce taxes on capital or labor or to subsidize investment. Compared to a lump sum redistribution, using tariff revenue for these reforms always boosts economic activity. Key to our analysis is the effect of trade dynamics on import substitution, such that tariff revenue after an increase in tariffs is higher in the short run than in the long run. When increasing the tariff by 20 percentage points, the revenue raised is largest when tariffs are temporary, unilateral, and used to subsidize investment, increasing by about 2 percent of GDP. This case also yields a large temporary increase in the trade balance. We find the welfare-maximizing unilateral tariff is close to 18 percent when tariff revenue is used to subsidize investment compared to 0 percent under a lump sum redistribution. We also find cutting capital taxes does not generate as much growth as introducing an investment subsidy since tariffs raise the price of investment substantially.</content>

    <title>Large Language Models, Small Labor Market Effects</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the labor market effects of AI chatbots using two large-scale adoption surveys (late 2023 and 2024) covering 11 exposed occupations (25,000 workers, 7,000 workplaces), linked to matched employer-employee data in Denmark. AI chatbots are now widespread—most employers encourage their use, many deploy in-house models, and training initiatives are common. These firm-led investments boost adoption, narrow demographic gaps in take-up, enhance workplace utility, and create new job tasks. Yet, despite substantial investments, economic impacts remain minimal. Using difference-in-differences and employer policies as quasi-experimental variation, we estimate precise zeros: AI chatbots have had no significant impact on earnings or recorded hours in any occupation, with confidence intervals ruling out effects larger than 1%. Modest productivity gains (average time savings of 3%), combined with weak wage pass-through, help explain these limited labor market effects. Our findings challenge narratives of imminent labor market transformation due to Generative AI.</content>

    <title>Divorce, Family Arrangements, and Children's Adult Outcomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nearly a third of American children experience parental divorce before adulthood. To understand its consequences, we use linked tax and Census records for over 5 million children to examine how divorce affects family arrangements and children's long-term outcomes. Following divorce, parents move apart, household income falls, parents work longer hours, families move more frequently, and households relocate to poorer neighborhoods with less economic opportunity. This bundle of changes in family circumstances suggests multiple channels through which divorce may affect children's development and outcomes. In the years following divorce, we observe sharp increases in teen births and child mortality. To examine long-run effects on children, we compare siblings with different lengths of exposure to the same divorce. We find that parental divorce reduces children's adult earnings and college residence while increasing incarceration, mortality, and teen births. Changes in household income, neighborhood quality, and parent proximity account for 25 to 60 percent of these divorce effects.</content>

    <title>Acquiring Patents in Secret: Disclosure Timing in Markets for Technology</title>
    <updated>2025-05-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Markets for technology provide a vibrant channel through which firms purchase ownership rights to patented inventions. Although such transactions enable firms to secure access to intangible assets originating beyond their borders, they also provide cues to competitors regarding the purchasing firm’s technological investments. This study explores the timing of strategic disclosure of patent acquisitions and the conditions under which firms trade the benefits of competitor deterrence through early recordation for those of secrecy through delayed disclosure. Using evidence on the lag between the execution and recording dates for US patents purchased by publicly traded corporations, we predict and find earlier disclosure of patent acquisitions when the buyer works on related technologies and is better positioned to enforce the patents (i.e., is large and relatively litigious). As predicted by the model, we also find that the buyer delays disclosure when the seller is a large firm, suggesting that buyers take advantage of the seller’s ability to deter competitors while keeping the transaction secret. Additional analyses reveal that (a) regulatory changes reducing the value of keeping acquisitions of patent applications secret lead to shorter recording lags, and (b) increases in the enforceability of business method and software patents further accelerate the voluntary recording of patent ownership changes. The study provides new evidence on the tradeoffs that innovating firms face when determining the timing of disclosure for patents they have purchased in technology markets.</content>

    <title>The Social Returns to Public R&amp;D</title>
    <updated>2025-05-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Andrew J. Fieldhouse &amp; Karel Mertens</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent empirical evidence by Fieldhouse and Mertens (2024) points to a strong causal link between federal nondefense R&amp;D funding and private-sector productivity growth, and large implied social returns to public R&amp;D investment. We show that these high social return estimates broadly align with existing evidence on the social returns to private or total R&amp;D spending. If the R&amp;D increases authorized under the CHIPS and Science Act were fully appropriated, our modeling indicates a boost in U.S. productivity within a few years, reaching gains of 0.2–0.4% after seven years or more. At their peak, the direct productivity effects of the implied expansion in nondefense R&amp;D alone would raise output by over $40 billion in a single year—exceeding total outlays from the CHIPS Act R&amp;D provisions over a decade. The potential productivity impact of fiscal consolidations changing R&amp;D spending is not clear ex ante. We show that in recent fiscal consolidations, cuts to federal R&amp;D funding were largely borne by defense R&amp;D, whereas funding for nondefense R&amp;D was largely spared or was increased. Our evidence suggests that future deficit reduction efforts that instead emphasize cuts to nondefense R&amp;D funding could have a larger adverse impact on productivity and economic growth than previous fiscal consolidations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Healthcare firms are filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy at record rates. We find that bankruptcies increase healthcare staff turnover, worsen care, and harm patients. Using a difference-in- differences design, we estimate that a bankruptcy filing immediately increases staff turnover and worsens the firm’s performance on unannounced inspections. Next, using a patient- distance-to-facility instrument, we document that bankruptcies harm patients through increases in hospitalizations, physical restraints, and bedsores. Finally, we employ a randomized survey experiment of nursing home staff to confirm that bankruptcy filings increase voluntary departures and that replacement workers harm patients.</content>

    <title>Universal Pre-K as Economic Stimulus: Evidence from Nine States and Large Cities in the U.S.</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While Universal Pre-Kindergarten (UPK) is often proposed as an economic stimulus, its market effects remain uncertain. We analyze UPK programs implemented across nine states and cities from 1995 to 2020, leveraging their staggered adoption for identification. UPK increased Pre-K enrollment and led to a 1.2% rise in labor force participation, a 1.5% increase in employment, and a 1.6% growth in hours worked, resulting in higher aggregate earnings. Employment effects were strongest for mothers but extended to other groups, primarily women. Impacts varied, with the largest effects observed in areas with high public Pre-K enrollment. Notably, each dollar spent on UPK generated between 3 to over 20 dollars in aggregate earnings – enough that tax revenues might fully cover costs.</content>

    <title>Transformative and Subsistence Entrepreneurs: Origins and Impacts on Economic Growth</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores the symbiotic relationship between transformative entrepreneurs and inventors, which is crucial for economic growth. We utilize microdata from Denmark to demonstrate that while the relationship between IQ and general entrepreneurship tends to be negative, it is strongly positive among transformative entrepreneurs. Transformative entrepreneurs, often with higher IQ and education levels, significantly drive R&amp;D and business growth, thereby providing substantial opportunities for inventors. In contrast, average entrepreneurs are more influenced by their family’s entrepreneurship background. Our economic model links these dynamics to overall economic progress, highlighting how higher education influences career paths in entrepreneurship and invention. We identify talent misallocation caused by unequal education access, particularly affecting lower-income families. Our findings indicates the most effective policies strengthen the interplay between higher education, innovation, and entrepreneurship to foster transformative businesses and achieve long-run economic growth.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show better-managed firms are more dynamic in plant acquisitions, disposals, openings and closings in U.S. Census and international data. Better-managed firms also birth better-managed plants and improve the performance of the plants they acquire. To explain these findings we build a model with two key elements. First, management is a combination of firm-level management ability (e.g. CEO quality), which can be transferred to all plants, and plant-level management practices, which can be changed through intangible investment (e.g. consulting or training). Second, management both raises productivity and also reduces the operational costs of dynamism: buying, selling, opening and closing plants. We structurally estimate the model on Census microdata, fitting our key dynamic moments, and then use it to establish three additional results. First, mergers and acquisitions raise economy-wide management and productivity by reallocating plants to firms with higher management ability. Banning M&amp;A would depress GDP and management by about 15%. Second, greater product market competition improves both management and productivity by reallocating away from badly managed plants. Finally, management practices account for about 20% of the cross-country productivity differences with the US.</content>

    <title>The Impacts of Grade Retention Policy With Minimal Retention</title>
    <updated>2025-05-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;State laws that mandate in-grade retention for struggling readers are widespread in the U.S., covering 34% of public-school third graders in 2023-24. This study investigates the impacts of Michigan’s third-grade reading law on subsequent test scores and school progress outcomes for the 2020-21 and 2021-22 third-grade cohorts. Using a regression discontinuity (RD) design, we find that being flagged for retention raises students’ reading scores in the next school year by 0.045 standard deviations (SD)—a modest but meaningful impact. Because being flagged increases the likelihood of actually being retained by only 3.4 percentage points, the implied effect of retention itself under standard “fuzzy” RD assumptions would be an implausibly large 1.3 SD. This result suggests flagging may affect outcomes via mechanisms other than just retention, a violation of the exclusion restriction. Indeed, we estimate similar effects even in districts that retain no students. Survey evidence suggests flagged students receive more intensive reading support even if they are not retained. Our findings suggest retention may be a much less important component of literacy reforms than previously understood. Finally, given the similarity between Michigan’s reading law and those in other states, our findings raise concerns about potential bias in previously estimated retention effects.</content>

    <title>Who Benefits from Place-Based Policies? Evidence from Matched Employer-Employee Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the granular wage and employment effects of a German place-based policy using a research design that leverages EU-wide rules governing program parameters at the regional level. The program subsidizes investments to create jobs with a subsidy rate that varies across labor market regions. We use matched data on the universe of establishments and their employees, establishment-level panel data on program participation, and regional scores that generate spatial discontinuities in program eligibility and generosity. Spatial spillovers of the program linked to changing commuting patterns can be assessed using information on place of work and place of residence, a unique feature of the data. We find that the program helps establishments create jobs that disproportionately benefit younger and less-educated workers. Funded establishments increase their wages, but, unlike employment, wage gains do not persist in the long run. Employment effects estimated at the local level are slightly larger than establishment-level estimates, suggesting limited economic spillover effect. Spatial spillovers are large as over half of the employment increase comes from commuters. Using subsidy rates as an instrumental variable for actual subsidies indicates that it costs approximately EUR 25,000 to create a new job in the economically disadvantaged areas targeted by the program.</content>

    <title>Who You Gonna Call? Gender Inequality in External Demands for Parental Involvement</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Gender imbalance in time spent on child rearing causes gender inequalities in labor market outcomes, human capital accumulation, and economic mobility. We conduct a large-scale field experiment with a near-universe of US schools to investigate a potential source of inequality: external demands for parental involvement. Schools receive an email from a fictitious two-parent household and are asked to call one of the parents back. Mothers are 1.4 times more likely than fathers to be contacted. We decompose this inequality and demonstrate that the gender gap in external demands is associated with various measures of gender norms. We also show that signaling a father’s availability substantially changes the gender pattern of callbacks. Our findings underscore a process through which agents outside the household contribute to within-household gender inequalities.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a novel firm-level remote work measure created from big data on Internet activity, we show that firms with higher remote work during the pandemic are more likely to see their employees becoming entrepreneurs. This effect holds both unconditionally and relative to other types of job turnovers. We establish causality using instrumental variables and a panel event study. The marginally created businesses are higher quality than the average new firm. The effect is not driven by employee selection, preference change, or forced turnover. Rather, remote work increases spawning by providing the time and downside protection needed for entrepreneurial experimentation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study U.S. bank branch openings and closings from 2001 to 2023. Both are more common in areas with low deposit franchise value, a consequence of greater interest-rate sensitivity among financially sophisticated households with higher digital banking adoption. The effects are strongest for large banks. Lending plays a minimal role. Incumbents retain branches where depositors are less sensitive to rates because they can extract deposit spreads; entrants avoid such markets because sticky customers are difficult to attract. The pandemic accelerated closures by increasing digital reliance. Our findings highlight deposit franchise value as the primary driver of modern branch restructuring.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the optimal monetary policy response to the imposition of tariffs in a model with imported intermediate inputs. In a simple open-economy framework, we show that a tariff maps exactly into a cost-push shock in the standard closed-economy New Keynesian model, shifting the Phillips curve upward. We then characterize optimal monetary policy, showing that it partially accommodates the shock to smooth the transition to a more distorted long-run equilibrium—at the cost of higher short-run inflation.</content>

    <title>Making America Great Again? The Economic Impacts of Liberation Day Tariffs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;On April 2, 2025, President Trump declared “Liberation Day,” announcing broad tariffs to reduce trade deficits and revive U.S. industry. We analyze the long-term economic impacts of these tariffs through the lens of a trade model that features flexible tariff passthrough and endogenous trade deficits, calibrated to trade and income data from 194 countries. If trading partners do not retaliate, the tariffs could decrease the U.S. trade deficit and improve its terms of trade, yielding modest welfare gains when tariff revenues reduce the income tax burden for American workers. However, reciprocal retaliation results in net welfare losses for the U.S. economy. We derive the unilaterally optimal tariff within our model and show that the USTR tariffs, based on bilateral deficits, differ markedly from this theoretical benchmark. Our calibrated model implies a unilaterally optimal tariff for the U.S. of 19 percent, uniformly applied across all trading partners, and linked to the overall trade deficit rather than bilateral imbalances. Under optimal foreign retaliation to the USTR tariffs, the calibrated model predicts a decline in U.S. welfare by up to 3.8 percent when accounting for input-output linkages, and a contraction in global employment by 1.1 percent.</content>

    <title>Job Amenity Shocks and Labor Reallocation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce aggregate shocks to workers' value of job amenities in a frictional equilibrium model of the labor market with on-the-job search, where the job creation cost is sunk and quits trigger vacancies. We examine how key labor market indicators respond to this shock: when the valuation of the amenity is heterogeneous in the population, labor reallocation ensues. A calibrated version of the model can quantitatively account for many distinct traits of the post-pandemic labor market recovery through three aggregate shocks: a temporary fall in productivity to account for the short, but sharp, downturn; a decline in the willingness to work; and, crucially, a persistent increase in workers' evaluation of job amenities. Cross-sectoral patterns of vacancies, quit rates, job-filling rates, and wages—where sectors are ranked by their share of teleworkable jobs—provide support to the view that the key amenity in question is the ability to work remotely.</content>

    <title>The 2025 Trade War: Dynamic Impacts Across U.S. States and the Global Economy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use a dynamic trade and reallocation model with downward nominal wage rigidities to quantitatively assess the economic consequences of recent U.S. tariff increases on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China, as well as the “reciprocal” tariff changes announced on “Liberation Day” and retaliatory measures by other countries. Higher tariffs lead to a rise in U.S. manufacturing employment, but this comes at the cost of declines in service and agricultural jobs. Overall employment falls, as lower real wages reduce labor-force participation. Real income in the U.S. declines by about 1% by 2028, the final year we assume the tariffs remain in effect. A key feature of our analysis is the disaggregation of the U.S. into its 50 states, incorporating cross-state redistribution of tariff revenue. This allows us to identify which states gain or lose more from the policy shock. Around half of the states experience real income losses, with some seeing declines greater than 3%. At the international level, close U.S. trading partners—including Canada, Mexico, China, and Ireland—suffer the largest real income losses.</content>

    <title>Separation of Church and State Curricula? Examining Public and Religious Private School Textbooks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Curricula impart knowledge, instill values, and shape collective memory. Despite growing public funding for religious schools through U.S. school choice programs, little is known about what they teach. We examine textbooks from public schools, religious private schools, and home schools, applying computational methods—including AI tools—to measure the presence and portrayal of people, topics, and values over time. Despite narratives of political polarization, our findings reveal few meaningful differences between public school textbooks from Texas and California. However, religious school textbooks have less female representation, feature lighter-skinned individuals, and portray topics like evolution and religion differently. Over one-third of pages in each collection convey character values, with a higher proportion in religious school textbooks. Important similarities also emerge: all textbook collections rarely include LGBTQIA+ discussion, portray females in more positive but less active or powerful contexts than males, and depict the U.S. founding era and slavery in similar contexts.</content>

    <title>Litigation Risk and the Valuation of Legal Claims: A Real Option Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Legal claims are increasingly being considered as an alternative asset class, however, there appears to be a lack of a standard methodology for valuing litigation risk. This paper proposes a dynamic real options framework for the valuation of legal claims, explicitly incorporating the uncertainty and sequential nature of litigation processes. We develop a continuous-time stochastic model that accounts for the main procedural milestones and uncertainties, enabling the simulation of diverse litigation trajectories to estimate the net present value of a claim. The model permits the decision-maker to optimally continue or abandon the litigation at various stages, thereby capturing the embedded option value and enhancing claim valuation. This approach offers a novel risk management and valuation tool for a range of stakeholders, including investors, third-party funders, claimants, defendants, legal practitioners, auditors, and insurers. We demonstrate the practical relevance of the methodology by applying it to an actual international investment arbitration case.</content>

    <title>Migration and Regime Change: Outflows Follow Democratic Decline, Inflows Fuel Illiberal Drift</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores the two-way relationship between international migration and political regime change, emphasizing the potential for a feedback loop: political shifts influence migration patterns, and migration can, in turn, affect political developments. Using a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach and a dataset combining migration flows, regime quality indicators (CHRI), and measures of economic integration such as EU membership, the study identifies three key findings. First, substantial immigration into politically fragile democracies can further weaken their institutions. Second, democratic decline tends to increase emigration, undermining a country's ability to a democratic institutional recovery. Third, international economic integration, particularly in our study, through EU accession—shapes how emigration responds to political change.</content>

    <title>Renewable Asset Price Volatility and Its Implications for Decarbonization</title>
    <updated>2025-05-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We find that the price volatility of renewable assets is significantly greater than that of brown assets. Our causal estimates leverage the response of electricity and credit markets to US state-level renewable portfolio standards that require some utilities to use renewables while exempting others.  This extra risk is related to more volatile electricity prices and revenues, consistent with uncertainties including renewables intermittency. Using a growth model where the share of green capital balances climate damages and diversification benefits, we find that greater green-asset volatility is a more important determinant of economy-wide decarbonization than productivity differences of green versus brown capital.</content>

    <title>In Good Company: Coethnic Advisors and Career Paths of Immigrant Ph.D. Students</title>
    <updated>2025-05-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we examine the role of coethnic advisor-student matching in U.S. Ph.D. programs in attracting, training and guiding immigrant talent into top jobs in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Using comprehensive administrative data on 1,769 AI Ph.D. graduates from top U.S. programs, combined with their advisors’ profiles and post-Ph.D. employment outcomes, and complemented by original survey data, we document two new findings. First, immigrant students systematically match with coethnic thesis advisors at markedly higher rates than would be expected by chance. This matching is shaped by reputational spillovers, pre-Ph.D. contact, and preference for shared backgrounds. Second, immigrant students with coethnic advisors are more likely to enter high-quality industry jobs after graduation than their native counterparts. We find suggestive evidence that this is driven by access to industry internships, facilitated by these advisors' unique professional networks. Our findings reveal that universities, through their immigrant-origin faculty, act as critical conduits connecting global scientific talent to the U.S. innovation economy. An important organizational implication of our results is that disruptions to immigration may constrain firm-level access to talent and weaken the academic-to-industry pipeline.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We evaluate impacts heterogeneity of an Early Childhood Intervention, with respect to the Educational Attainment Polygenic Score (EA4 PGS) constructed from DNA data based on GWAS weights from a European population. We find that the EA4 PGS is predictive of several measures of child development, mother’s IQ and, to some extent, educational attainment. We also show that the impacts of the intervention are significantly greater in children with low PGS, to the point that the intervention eliminates the initial genetic disadvantage. Lastly, we find that children with high PGS attract more parental stimulation; however, the latter increases more strongly in children with low PGS.</content>
