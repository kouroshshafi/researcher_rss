    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As a successful competitive research bid to use  Japanese customs data, this study calculates the share of trade denomination currency (invoice currency) in Japan's exports and imports by industry and country from individual export and import documents. The results clarify the characteristics of invoice currency choice. The invoice currency share data by industry and country, compiled from customs data, shows each industry's characteristics by country. We confirm that the industry sector of the traded goods plays a role in the choice of invoice currency shares. In addition, we found that invoice currency shares in some industries varied significantly over the sample period from 2014 to 2022. This indicates that heightened geopolitical risks and supply chain restructuring in recent years may affect the choice of invoice currency. We have confirmed a large gap between the average (vs. world) share and the share by individual industry and country. Time-series changes are also remarkable. Our data indicates that the invoice currency shares aggregated in trade with the world do not necessarily reflect changes in invoice currency shares or the actual use of partner country currencies.</content>

    <title>Tradeoffs over Rate Cycles: Activity, Inflation and the Price Level</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Central banks often face tradeoffs in how their monetary policy decisions impact economic activity (including employment), inflation and the price level. This paper assesses how these tradeoffs have evolved over time and varied across countries, with a focus on understanding the post-pandemic adjustment. To make these comparisons, we compile a cross-country, historical database of “rate cycles” (i.e., easing and tightening phases for monetary policy) for 24 advanced economies from 1970 through 2024. This allows us to quantify the characteristics of interest rate adjustments and corresponding macroeconomic outcomes and tradeoffs. We also calculate Sacrifice Ratios (output losses per inflation reduction) and document a historically low “sacrifice” during the post-pandemic tightening. This popular measure, however, ignores adjustments in the price level—which increased by more after the pandemic than over the past four decades. A series of regressions and simulations suggest monetary policy (and particularly the timing and aggressiveness of rate hikes) play a meaningful role in explaining these tradeoffs and how adjustments occur during tightening phases. Central bank credibility is the one measure we assess that corresponds to only positive outcomes and no difficult tradeoffs.</content>

    <title>What Works for the Unemployed? Evidence From Quasi-Random Caseworker Assignments</title>
    <updated>2025-05-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Anders Humlum, Jakob Munch &amp; Mette Rasmussen</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines if active labor market programs help unemployed job seekers find jobs using a novel random caseworker instrumental variable (IV) design. Leveraging administrative data from Denmark, our identification strategy exploits that (i) job seekers are quasi-randomly assigned to caseworkers, and (ii) caseworkers differ in their tendencies to assign similar job seekers to different programs. Using our IV strategy, we find assignment to classroom training increases employment by 29% two years after initial job loss of compliers. This finding contrasts with the conclusion reached by ordinary least squares (OLS), which suffers from a negative bias due to selection on unobservables. The employment effects are driven by job seekers who complete the programs (post-program effects) rather than job seekers who exit unemployment upon assignment (threat effects), and the programs help job seekers change occupations. We show that job seekers exposed to offshoring – who tend to experience larger and more persistent employment losses – also have higher employment gains from classroom training. By estimating marginal treatment effects, we conclude that total employment may be increased by targeting training toward job seekers exposed to offshoring.</content>

    <title>Consumer Sentiment Towards Asians in the Early Days of the Covid-19 Pandemic</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We revisit the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic to examine whether restaurant foot traffic reveals changes in sentiment towards ethnic groups. Our findings show reduced demand for dining at Asian restaurants located inside Asian enclaves, while outside enclaves, the decline in visits to Asian restaurants was comparable to non-Asian restaurants. In contrast, Italian restaurant enclaves did not experience similar declines in foot traffic after news of the outbreak in Italy and the first U.S. case linked to travel to Italy. We also find suggestive evidence that the shift in consumption was associated with elevated negative sentiment towards Asians rather than efforts to avoid exposure to international travelers.</content>

    <title>How Damaging is Shouting "Fire" in a Crowded Theatre?</title>
    <updated>2025-05-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The canonical example of unprotected speech—falsely shouting “fire” in a crowded theatre—presumes such an act inevitably causes harmful panic. This paper challenges that presumption through a game-theoretic analysis of evacuation dynamics. I model a theatre as an N × M grid where rational patrons navigate spatial constraints while evacuating. Strategic conflicts arise only when patrons are equidistant from exits, creating localized “clash games” that admit multiple equilibria, including numerous pure-strategy equilibria that achieve zero-collision evacuations. Using global games methodology, I show that strategic uncertainty uniquely selects an equilibrium, where those entering from rows have precedence over those already in aisles. However, introducing a panic mechanism based on accumulated waiting time reveals a tension: the strategically optimal East-priority equilibrium proves most vulnerable to behavioral breakdown, while the alternating equilibrium exhibits superior robustness to panic. These findings suggest that whether false alarms cause harmful disorder depends critically on the interaction between spatial geometry, strategic behavior, and psychological limits—not merely on the alarm itself.</content>

    <title>Spillovers from Public Health Policies in Schools: Evidence from COVID Mask Mandates</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Schools have long played a frontline role in efforts to contain infectious diseases and prevent spread to the wider community. These include vaccination requirements, school closures during periods of high illness, and the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) during outbreaks. In this paper we investigate the impact of mask mandates in schools on COVID spread. We use event study and difference-in-differences models that exploit the removal of mask mandates in districts serving 50% of public school students in the U.S. surrounding the revocation of CDC guidance recommending school masking in February and early March of 2022. We estimate that going from 0% to 100% mandated masking in a county reduces COVID deaths by 0.57 per 100k people. We further estimate that the removal of mandates during this time contributed to 21800 COVID deaths through the rest of 2022, 9% of the U.S. total that year. Due to the fact that COVID deaths among students and, to a lesser extent, school staff were rare in the U.S. given school age profiles, we argue that the bulk of these deaths were from spillovers to residents in the wider community.</content>

    <title>Bidding for Talent: A Test of Conduct in a High-Wage Labor Market</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a procedure for adjudicating between models of firm wage-setting conduct. Using data from a U.S. job search platform, we propose a methodology to aggregate workers’ choices over menus of jobs into rankings of firms’ non-wage amenities. We use these estimates to formulate a test of conduct based on exclusion restrictions. Oligopsonistic models incorporating strategic interactions between firms and tailoring of wage offers to workers’ outside options are rejected in favor of monopsonistic models featuring near-uniform markdowns. Misspecification has meaningful consequences: our preferred model predicts average markdowns of 19.5%, while others predict average markdowns as large as 26.6%.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the shift to fully remote work at a large call center in Turkey, highlighting three findings. First, fully remote work increased the share of women, including married women, rural and smaller-town residents. By accessing groups with traditionally lower labor-force participation the firm was able to increase its share of graduate employees by 14% without raising wages. Second, workforce productivity rose by 10%, reflecting shorter call durations for remote employees. This was facilitated by a quieter home working environment, avoiding the background noise in the office. Third, fully remote employees with initial in-person training saw higher long-run remote productivity and lower attrition rates. This underscores the advantages of initial in-person onboarding for fully remote employees.</content>

    <title>Measuring Self-Reported Well-Being</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What should researchers consider when designing experiments that (also) collect self-reported well-being (SWB) data? Focusing on experiments in economics, we examine the motivation behind SWB-data collection, survey leading past examples, and highlight potential pitfalls and their proposed countermeasures.
We offer three main messages and a call to action. First, SWB measures should be handled with caution, especially in experiments. Second, despite their limitations, SWB measures can be used cleverly in the lab to provide evidence on questions that choice data alone cannot answer. Third, when collected, analyzed, and interpreted with appropriate caution, SWB measures can be important policy-evaluation outcomes, complementing the inherently incomplete picture provided by more traditional outcomes.
We call on researchers to carefully and thoughtfully collect (a variety of) SWB measures in their online, lab, and field experiments. Such a joint, decentralized effort would also mean that over time, SWB data get explored, accumulated, and, hopefully, better understood.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We elicited over a million stated preference choices over 126 dimensions or “aspects” of well-being from a sample of 3,358 respondents on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Our surveys also collected self-reported well-being (SWB) questions about respondents’ current levels of the aspects of well-being. From the stated preference data, we estimate relative log marginal utilities per point on our 0-100 response scale for each aspect. We validate these estimates by comparing them to alternative methods for estimating preferences. Our findings provide empirical evidence that both complements and challenges philosophical perspectives on human desires and values. Our results support Aristotelian notions of eudaimonia through family relationships and Maslow’s emphasis on basic security needs, yet also suggest that contemporary theories of well-being may overemphasize abstract concepts such as happiness and life satisfaction, while undervaluing concrete aspects such as family well-being, financial security, and health, that respondents place the highest marginal utilities on. We document substantial heterogeneity in preferences across respondents within (but not between) demographic groups, with current SWB levels explaining a significant portion of the variation.</content>

    <title>No Country for Dying Firms: Evidence from India</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper identifies exit barriers as a new reason for India’s underdeveloped manufacturing sector. These barriers not only deter entry but also trap resources in unproductive firms. We document that Indian institutions generate such barriers and provide causal evidence of their effects. Using a dynamic model that separately identifies direct exit barriers from labor and capital adjustment costs, we find that exit barriers are quantitatively significant, particularly in low-performing states and labor-intensive industries. Our analysis yields three findings. First, reducing firing costs raises value added but reduces employment, whereas relaxing direct exit barriers increases both.  Second, simultaneous reform of labor firing costs and direct exit barriers yields synergies. Third, sequencing matters: addressing direct exit barriers before labor firing costs preserves employment while improving efficiency. Finally, we show that exit subsidies are more effective at raising value added, while entry subsidies are more effective at increasing employment.</content>

    <title>Advising Job Seekers in Occupations with Poor Prospects: A Field Experiment</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impact of online information provision to unemployed job seekers who are looking for work in occupations in slack markets, i.e. with only few vacancies per job seeker. Job seekers received suggestions about suitable alternative occupations, and how the prospects of these alternatives compare to their current occupation of interest. Some additionally received a link to a motivational video. We evaluate the interventions using a randomized field experiment covering all eligible job seekers registered to search in the target occupations. The vast majority of treated job seekers open the message revealing the alternative suggestions. The motivational video is rarely watched. Effects on unemployed job seekers in structurally poor labor markets are large: their employment, hours of work and labor income all improve by 5% to 6% after 18 months. Additional survey evidence shows that treated job seekers find employment in more diverse occupations.</content>

    <title>The Return of Adaptation to Extreme Weather</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the return of climate adaptation by modeling the uncertain impact of global warming for extreme weather.  Unexpected arrivals elevate extreme-weather risk, which leads households and firms to adapt and thereby lowering the damage of each subsequent arrival. Our approach provides country-specific estimates of disaster risk as extreme-weather events unfold, and state-dependent marginal effects of extreme-weather damage on economic growth. Applying our approach to cyclones and heatwaves from 1980-2019, average country income in 2019 is several percent lower absent state-dependent adaptation. Adaptation becomes significantly more valuable in the long run as the uncertainty regarding extreme weather is resolved.</content>

    <title>Income and Wealth Inequality in the United States: An Update Including the 2022 Wave</title>
    <updated>2025-05-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Moritz Kuhn &amp; José-Víctor Ríos-Rull</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a comprehensive overview of earnings, income and wealth inequality based on the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances  from the United States. We document the current state of inequality and its evolution over the last three decades organizing the data along key demographic dimensions including age, education, and marital status. The 2022 data reveal that wealth remains highly concentrated, with the top 1% holding 35% of total wealth down from a peak of 39% in 2016. This recent decline in wealth concentration—occurring despite rising income inequality—reflects strong housing price appreciation that disproportionately benefited middle-class households. We extend previous analyses with new perspectives on inequality, including: (1) the role of labor market segmentation in generating wealth disparities beyond standard employment categories; (2) differences in wealth accumulation across birth cohorts showing that younger  generations accumulate less wealth than their predecessors at comparable ages; (3) disparities associated with family structure, particularly the financial vulnerability of single-parent households; and (4) heterogeneity in self-reported savings motives, with precautionary savings dominating for lower-wealth households while retirement planning and bequests become more prominent at the top of the distribution. These findings enhance our understanding of the multifaceted nature of inequality and offer essential inputs for structural models and policy design.</content>

    <title>Tax Credits and Child Outcomes: Lessons from the U.S., U.K., and Canada</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over the last several decades, there have been historic shifts in the structure of cash transfer programs in Western, developed countries, including the U.S., Canada, and U.K. For all three of these countries, the turn of the 21st century marked a shift away from unconditional cash transfer programs like traditional cash welfare, towards an emphasis on benefits that encourage or require work. In this paper, I review the evidence on the impact of tax credits on child outcomes, focusing on what is known about child-oriented tax credits in the U.S. (EITC, CTC), the U.K. (WFTC, CTC, WTC), and Canada (Canada Child Tax Benefit (CCTB), National Child Benefit (NCB), and the Canada Child Benefit (CCB). Overwhelmingly, the evidence from these three countries suggests that tax credits have positive impacts on children on a host of different outcomes, including infant birthweight, childhood health and achievement, educational attainment, wages, and poverty in adulthood. While there is a large, growing body of evidence on the impact of these tax credits on children, future work should further investigate the precise mechanisms through which tax credits impact child outcomes, the characteristics of children most impacted by these credits, and the importance the frequency of credits distribution.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Innovation is central to models in economics, strategy, management, and finance, yet it remains difficult to measure due to its intangible and knowledge-based na ture. Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing offer new methods to analyze textual artifacts, providing empirical insights into previously hard-to-measure aspects of innovation. This paper provides an overview of the current applications of these methods in empirical innovation research, highlights their transformative potential for reshaping how researchers study and quantify innovation, and discusses the critical challenges that accompany their use.</content>

    <title>Local Projections or VARs? A Primer for Macroeconomists</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What should applied macroeconomists know about local projection (LP) and vector autoregression (VAR) impulse response estimators? The two methods share the same estimand, but in finite samples lie on opposite ends of a bias-variance trade-off. While the low bias of LPs comes at a quite steep variance cost, this cost must be paid to achieve robust uncertainty assessments. Hence, when the goal is to convey what can be learned about dynamic causal effects from the data, VARs should only be used with long lag lengths, ensuring equivalence with LP. For LP estimation, we provide guidance on selection of lag length and controls, bias correction, and confidence interval construction.</content>

    <title>Collateral and Secured Debt</title>
    <updated>2025-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We argue that firms’ assets, especially their tangible assets, serve as collateral restricting both secured and unsecured debt. Secured debt is explicitly collateralized, placing a lien on specific assets, which facilitates enforcement. Unsecured debt is backed by unencumbered assets and thus implicitly collateralized. The explicit collateralization of secured debt entails costs but enables higher leverage. Therefore, financially constrained firms use more secured debt both across and within firms. Our dynamic model is consistent with stylized facts on the relation between secured debt and measures of financial constraints and between leverage and tangible assets, and with evidence from a causal forest.</content>

    <title>Why Do Households Save and Work?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops and estimates a dynamic life-cycle model to quantify why households save and work. The model incorporates multiple sources of risk—health, marital status, wages, medical expenses, and mortality—as well as endogenous labor supply and human capital accumulation, retirement, and bequest motives at the death of the first and last household member. We estimate it using PSID and HRS data for the 1941–1945 cohort via the Method of Simulated Moments. Eliminating bequest motives reduces aggregate wealth by 23.8% and labor earnings by 1.2%; removing medical expenses lowers them by 13.1% and 0.7%. Wage risk is crucial for early-life saving: its removal reduces wealth by 10.4% but raises earnings by 2.3%. Eliminating marriage and divorce dynamics leads couples—numerous and wealthier—to save and work slightly less, and singles—fewer and poorer—to save and work considerably more. These effects largely offset in the aggregate. Removing all saving motives beyond retirement needs and lifespan uncertainty lowers wealth by 56.9% and earnings by 2.7%. These findings show that capturing multiple risks and behavioral margins jointly is essential to understanding household saving and labor supply.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does family breakdown and divorce affect spouses and their children? We provide new evidence using a matched difference-in-differences design in rich administrative data from New Zealand. While most outcomes remain stable prior to separation, parents' mental health deteriorates in the lead-up. At separation, men's employment falls while women's rises, and women become much more likely to receive government benefits. Men temporarily double their criminal offending; about a third of the increase is domestic disputes. Both parents become more likely to be the victim of non-domestic crime as well. As for mental health, parents become more anxious and depressed at separation, and these remain elevated well after the couple has parted. Their children, too, face increased risks after separation: anxiety, depression, school absenteeism, and crime victimization all rise.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate how advisors’ own health and survival assessments, and information about their advisees’ health and survival probabilities, shape their recommendations regarding retirement spending and investment. Using experiments involving amateur and professional advisors, we show that advisors’ self-assessments have only mild effects on their recommendations, but they do respond differently when provided longevity and health information about their advisees. Moreover, amateur advisors mainly react to simple cues, while professional advisors are more sensitive to client-specific information. While many rely on informal advice from friends or family, amateurs often cannot accurately analyze and utilize key information needed to provide suitable advice.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Non-Wage Competition on Corporate Profits</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most S&amp;P 500 corporations disclose that their profits depend on non-wage competition for worker talent via workplace amenities like work-life balance. We quantify this dependence using a labor market matching model with endogenous amenities. When productive (unproductive) firms provide the amenities demanded by workers at a lower cost, firm quality becomes more (less) dispersed relative to worker quality, which results in higher (lower) firm profits due to competition. This cost advantage is identified with data on wages, worker satisfaction, and firm scale. Calibrating our model to Glassdoor surveys, a 1% increase in workers’ non-pecuniary preferences raises firm profits by 0.6%.</content>

    <title>What Explains Growing Gender and Racial Education Gaps?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the 1960 cohort, American men and women graduated from college at similar rates, and this was true for Whites, Blacks and Hispanics. But in more recent cohorts, women graduate at much higher rates than men. Gaps between race/ethnic groups have also widened. To understand these patterns, we develop a model of individual and family decision-making where education, labor supply, marriage and fertility are all endogenous. Assuming stable preferences, our model explains changes in education for the ‘60-‘80 cohorts based on three exogenous factors: family background, labor market and marriage market constraints. We find changes in parental background account for 1/4 of the growth in women’s college graduation from the ’60 to ’80 cohort. The marriage market accounts for 1/5 and the labor market explains the rest. Thus, parent education plays an important role in generating social mobility, enabling us to predict future evolution of college graduation rates due to this factor. We predict White women’s graduation rate will plateau, while that of Hispanic and Black women will grow rapidly. But the aggregate graduation rate will grow very slowly due to the increasing Hispanic share of the population.</content>

    <title>A Quantitative Theory of Heterogeneous Returns to Wealth</title>
    <updated>2025-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent empirical evidence documents that different individuals earn systematically different rates of return, even after controlling for portfolio composition. We propose a general equilibrium theory of residual heterogeneity in rates of return on wealth by embedding a financial market with search frictions into a monetary incomplete-market model. We show that the distribution of rates of return offered in the financial market is endogenous and depends on the marginal product of capital, the return on fiat money, and the joint distribution of households across wealth and financial human capital. When calibrated, the model succeeds in reproducing the extent of residual dispersion in returns to wealth across individuals. We use the calibrated model to study various policies and counterfactuals, with a particular focus on monetary policy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stablecoins are cryptoassets which are designed to be pegged to the dollar, but are backed by imperfectly liquid USD assets. We show that stablecoins feature concentrated arbitrage: the largest issuer, Tether, only allows 6 agents in an average month to redeem stablecoins for cash. We argue that issuers' choice of arbitrage concentration reflects a tradeoff: efficient arbitrage improves stablecoin price stability in secondary markets, but amplifies run risks by reducing investors' price impact from selling stablecoins.  Our findings imply that policies designed to improve stablecoin price stability may have the unintended consequence of increasing stablecoin run risks.</content>

    <title>Artificial Intelligence and Technological Unemployment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How large is the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on labor productivity and unemployment? This paper introduces a labor-search model of technological unemployment, conceptualizing the generative aspect of AI as a learning-by-using technology. AI capability improves through machine learning from workers and in turn enhances their labor productivity, but eventually displaces workers if wage renegotiation fails. Three distinct equilibria emerge: no AI, some AI with higher unemployment, or unbounded AI with sustained endogenous growth and little impact on employment. By calibrating to the U.S. data, our model predicts more than threefold improvements in productivity in some-AI steady state, alongside a long-run employment loss of 23%, with half this loss occurring over the initial five-year transition. Plausible change in parameter values could lead to global and local indeterminacy. The mechanism highlights the considerable uncertainty of AI's impacts in the presence of labor-market frictions. In the unbounded-AI equilibrium, technological unemployment would not occur. We further show that equilibria are inefficient despite adherence to the Hosios condition. By improving job-finding rate and labor productivity, the optimal subsidy to jobs facing the replacement risk of AI can generate a welfare gain from 26.6% in the short run to over 50% in the long run.</content>

    <title>Collusion through Common Leadership</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies whether common leadership, defined as two firms sharing executives or board directors, contributes to collusion. Using an explicit measure of labor market collusion from unsealed court evidence, we find that the probability of collusion between two firms increases by 12 percentage points after the onset of common leadership, compared to a baseline rate of 1.2 percent in the absence of common leaders. These results are not driven by closeness of product or labor market competition. Our findings are consistent with the increasing attention toward common leadership under Clayton Act Section 8.</content>

    <title>Climbing the Energy Ladder: How Energy Resources Hinder, Facilitate, and Fuel Economic Growth</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I show that the nature of the energy resources available to an economy qualitatively determines long-run growth outcomes.  A harvested resource such as biomass drags on growth, a mined resource such as coal enables output per capita to hold constant, and both a tapped resource such as oil and a manufactured resource such as solar panels risk degrowth if energy return on energy invested (EROI) cannot stay above a threshold.  The only energy resource that can fuel long-run growth is a manufactured resource such as solar panels.  Either that resource must rely on substitutable energy inputs that have a sufficiently large EROI, or it must be produced by robots that are themselves produced from robots and energy.  Even in these cases, coal and oil economies may have been necessary stages on the way from a biomass economy to a solar economy.</content>

    <title>Job Sorting and the Labor Market Effects of a Criminal Record</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effects of a criminal record on labor market outcomes and the mediating role of job sorting using Swedish register data. Prime-age adults with criminal records earn about 30% less than observably similar adults without records and are concentrated in specific employers and occupations. To estimate the causal effect of a criminal record, we use an event study design that compares outcomes for adults charged with an offense for the first time to matched adults who were suspected of a similar offense but not charged. Acquiring a criminal record reduces months employed by 2% and annual earnings by 5%. These negative effects are: twice as large for more serious or subsequent charges, not driven by job displacement or incapacitation, and not mitigated by automatic record expungement, which typically occurs 5 or 10 years after case disposition. We classify firms by their propensity to hire workers with criminal records, holding suspected offense history fixed. A criminal record reduces employment at firms classified as less likely to hire workers with criminal records, increases employment at other firms, and decreases monthly wages across all firm types. Firm propensity to hire workers with criminal records varies substantially---even within industries---and is linked to firm size and managers' prior exposure to people with records. Leveraging manager moves across small firms, we find that when a firm hires a new manager with greater prior exposure to people with criminal records, it hires more people with records, with no detectable effect on productivity.</content>

    <title>Administrative Fragmentation in Health Care</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of reducing the administrative fragmentation of billing and payment, one commonly cited cause of inefficiency in US health care. We study a Medicare reform that consolidated billing processes across service types, using its staggered rollout and hospitals’ prior levels of administrative fragmentation for identification. The reform dramatically reduced fragmentation and modestly lowered claim denial rates but had no effect on spending, post-discharge care, or rehospitalizations. It also did not affect administrative costs or technology adoption. These findings suggest that addressing administrative fragmentation alone is unlikely to significantly improve health care efficiency.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study reviews the culture and institutions of Confucianism and explores their implications for the trajectory of China’s historical development. We trace the origins and evolution of the core elements of Confucianism and synthesize research on its relationship to clan culture, state institutions, and a broad array of societal values. We also highlight promising but underexplored directions for future research. While Confucianism is often invoked to explain China’s absence from the Industrial Revolution and its lack of democratization, we caution against such retrospective determinism. As a multidimensional and abstract tradition, Confucianism likely allows for varied interpretations and institutional adaptations across time and context.</content>

    <title>The Effects of Switching Electronic Health Record Developer on Specialty Referrals</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use national physician-pair panel data to examine how switching electronic health record (EHR) developers affects out-of-network referrals from primary care physicians (PCPs) to specialists. We estimate a difference-in-differences model, exploiting changes in EHR developer adoption by physicians’ affiliated hospitals. After a change in the PCP’s EHR developer, referrals to same-developer specialists increase by 5.8%, and referrals to specialists using the PCP’s prior EHR decrease by 4.2%. Referrals to the PCP’s most commonly referred-to specialists are not affected by changes in EHR developer, but shifts in referral patterns are particularly pronounced when the PCP is male and the specialist is female, when the PCP has more experience than the specialist and when the new EHR developer has a majority market share. These results are robust to estimation approaches that account for heterogenous treatment effects and physician selection into hospital systems. Our theoretical model indicates that PCP preferences for convenience may reduce referrals to the highest-quality specialists and lead to EHR market agglomeration, presenting a possible economic rationale for antitrust regulation of information blocking.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We assess how minimum wage effects on restaurant employment in the U.S. vary with labor market size and monopsony power. Using city-level data, we construct monopsony proxies based on labor flows and concentration. Minimum wages bind less in larger cities, consistent with the urban wage premium, and omitting this relationship overstates how labor market power reduces adverse employment effects of minimum wages. Nonetheless, accounting for city size, lower job market fluidity is linked to weaker negative employment effects, consistent with search models. By contrast, traditional concentration measures do not consistently predict variation in the effects of minimum wages.</content>

    <title>Trade and Industrial Policy in Supply Chains: Directed Technological Change in Rare Earths</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Trade and industrial policies, while primarily intended to support domestic industries, may unintentionally stimulate technological progress abroad. We document this mechanism in the case of rare earth elements (REEs) – critical inputs for manufacturing at the knowledge frontier, with low elasticity of substitution, inelastic supply, and high production and processing concentration. To assess the importance of REEs across industries, we construct an input-output table that includes disaggregated REE inputs. Using REE-related patents categorized by a large language model, sectoral TFP data, trade data, and physical and chemical substitution properties of REEs,  we show that the introduction of REE export restrictions by China led to a global surge in innovation and exports in REE-intensive downstream sectors outside of China. To rationalize these findings and quantify the global impact of the adverse REE supply shock, we develop a quantitative general equilibrium model of trade and directed technological change. We also propose a structural method to estimate sectoral input substitution elasticities for REEs from patent data and find REEs to be complementary inputs. Under endogenous technologies and with complementary inputs, input supply restrictions on REEs induce a surge in REE-enhancing innovation and lead to an expansion of REE-intensive downstream sectors.</content>

    <title>Monetary Stabilization of Sectoral Tariffs</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Central banks around the world have grappled with the question of how to respond to the mix of inflationary and output implications of a trade war. Recent tariff changes have impacted a wider cross-section of goods than was true in the previous tariff round, targeting final consumption goods in addition to materials such as aluminum and steel. This paper studies the optimal monetary stabilization of tariffs using a New Keynesian model enriched with comparative advantage between multiple traded sectors that differ in terms of tariff exposure as well as market structure and price rigidity. We find that, in the aggregate, the optimal monetary response is expansionary, supporting activity and producer prices at the cost of tolerating short-run headline inflation – both in response to tariffs aimed at differentiated consumption goods and to tariffs on non-differentiated goods. The output and export dynamics arising from tariffs on each sector differ sharply, as do the motivations for an expansionary monetary response. Sectoral reallocation is an order of magnitude larger than predicted by standard macro models featuring one tradable and one nontradable sector.</content>

    <title>Using Discrepancies to Correct for False Matches in Historical Linked Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a method to correct estimates from historical linked data for bias arising from type-I error—"false matches." We estimate the rate of false matching from the disagreement rate in characteristics that should agree across the two linked datasets. Combined with an understanding of the empirical patterns arising from false matches, knowledge of this rate enables us to correct for bias from false matches. Our method enables correction of estimates of both population moments and regression coefficients with valid inference. We illustrate the properties of our method via simulation and demonstrate them using linked US census data.</content>

We present new evidence that R&amp;D contracts not only finance innovation but also embed an implicit government guarantee of noncompetitive future procurement for the winning R&amp;D contractor. We measure its private value by analyzing stock market reactions to news about R&amp;D contract awards. Using all federal R&amp;D contracts awarded to U.S. publicly traded firms from 1984 through 2015, we find that the average private return on an R&amp;D contract is 19 times its maximum potential revenue. However, returns are highly skewed, with only 7.5% of firms receiving at least one top-quartile contract. Private returns are linked to future production contracts, but only for noncompetitive awards to vertically integrated or large firms. These results suggest that a procurement regime bundling R&amp;D and production contracts enhances value for firms with production capability. We develop a conceptual framework to clarify this innovation policy lever.</content>

    <title>Assessing Maximum Employment: A Flow-Based Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, to achieve maximum employment and stable prices, requires monitoring a broad range of  indicators and carefully evaluating the trade-offs between these goals. We propose a flow-based framework to evaluate real-time shortfalls from maximum employment, focusing on unemployment and participation cycles. This approach highlights that employment stability—driven by improved job-finding and reduced job-loss rates—is the primary factor behind procyclicality of participation, rather than labor force entry. Moreover, we show that cyclical recoveries in participation are bound to lag those in unemployment—even during fast recoveries. We link unemployment dynamics to price stability by estimating a New Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC) using data on labor market flows, prices, wages, and inflation expectations.  Our findings suggest that the natural rate of unemployment, u*, rose significantly following the pandemic, reflecting declines in job-filling rates, reduced matching efficiency, and a persistent increase in workers' real reservation wages. The model interprets the recent disinflation episode as a soft landing through rising expectations of a weaker labor market coinciding with the FOMC's tightening cycle. This observation emphasizes the  forward-looking nature of inflation dynamics.</content>

    <title>Information Spillovers within Couples: Evidence from a Sequential Survey of Spouses</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Little is known about the extent and drivers of information flow within couples, and whether spouses hold aligned expectations about the same outcomes. To provide new evidence, we conduct an online survey of 2,200 middle-aged married couples in the US. Our focus is on expectations about Social Security benefits. We first document misalignment in expectations: the correlation between partners’ beliefs about a given spouse’s Social Security benefits is 0.70, well below full agreement. We also show that this imperfect alignment is systematically associated with couple-specific characteristics. To establish causal evidence on information spillovers, we implement a randomized information experiment paired with a sequential survey design, where the index spouse receives targeted information, and the other is surveyed a few days later. Our findings reveal that information provided to the index spouse partially spills over to their partner, with the average treatment effect on the second spouse’s expectations being about half that observed for the index spouse. Using detailed survey data on measures of communication frictions, cognitive barriers, and the value of information, we identify key drivers of information flow. Spillovers are larger when communication barriers are low and when the information is particularly valuable. We also show that the information treatment enhances conditions for better intra-household decision-making. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of incorporating realistic communication frictions into models of household decision-making.</content>

    <title>Firm Premia and Match Effects in Pay vs. Amenities</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops a new approach to measuring non-wage amenities and compensating differentials in the labor market. Using a survey of 20,000 job movers in Denmark, we elicit workers’ reservation wage to return to their previous jobs. Our sample contains a large, connected network of firms, enabling us to estimate firm-wide premia and match effects in amenity values. Overall, higher-paying firms provide slightly worse non-pay amenities. Although they provide better perks and flexibility, they also come with higher layoff risk, faster work pace, and greater stress. On average, moves to jobs offering 10% higher pay involve a 5% reduction in the value of amenities, with 0.7% attributable to firm-wide tradeoffs and the remainder attributable to match effects in pay and preferences. Using a rich search model, we quantify the role of amenities in labor market inequality while accounting for preference heterogeneity and endogenous mobility. Worse amenities at high-paying firms offset more than half of their wage advantage, and the within-worker variance in pay across firms overstates the variance in utility by 50%.</content>

    <title>America's Housing Supply Problem: The Closing of the Suburban Frontier?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Housing prices across much of America have hit historic highs, while less housing is being built. If the U.S. housing stock had expanded at the same rate from 2000-2020 as it did from 1980-2000, there would be 15 million more housing units. This paper analyzes the decline of America’s new housing supply, focusing on large sunbelt markets such as Atlanta, Dallas, Miami and Phoenix that were once building superstars. New housing growth rates have decreased and converged across these and many other metros, and prices have risen most where new supply has fallen the most. A model illustrates that structural estimation of long-term supply elasticity is difficult because variables that make places more attractive are likely to change neighborhood composition, which itself is likely to influence permitting. Our framework also suggests that as barriers to building become more important and heterogeneous across place, the positive connection between building and home prices and the negative connection between building and density will both attenuate. We document both of these trends throughout America’s housing markets. In the sunbelt, these changes manifest as substantially less building in lower density census tracts with higher home prices. America’s suburban frontier appears to be closing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We discuss a wide range of measures of social heterogeneity, both theoretically and empirically. In our framework, individuals who differ from each other either in terms of their identity traits or of their cultural values experience antagonism toward each other. Depending on the type of interpersonal differences that may give rise to social antagonism, we derive a wide range of microfounded measures of social heterogeneity, many of which have been frequently used in the social sciences to characterize the causes and effects of socially relevant differences between individuals. Using these measures, we explore the worldwide landscape of social heterogeneity. We end our discussion with a consideration of the social, political and economic effects of these various metrics of heterogeneity.</content>

    <title>Racial Disparities in Mortality by Sex, Age, and Cause of Death</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Racial differences in mortality are large, persistent and likely caused, at least in part, by racism. While the causal pathways linking racism to mortality are conceptually well defined, empirical evidence to support causal claims related to its effect on health is incomplete. In this study, we provide a unique set of facts about racial disparities in mortality that all theories of racism and health need to confront to be convincing. We measure racial disparities in mortality between ages 40 and 80 for both males and females and for several causes of death and, measure how those disparities change with age. Estimates indicate that racial disparities in mortality grow with age but at a decreasing rate. Estimates also indicate that the source of racial disparities in mortality changes with age, sex and cause of death. For men in their fifties, racial disparities in mortality are primarily caused by disparities in deaths due to external causes.  For both sexes, it is racial disparities in death from healthcare amenable causes that are the main cause of racial disparities in mortality between ages 55 and 75. Notably, racial disparities in cancer and other causes of death are relatively small even though these causes of death account for over half of all deaths. Adjusting for economic resources and health largely eliminate racial disparities in mortality at all ages and the mediating effect of these factors grows with age. The pattern of results suggests that, to the extent that racism influences health, it is primarily through racism’s effect on investments to treat healthcare amenable diseases that cause racial disparities in mortality.</content>

    <title>Republican Support and Economic Hardship: The Enduring Effects of the Opioid Epidemic</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we establish a causal connection between two of the most salient social developments in the United States over the past decades: the opioid epidemic and  the political realignment between the Republican and Democratic parties. Drawing on unsealed records from litigation against Purdue Pharma, we uncover rich geographic variation in the marketing of prescription opioids that serves as a quasi-exogenous source of exposure to the epidemic. We use this variation to document significant increases in drug-related mortality and greater reliance on public transfer programs. This induced economic hardship led to substantial changes in the political landscape of the communities most affected by the opioid epidemic. We estimate that from the mid-2000s to 2022, exposure to the opioid epidemic continuously increased the Republican vote share in House, presidential, and gubernatorial elections. By the 2022 House elections, a one-standard-deviation increase in our measure of exposure  led to a 4.5 percentage point increase in the Republican vote share. From 2012 until 2022, this increase in the House vote share translated into Republicans winning additional seats.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Salary negotiations are a widespread phenomenon that can shape key labor market outcomes, such as welfare and inequality. We provide novel empirical and theoretical insights into the causes and consequences of salary negotiations. We conducted two field experiments involving over 3,100 job seekers in the U.S. tech sector, designed to examine two types of information frictions. We find that a light-touch encouragement intervention significantly increased both negotiation attempts and compensation gains. In contrast, providing a substantial discount on negotiation coaching did not significantly affect negotiation attempts. Women responded more strongly to both interventions, helping to narrow gender gaps. We develop a new model of salary negotiations, incorporating risk and information frictions, that can better explain our experimental and non-experimental findings. The model's equilibrium analysis indicates that policies encouraging negotiation can enhance both welfare and equity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore changes in product quality during France’s major liberalization episode of the mid-nineteenth century.  Using new data and existing techniques from the international trade literature, we investigate the relative quality of French products versus those of international competitors, within industry changes in quality, and within product quality changes. France produced relatively high quality/high unit value products in the traded sector throughout the period. Liberalization was associated with an overall decline in the quality of French exports. However, some of the best-selling exports experienced an apparent rise in quality around the time of liberalization. As for imports, while French spending may have switched to lower quality products due to liberalization, lower tariffs were associated with rising within product quality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Market definition is essential for antitrust analysis, but challenging in settings with network effects, where substitution patterns depend on changes in network size. To address this challenge, we conduct an incentivized experiment to measure substitution patterns for TikTok, a popular social media platform. Our experiment, conducted during a time of high uncertainty about a potential U.S. TikTok ban, compares changes in the valuation of other social apps under individual and collective TikTok deactivations. Consistent with a simple framework, the valuations of alternative social apps increase more in response to a collective TikTok ban than to an individual TikTok deactivation. Our framework and estimates highlight that individual and collective treatments can even lead to qualitatively different conclusions about which alternative goods are substitutes.</content>

    <title>Financial Firepower: School Shootings and the Strategic Contributions of Pro-Gun PACs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fatal school shootings often spark support for stricter gun laws, threatening the gun lobby’s influence and agenda. To prevent political fallout, do pro-gun Political Action Committees increase contributions after fatal school shootings? Leveraging a novel dataset of pro-gun PAC contributions and school shooting incidents, we implement a difference-in-differences design with staggered treatment adoption to estimate the causal effect of school shootings on contributions to House candidates. We find that pro-gun PACs increase contributions by 30.2% to candidates in districts with fatal school shootings, but show no significant response to non-fatal school shootings or other mass shootings. The temporal pattern reveals strategic behavior: contribution spikes emerge in the wake of fatal school shootings and in proximity to elections, with effects dramatically amplified as Election Day approaches; within two months of Election Day, contributions increase by 1,730%. These effects are concentrated in competitive districts (margins of 5%). Our findings provide robust evidence that pro-gun PACs deploy targeted financial contributions in response to school shootings, with the magnitude and timing suggesting a strategic counter-mobilization effort to maintain influence in affected districts when gun policy becomes locally salient and elections are near. Our findings underscore a gap in democratic accountability: while public opinion should drive policy change, organized interests with financial power can insulate political candidates from public pressure and obstruct its translation into legislative reform.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Private minibuses dominate transport in many developing country cities. They serve 62% of trips in Lagos, the largest city in sub-Saharan Africa. We collect panel data to measure how private minibuses respond to the rollout of a new public bus network. When the government enters a route, minibuses depart less frequently, driver profits fall, and drivers switch to connected routes, reducing prices. We develop a custom app to estimate how commuters trade off prices and wait times in an RCT. The private response harms commuters on treated routes, who wait longer, but benefits those on connected routes, who face only lower prices. Overall, 10% of the commuter welfare gains of building the public transit system arise from the response of private transit. Drivers lose welfare equal to half of the commuter gains.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The classic tariff formula states that the optimal unilateral tariff equals the inverse of the foreign export supply elasticity. We generalize this result and show that an intertemporal tariff formula characterizes the efficient tariff in a large class of dynamic heterogeneous agent (HA) economies with multiple goods. Intertemporal export supply elasticities and relative tariff revenue weights are sufficient statistics for the optimal tariff that decentralizes the efficient allocation. We also develop a general theory of second-best optimal tariffs. In dynamic HA incomplete markets economies, Ramsey optimal tariffs trade off intertemporal terms of trade manipulation against production efficiency, risk-sharing, and redistribution. Intertemporal export supply elasticities and relative tariff revenue weights remain sufficient statistics for the intertemporal terms of trade manipulation motive of second-best optimal tariffs. We apply our results to a quantitative heterogeneous agent New Keynesian (HANK) model with trade.</content>

    <title>Public Debt Bubbles, Liquidity, and Risk: Policy Assessments Based on the Zero-Beta Interest Rate</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies stationary equilibria in a novel class of analytically tractable incomplete markets models with a public debt bubble (meaning that the interest rate r̅ on riskfree government bonds is less than the growth rate). Within the models, the return rᴋ to physical capital can exceed r̅  because capital is exposed to aggregate risk and because it is less liquid than public debt. I follow di Tella et al. (2024), and define r_zero to be the zero-beta interest rate (on an asset with no aggregate risk and the same (il)liquidity properties as physical capital). I provide two distinct sufficient conditions in a zero-growth economy under which the government can increase welfare by following a fiscal policy which induces a higher r̅ . The first case is that r_zero &lt; 0 (which also implies that r̅ &lt; 0). The second case is that r̅ &lt; 0 and r_zero (on average) satisfies the aggregate consumption Euler equation. I argue that the estimates of r_zero in di Tella et al. (2024) are in alignment with this second case.</content>

    <title>Capability Inversion: The Turing Test Meets Information Design</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper analyzes the design of tests to distinguish human from artificial intelligence through the lens of information design. We identify a fundamental asymmetry: while AI systems can strategically underperform to mimic human limitations, they cannot overperform beyond their capabilities. This leads to our main contribution—the concept of capability inversion domains, where AIs fail detection not through inferior performance, but by performing “suspiciously well” when they overestimate human capabilities. We show that if an AI significantly overestimates human ability in even one domain, it cannot reliably pass an optimally designed test. This insight reverses conventional intuition: effective tests should target not what humans do well, but the specific patterns of human imperfection that AIs systematically misunderstand. We identify structural sources of persistent misperception—including the difficulty of learning about failure from successful examples and fundamental differences in embodied experience—that make certain capability inversions exploitable for detection even as AI systems improve.</content>

    <title>From Tank to Odometer: Winners and Losers from a Gas-to-VMT Tax Shift</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the increase in fuel economy of the personal transportation fleet along with the increased penetration of hybrid and electric vehicles, federal motor vehicle fuel excise tax revenue has been steadily declining. This has led to calls for finding a replacement for this tax. One option is to replace the gas tax with a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) tax. To investigate the impact of such a tax swap, we combine data from the 2017 National Household Transportation Survey (NHTS) and the American Community Survey (ACS). Using machine learning techniques, we generate estimates of VMT and gasoline tax collections at the census tract level. This allows us to explore the distributional implications of this tax swap at a geographically disaggregated level. We find, as have previous researchers, that this tax swap is modestly progressive. Our more granular geographic analysis highlights striking disparities not previously reported. We find that rural areas and census tracts in the center of the country generally benefit from this tax swap, while urban and bicoastal areas generally experience higher taxation. Additionally, Republican-leaning districts, which overlap significantly with rural areas, see marked gains compared to Democratic districts.</content>

We randomize 200 dollars of basic income per month for two years within a non-urban disadvantaged sample tracked using high-frequency administrative data. The amount provided is 21% of average all-source income. In the short term (0.5 years after baseline), relative to the control group, treatment-group employment decreases by 58%, average all-source income remains constant, and health-investment rates increase. In the longer term (1.25 years after baseline), employment and health-investment rates revert to their control-group counterparts. Treatment participants receive basic income, take time off work, address health needs, and, subsequently, reintegrate into employment.</content>

    <title>Medicare Drug Price Negotiations May Not Reduce Patient Cost Sharing for Most Users of Targeted Drugs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies two major changes in the financing of Part D drugs for Medicare due to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).  Effective 2025 it capped out of pocket (OOP) payments at $2000 per year, and effective 2026 it will pay lower prices (negotiated by Medicare) for 10 targeted costly and effective drugs.  This paper uses a large representative claims sample to explore the combined effect of these two provisions on the marginal cost sharing that affects beneficiaries’ access to these drugs.  While many beneficiaries will be expected to see lower marginal OOP prices, we find that a majority of those using the targeted drugs will face either no change in their marginal OOP or, in a large fraction of cases, an increase in their dollar cost sharing per additional unit of use.  This happens even when beneficiaries see reductions in their annual OOP cost because of the nonlinear nature of cost sharing in the Medicare Part D drug.</content>

    <title>Inflation Dynamics with a Generalized Lucas Phillips Curve</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I investigate a generalized form of the Lucas (1972) Phillips curve, in which firms take varying amounts of time to learn aggregate demand, in standard textbook new-Keynesian models. This Phillips curve helps to reconcile the sharp divergence between the standard model on the one hand and the beliefs of most policy analysts and the available evidence on the other. In the standard model, inflation and output rise after interest rates rise, with only the possibility of a one-time downward jump. With the generalized Lucas Phillips curve, inflation is initially unstable, so a small initial disinflation builds up before turning around. The model preserves the desirable long-run stability and neutrality of the standard model.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage newly linked data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis to study transactions within U.S. multinational enterprises (MNEs). We show that using administrative data on intrafirm trade allows us to correct for measurement error in survey data and to identify the positive relationship between input-output (IO) linkages and the probability of trade between U.S. parents and their foreign affiliates. We also document the prevalence of intrafirm trade: more than half (three-quarters) of affiliates worldwide (in North America) export to or import from their U.S. parent. Our findings provide strong empirical support for traditional theories of firm boundaries that predict trade between vertically linked units of the same firm, and underscore the importance of accounting for the trade frictions that shape MNEs’ regional supply chains.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We experimentally test two seminal hypotheses on the impact of competition on firms' management upgrading. In a first experiment, we protect firms from labor market competition by reducing the risk that a freshly trained manager would be poached by a rival firm. We find that this protection does not increase firms’ investment in management training. In a second suite of experiments, we boost perceived product market competition by informing firms either that rival firms have received management training or that foreign firms are gaining easier access to the domestic market. Again, we find no evidence that this increases firms’ average willingness to invest in management training. To explain why firms do not feel threatened by competition, we present evidence suggesting that, in contrast to commonly held assumptions, firm managers in our setting hold a mental model of competition that posits positive—instead of negative—spillovers, arising primarily from differentiation.</content>

    <title>Post-Pandemic Global Inflation, Disinflation, and Central Bank Policy Responses: A Review of the Facts, Empirical Findings, and their Implications for Monetary Policy Framework Assessments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the 2021-2022 global inflation surge and the belated but aggressive monetary policy response to it by advanced economy central banks. Drawing on body of recent empirical research, it identifies three primary drivers of the global inflation surge: supply shocks from pandemic disruptions and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, accommodative fiscal and monetary policies that responded to the economic dislocation caused by pandemic, and a demand shift toward goods relative to services, that exacerbated supply chain pressures. Advanced economy central banks were initially slow to react but ultimately raised rates aggressively and succeeded, with help from a reversal of the initial supply shocks which contributed to the initial inflation surge, in returning inflation to “2 point something” were confident enough in the prospects for further disinflation to began cutting interest rates by the summer of 2024. The paper explores benefits and costs of proposals to make forward guidance on the policy rate and the balance sheet more robust and considers the benefits and costs of incorporating scenario analysis into the communication toolkit.</content>

    <title>Do Vaping Taxes Tip the Scale? The Effect of E-Cigarette Taxation on Obesity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A large literature documents that quitting cigarette smoking may lead to weight gain because nicotine is an appetite suppressant and metabolic stimulant. However, researchers in this literature emphasize that the health benefits of smoking cessation exceed the harms from the weight typically gained. New products, such as electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), that deliver nicotine with a lower health risk than combustible cigarettes could conceivably alter this tradeoff in favor of nicotine use. Accordingly, this study asks whether a leading policy tool to curb ENDS use – ENDS taxes – has the unintended consequence of causing weight gain. We find that, despite reducing nicotine vaping, ENDS taxes lead to robust reductions in weight and body mass index among female teens. A one-dollar (per mL of e-liquid) increase in the ENDS tax rate (2023$) leads to a 0.8-1.0 percentage-point decline in the probability that a female youth is obese. For male teens and both female and male adults, the estimated impacts are generally smaller and statistically indistinguishable from zero. An investigation of mechanisms reveals possible explanations for the absence of weight gain from ENDS taxes. The first is ENDS-tax-induced substitution to cigarettes, which offsets reductions in nicotine consumption from ENDS. The second is indirect effects on weight-related behaviors, including reductions in alcohol and marijuana use and increased healthier food consumption.</content>

    <title>Global Price Shocks and International Monetary Coordination</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Individual central banks respond to global supply shocks that transmit inflationary pressures—such as oil prices, shipping costs, and bottlenecks in global supply chains—taking these conditions as given. However, their combined global response determines global demand and, thus, the resulting global price pressure. This paper builds a simple monetary open economy model to explore the economic implications of this channel. We show that, following a negative world supply shock, uncoordinated monetary policy may be excessively loose. Our mechanism for this “expansionary bias” applies to an aggregate shock in a symmetric world economy of small open economies having no individual control over their terms of trade. In these ways, it is distinct from asymmetric shocks and terms-of-trade manipulation motives emphasized in the monetary coordination literature.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The process of development is accompanied by marked changes in the structure of the labor market. We lay out a broad set of stylized features that distinguish developing country labor markets from those in richer countries. We organize our review around one particularly striking difference: in poor countries, working age individuals are employed in wage work only 20-50% of the time. There is evidence that this low wage employment reflects high levels of involuntary unemployment (often masked by self-employment), along with frictions such as wage rigidity, market power, and search and matching frictions. At the same time, there is growing documentation that workers prefer self-employment or unemployment to many of the wage jobs that are available to them, especially low-skill work in the formal sector. We offer evidence on several ways in which poverty itself can dampen labor supply, so that "low" labor supply may itself be an outcome of under-development. Throughout our review, we highlight how three core aspects of poverty—missing markets, the importance of social ties, and institutional irregularity—are important for understanding why developing country labor markets may behave differently from those in richer settings. This has relevance for understanding how labor markets change in response to, and help facilitate, the process of development.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider the political consequences of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) by online platforms engaged in social media content dissemination, entertainment, or electronic commerce. We identify two distinct but complementary mechanisms, the social media channel and the digital ads channel, which together and separately contribute to the polarization of voters and consequently the polarization of parties. First, AI-driven recommendations aimed at maximizing user engagement on platforms create echo chambers (or “filter bubbles”) that increase the likelihood that individuals are not confronted with counter-attitudinal content. Consequently, social media engagement makes voters more polarized, and then parties respond by becoming more polarized themselves. Second, we show that party competition can encourage platforms to rely more on targeted digital ads for monetization (as opposed to a subscription-based business model), and such ads in turn make the electorate more polarized, further contributing to the polarization of parties. These effects do not arise when one party is dominant, in which case the profit-maximizing business model of the platform is subscription-based. We discuss the impact regulations can have on the polarizing effects of AI-powered online platforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on the social safety net examines its effects on recipients and their families. We show that these effects extend beyond recipients’ families. Using a regression discontinuity design and administrative data, we study a Danish policy that cut welfare benefits for refugees, increasing crime among affected individuals. Linking refugees to neighbors, we find increased crime among non-Danish neighbors, with spillovers persisting even after direct effects stabilize. Accounting for these spillovers raises the marginal value of public funds by 20%. We explore several mechanisms and find evidence consistent with peer effects among young individuals from the same country of origin.</content>

    <title>Does Matching Contribution Incentivize Informal Workers to Participate in Retirement Saving Plans? A Randomized Evaluation Interacted with a Natural Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conducted a large field experiment in Peru on informal workers and studied whether offering them a matching contribution raise participation and contributions in their Individual Retirement Accounts. We had three groups: a control group receiving no match, and two treatments groups receiving 50 and 100 percent match, respectively. Additionally, due to the time span, we can also analyze the difference responses between pre and during Covid-19. The results were as follows. First, the match incentive increases participation. Workers in the 50 and 100 percent match groups show participation rates of 5.2 and 6.5 p.p. higher than workers in the control group, respectively. The participation effect is also present pre Covid-19 and disappears during it. Second, the 100 percent match incentive was the only effective in increasing savings among all individuals (1.4 p.p.), pre (2.3 p.p.) and during Covid-19 (0.97 p.p.). This effect still presents in LATE specification with higher p.p. Third, 100% match was again the only effective to make contribute more than once, in the full sample (1.2 p.p.), and pre Covid-19 (2.7 p.p.), including LATE specification (full sample – 5.6 p.p.; pre Covid-19 – 8.2p.p.). Fourth the 50 percent match is not effective in raising contribution in any specification.</content>

    <title>A Theory of Endogenous Degrowth and Environmental Sustainability</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop and quantify a novel growth theory in which economic activity endogenously shifts from material production to quality improvements. Consumers derive utility from goods with differing environmental footprints: necessities are material-intensive and polluting, while luxuries are more service-based and emit less. Innovation can be directed toward either material productivity or product~quality. Because demand for luxuries is more sensitive to quality, the economy gradually becomes “weightless”: growth is driven by quality improvements, services become the dominant employment sector, and material production stabilizes at a finite level. This structural transformation enables rising living standards with declining environmental intensity, providing an endogenous path to degrowth in material output without compromising economic progress. Policy can accelerate the transition, but its burden is uneven, falling more heavily on the poor than on the rich.</content>

    <title>Using AI to Generate Option C Scaling Ideas: A Case Study in Early Education</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, field experiments have reshaped policy worldwide, but scaling ideas remains a thorny challenge. Perhaps the most important issue facing policymakers today is deciding which ideas to scale. One approach to attenuate this information problem is to augment traditional A/B experimental designs to address questions of scalability from the beginning. List 2024 denotes this approach as “Option C” thinking. Using early education as a case study, we show how AI can overcome a critical barrier in Option C thinking – generating viable options for scaling experimentation. By integrating AI-driven insights, this approach strengthens the link between controlled trials and large-scale implementation, ensuring the production of policy-based evidence for effective decision-making.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data on 2.5 million great-grandchildren linked to their great-grandfathers in the US (1850–1940), we show that economic gaps persisted strongly across four generations despite major structural change. We find that one-third of the initial differences in economic status across white great-grandfathers remained in their great-grandchildren. When including both Black and white families, this persistence rises to about 50 percent, largely because the gap between Black and white families closed slowly over time. Grandparent and great-grandparent status matter beyond the father's status, indicating slower convergence to the mean than predicted by two-generational estimates. However, this excess persistence is largely driven by enduring racial inequality as grandparent effects are small within the white population.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A college degree offers a pathway to economic mobility for low-income students. Using a multi-site randomized controlled trial combined with administrative and survey data, we demonstrate that intensive advising during high school and college significantly increases bachelor’s degree attainment among lower-income students. We leverage unique data on pre-advising college preferences and causal forest methods to show that these gains are primarily driven by improvements in initial enrollment quality. Our results suggest that strategies targeting college choice may be a more effective and efficient means of increasing degree attainment than those focused solely on affordability.</content>

    <title>The Neoclassical Theory of Firm Investment and Taxes: A Reassessment</title>
    <updated>2025-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Gabriel Chodorow-Reich</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economists have widely varying opinions of how corporate taxation affects aggregate investment, output, and wages. This disagreement reflects a 60-year history of misapplication of the neoclassical theory of investment to interpret empirical work and guide policy analysis. In this article I reconsider the accumulated evidence relating tax policy to firm investment through the lens of the neoclassical theory. Empirical work suggests a range for the firm-level, short-run semi-elasticity of the investment-to-capital ratio to the user cost of -0.25 to -0.75. The mid-point of this range translates into values for the elasticity of firm revenue to capital of between 0.22 and 0.35. The implied general equilibrium, long-run elasticity of capital to the user cost can differ substantially from leading policy models. The elasticity of the wage to the user cost ranges from -0.3 to -0.7, or from -0.1 to -0.2 for changes to the user cost in the C-corporate sector alone. In the relatively low-tax regime in the U.S. in 2024, the neoclassical contribution to higher output from higher capital cannot rationalize more than modest dynamic tax revenue offsets from further reductions in corporate taxation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social desirability bias (SDB) is a pervasive threat to the validity of survey and experimental data. Respondents might often misreport sensitive attitudes and behaviors to appear more socially acceptable. We begin by synthesizing empirical evidence on the prevalence and magnitude of SDB across various domains, focusing on studies with individual-level benchmarks. We then critically assess commonly used strategies to mitigate SDB, highlighting how they can sometimes fail by creating confusion or inadvertently increasing perceived sensitivity. To help researchers navigate these challenges, we offer practical guidance on selecting the most suitable tools for different research contexts. Finally, we examine how SDB can distort treatment effects in experiments and discuss mitigation strategies.</content>

We show that bequests and other intergenerational transfers are prevalent in most countries, that they are sometimes motivated by altruism and sometimes by selfishness, that they affect the consumption and saving behavior of households to some extent, especially that of elderly households, that they affect the labor supply behavior of households, especially that of bequest recipients, and that they have important policy implications.</content>

    <title>Scalable Targeting of Social Protection: When Do Algorithms Out-Perform Surveys and Community Knowledge?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Innovations in big data and algorithms are enabling new approaches to target interventions at scale. We compare the accuracy of three different systems for identifying the poor to receive benefit transfers — proxy means-testing, nominations from community members, and an algorithmic approach using machine learning to predict poverty using mobile phone usage behavior — and study how their cost-effectiveness varies with the scale and scope of the program. We collect mobile phone records from all major telecom operators in Bangladesh and conduct community-based wealth rankings and detailed consumption surveys of 5,000 households, to select the 22,000 poorest households for $300 transfers from 106,000 listed households. While proxy-means testing is most accurate, algorithmic targeting becomes more cost-effective for national-scale programs where large numbers of households have to be screened. We explore the external validity of these insights using survey data and mobile phone records data from Togo, and cross-country information on benefit transfer programs from the World Bank.</content>

    <title>Who Benefits from Paid Family Leave? The Impact on Informal and Formal Care for Middle-Aged and Older Adults with Disabilities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper analyzes the impact of paid family leave (PFL) policies on informal and formal care for middle-aged and older adults with disabilities in the U.S., and how the heterogeneous benefits accrue to different families. We use data from the 1998-2018 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and leverage the PFL programs implemented in California (2004), New Jersey (2009), and New York (2018) in a difference-in-differences (DiD) design. We deploy both the conventional two-way fixed effects (TWFE) model and an adapted DiD estimator developed by Sun and Abraham for staggered rollout designs. We find that PFL access is associated with a 5.7 percentage point increase in the likelihood that individuals with disabilities receive informal care from their children. We also show that PFL access significantly increases the use of home care services and nursing home care. These effects are primarily concentrated among individuals with disabilities who have both a spouse and children, and are almost non-existent among those who have only children and no spouse. Our findings demonstrate that PFL policies improve care access and help address unmet care needs for middle-aged and older adults with disabilities, but their impact remains limited for certain vulnerable subgroups, particularly those with only children.</content>

    <title>Nicotine Vaping and Youth Mental Health: New Evidence from E-Cigarette Regulations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The confluence of a youth mental health crisis and high rates of teenage nicotine vaping has led some U.S. tobacco control advocates to argue that reducing access to electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) — through policies such as ENDS taxation — may improve youth and young adult mental health. Using data from several nationally representative surveys (Youth Risk Behavior Survey, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health) and a generalized difference-in-differences approach, we find no evidence that ENDS taxation improves youth and young adult mental health. With 95 percent confidence, we can rule out that the mean state ENDS tax increase adopted during our analysis sample ($0.34 per mL of e-liquid in 2023$) reduces persistent depressive symptoms among youths by more than 0.3 percent and suicide ideation by more than 1.0 percent. Moreover, discrete-time hazard models provide little evidence that ENDS taxes affect dynamics in youth mental health. A similar pattern of results emerges when we examine a wider set of ENDS regulations, including minimum legal purchasing ages, e-cigarette licensure laws, online sales restrictions, and restrictions on indoor nicotine vaping.</content>

    <title>Defaulting 401(k) Assets into Payout Annuities for “Pretty Good” Lifetime Incomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Some US defined contribution plans offer retirees access to an annuity or lifetime income stream as payout options from their 401(k) accounts. Nevertheless, for behavioral reasons, some retirees  may hesitate to elect lifetime income streams as a drawdown vehicle. To counter this, plan sponsors could automatically allocate a portion of retirees’ 401(k) assets to annuities, now that regulatory barriers to doing so have eased. Using a lifecycle economic model, we evaluate the pros and cons of defaulting retirees’ 401(k) assets into payout annuities. We show that defaulting 20% of a retiree’s assets over a threshold into an immediate annuity enhances retirement security for most plan participants. An annuity deferred to the age of 80 is particularly beneficial to college graduates, in terms of enhancing their welfare</content>

    <title>Firm Investment and the User Cost of Capital: New U.S. Corporate Tax Reform Evidence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) marked the first time in three decades that material changes were made to the corporate tax code of the United States. We use TCJA as a quasi natural experiment to estimate the impact of changes in user cost of capital on investment. Following the method of Auerbach and Hassett (1991), using cross-sectional data we find that the user cost is associated with higher rates of investment consistent with previous studies. BEA asset types with greater reductions in user cost of capital and marginal effective tax rate (METR) after the 2017 TCJA had greater statistically significant increases in their investment rates several years after the tax reform. Specifically, we find the magnitude of a 1 percentage point decrease in user cost is associated with a 1.68 to 3.05 percentage point increase in the rate of investment, larger than prior estimates of the responsiveness of investment with respect to user cost of capital.</content>

    <title>Childless or Child-fewer? Childlessness and Parity Progression where Fertility is Below Replacement</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Birth rates are falling worldwide, in every region. Falling birth rates can be decomposed into two components: (1) an increase in childlessness (i.e., lifetime nulliparity), and (2) fewer children ever born to women who have at least one child (completed cohort fertility among the parous). This paper quantifies the contributions of these two components for women in advanced economies in Europe, North and South America, and southeast Asia, and for recent cohorts in Indian districts. In both samples, we find that the birth rate among parous women is an important component in explaining low overall birth rates. Childlessness explains only 38% of the decline in cohort fertility in the advanced economies in our analysis. In the Indian context, childlessness accounts for only 6% of the difference between high-fertility and below-replacement districts. Moreover, in many country-cohorts and Indian districts, average completed cohort fertility would be below the replacement threshold even when considering only women who do have children—that is, omitting the zeros from the average. This is in tension with widespread recent narratives that attribute falling birth rates to increasing childlessness: To the contrary, in many populations average birth rates even among parents would be low enough eventually to cause depopulation.</content>

    <title>Efficiency in Job-Ladder Models</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the efficiency of a decentralized equilibrium in a broad class of random-search job-ladder models. We decompose the source of inefficiency into two margins: (i) the investment margin, that is, the difference between the private and social benefit of job creation given the surplus of a match, and (ii) the valuation margin, that is, the difference between the private valuation and the social valuation of a match surplus. In the presence of on-the-job searches, the well-known Hosios condition no longer guarantees the market equilibrium aligns with the efficient allocation along both margins. On-the-job searches contribute to the overvaluation of the match surplus in market equilibrium, especially at the top of the job ladder. Consequently, the decentralized equilibrium with the Hosios condition features excess creation of vacancies in the steady state. On-the-job searches also lead to excess volatility in unemployment in response to aggregate productivity shocks. Quantitatively, we find a significant difference between the equilibrium outcome and the efficient allocation under standard calibration. We also consider several decentralizations of the efficient allocation to shed light on the optimal policies under the frictional labor market.</content>

    <title>‘Sorting’ Out Gender Discrimination and Disadvantage: Evidence from Student Evaluations of Teaching</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How should gender discrimination and systemic disadvantage be addressed when more discriminatory and less generous students systematically sort into certain fields, courses, and instructors’ sections? In this paper, we estimate measures of gender bias and evaluation generosity at the student level by examining the gap between how a student rates male and female instructors, controlling for professor fixed effects. Accounting for measurement error, we find significant variation in gender bias and generosity across students. Furthermore, we uncover that bias varies systematically by gender and field of study and that patterns of sorting are sufficiently large to place female faculty at a substantive disadvantage in some fields and male faculty at a disadvantage in others. Finally, we document that sexist attitudes are predictive of gender-based sorting and propose Empirical Bayes inspired measures of student-level bias to correct for instructor-specific advantages and disadvantages caused by sorting.</content>

    <title>Wildfire, Smoke and Mental Health in Canada</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the relationship between wildfires and mental health-related hospitalizations in Canada from 2006 to 2018. Most previous estimates of the mental health costs of wildfire have focused on the impacts of exposure to PM₂.₅. We break new ground by highlighting other pathways for wildfires to affect mental health, including evacuation orders, direct local costs of fires, and climate anxiety, which is proxied using wildfire-related Twitter activity. We find that all these mechanisms affect mental health-related hospitalizations, with especially large impacts on hospitalizations for anxiety and substance abuse. Conditional on air quality, wildfire events that draw national attention worsen the mental health of susceptible people, even when they live far away. Elderly people and those with pre-existing health conditions that make them more vulnerable, are more strongly affected. The results indicate that climate anxiety stoked by wildfire events may account for much of the overall mental health cost. Accounting for these additional mechanisms does little to diminish the estimated effect of PM ₂.₅ from wildfire smoke, however, suggesting that the additional factors have effects on mental health that are in addition to those of PM₂.₅.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how the GDPR affected transatlantic venture investment. Using investment data from 2014 to 2019, we find that the GDPR’s rollout in May 2018 led to a significant decline in US investor activity in the EU, evidenced by fewer deals and investment, especially for newer and data-related ventures. Investors shifted toward geographically closer ventures and relied more on syndication, particularly with EU-based lead investors. While the shift to local investing drove the overall decline, syndication partially offset it. The results highlight the role of digital policies in shaping investment strategies and influencing transatlantic capital flows.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building on recent advances in the literature on knowledge creation and innovation (notably Carnehl and Schneider (2025), we propose a novel general equilibrium model that explicitly incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) as a decision-enhancing technology capable of interpolating between known points of knowledge. Our framework formalises the trade-off between AI’s coverage— its ability to span wider knowledge gaps—and its accuracy, and reveals the surprising result that, beyond producing immediate productivity gains, AI fundamentally alters the novelty of research. Specifically, when AI systems offer sufficiently broad coverage, they incentivise exploratory research that taps into novel, distant areas of knowledge and accelerates long-run growth; conversely, limited coverage promotes incremental research that may boost short-term efficiency while dampening the overall advancement of new ideas. Moreover, our analysis uncovers that the type of knowledge—whether novel or dense—plays a critical role in determining both the growth and welfare implications of AI, charting a new path for understanding how knowledge influences research strategies. By also examining the roles of market structure, licensing arrangements, and regulatory frameworks, our work contributes new, policy-relevant insights that reconcile the immediate benefits of AI adoption with the demands of sustainable long-term economic expansion.</content>

    <title>Long-term Vertical Contracts, Geography, and the Persistence of Brand Shares</title>
    <updated>2025-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Previous research highlights persistent differences in national brand market shares across regions, driven by geographic consumer preferences and early entry advantages (Bronnenberg et al. 2007, 2009). This study investigates the extent to which long-term vertical contracts can explain the observed geographic dispersion and persistence of national brand dominance. Using NielsenIQ data from the same product categories as Bronnenberg et al. (2007), we follow Abowd et al. (1999) to decompose the variance in brand shares into Brand × Retailer and Brand × Market effects. Results show that 50% of the variance is explained by retailer effects, compared to 20% by market effects. This suggests that some retailers use vertical contracts that favor a specific brand across all markets in which they compete, such as exclusive-dealing, slotting allowances, or category-captaincy contracts, and that these play a key role in sustaining national brand dominance documented in prior literature. By emphasizing how retailer-specific factors drive observed patterns, we complement demand-side explanations and shift attention to supply-side factors that could affect competition.</content>

    <title>Abortion Restrictions and Intimate Partner Violence in the Dobbs Era</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In overturning Roe v. Wade and triggering laws in many states that ban or severely restrict abortions, the Supreme Court’s landmark 2022 Dobbs decision dramatically altered the landscape for reproductive health in the U.S. Prior research has highlighted the far-reaching impact of abortion restrictions for women and families, which extend beyond their proximate effects on abortions, births, and fertility. We provide some of the first causal evidence on how abortion restrictions in the post-Dobbs era have impacted women’s risk of exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV is the most common form of violence experienced by women, and changes in access to abortion may generate unintended effects on various inputs (economic resources, stress, intra-household bargaining) that could affect relationship dynamics and raise the risk of IPV. Leveraging information on IPV incidents reported to law enforcement from 2017-2023 combined with post-Dobbs changes in county-level travel distance to abortion facilities, analyses are based on a generalized difference-in-differences approach. We find that abortion restrictions – alternately measured by the increase in travel distance and by the presence of a near-total ban – significantly increased the rate of IPV for reproductive-aged women in treated counties on the order of about seven to 10 percent. These estimates imply at least 9,000 additional incidents of IPV among women in the treated “trigger ban” states, which would be predicted to add over $1.24 billion in social costs.</content>

    <title>Measuring Industrial Policy: A Text-Based Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Since the 18th century, policymakers have debated the merits of industrial policy (IP). Yet, economists lack basic facts about its use due to measurement challenges. We propose a new approach to IP measurement based on information contained in policy text. We show how off-the-shelf supervised machine learning tools can be used to categorize industrial policies at scale. Using this approach, we validate longstanding concerns with earlier approaches to measurement which conflate IP with other types of policy. We apply our methodology to a global database of commercial policy descriptions, and provide a first look at IP use at the country, industry, and year levels (2010-2022). The new data on IP suggest that i) IP is on the rise; ii) modern IP tends to use subsidies and export promotion measures as opposed to tariffs; iii) rich countries heavily dominate IP use; iv) IP tends to target sectors with an established comparative advantage, particularly in high-income countries.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When job tasks are automated, does this augment or diminish the value of labor in the tasks that remain? We argue the answer depends on whether removing tasks raises or reduces the expertise required for remaining non-automated tasks. Since the same task may be relatively expert in one occupation and inexpert in another, automation can simultaneously replace experts in some occupations while augmenting expertise in others. We propose a conceptual model of occupational task bundling that predicts that changing occupational expertise requirements have countervailing wage and employment effects: automation that decreases expertise requirements reduces wages but permits the entry of less expert workers; automation that raises requirements raises wages but reduces the set of qualified workers. We develop a novel, content-agnostic method for measuring job task expertise, and we use it to quantify changes in occupational expertise demands over four decades attributable to job task removal and addition. We document that automation has raised wages and reduced employment in occupations where it eliminated inexpert tasks, but lowered wages and increased employment in occupations where it eliminated expert tasks. These effects are distinct from—and in the case of employment, opposite to—the effects of changing task quantities. The expertise framework resolves the puzzle of why routine task automation has lowered employment but often raised wages in routine task-intensive occupations. It provides a general tool for analyzing how task automation and new task creation reshape the scarcity value of human expertise within and across occupations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show long-term Treasury convenience yields are more sensitive to changes in Treasury supply than short-term Treasury convenience yields. The fiscal expansion in the past two decades and the resultant increase in Treasury supply depressed convenience yields heterogeneously across maturities — driving them close to zero for short-term Treasurys and into negative territory for long-term Treasurys. As a result, the aggregate seigniorage revenue earned by the U.S. from issuing safe and liquid financial assets has declined by a third. Issuing only short-term Treasurys could preserve the seigniorage revenue earned from Treasury convenience yields but would expose the government to more rollover risk.</content>

    <title>Controlling Collective Attention: Flooding versus Focusing by Politicians</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a model of strategic information provision where politicians choose how to allocate limited disclosure across multiple policy dimensions. Citizens are heterogeneous statistical learners who interpret data differently, following Liang (2021). Our key insight: spreading information thinly across many dimensions (“flooding the zone”) maximizes disagreement among citizens, preventing the coordination needed for collective accountability. We characterize equilibrium disclosure strategies and show that politicians with unfavorable private information flood to prevent investigation, while those with favorable information choose intermediate disclosure levels that balance reputation building with enabling scrutiny. The model yields both pooling equilibria that create “transparency theater”—where all politicians provide vast but shallow information—and separating equilibria where disclosure strategies reveal type. We derive threshold conditions showing that flooding dominates when investigation stakes are asymmetric, communication technology enables high dimensionality, and citizen populations are heterogeneous in their information processing. Extensions examine strategic interactions between competing politicians and the mediating role of information platforms in either amplifying or constraining flooding strategies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A smaller human population would emit less carbon, other things equal, but how large is the effect? Here we test the widely-shared view that an important benefit of the ongoing, global decline in fertility will be reductions in long-run temperatures. We contrast a baseline of global depopulation (the most likely future) with a counterfactual in which the world population continues to grow for two more centuries. Although the two population paths differ by billions of people in 2200, we find that the implied temperatures would differ by less than one tenth of a degree C—far too small to impact climate goals. Timing drives the result. Depopulation is coming within the 21st century, but not for decades. Fertility shifts take generations to meaningfully change population size, by which time per capita emissions are projected to have significantly declined, even under pessimistic policy assumptions. Meanwhile, a smaller population slows the non-rival innovation that powers improvements in long-run productivity and living standards, an effect we estimate to be quantitatively important. Once the possibility of large-scale net-negative emissions is accounted for, even the sign of the population-temperature link becomes ambiguous. Humans cause greenhouse gas emissions, but human depopulation, starting in a few decades, will not meet today’s climate challenges.</content>

    <title>The Longevity of Older Wives and Their Husbands: Comparing Actual Couples with Synthetic Couples</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), we construct two measures of the longevity of older wives and husbands. For definiteness, we focus on couples in which the wife was 60 and the husband 62 in 1988. Our first measure utilizes a 4 x 4 "longevity matrix" in which the bins correspond to the decades in which the spouses died. For example, an entry in the (3,2) bin indicates that the wife died in the 3rd decade (between ages 80 and 89) and the husband in the second decade (between ages 72 and 81). Our second measures use the Gompertz distribution to estimate the censored observations from the NHIS. We use the Gompertz estimates of age-specific mortalities to construct joint and survivor life expectancies for the couples in our working sample. We compare the longevity estimates based on actual couples from the NHIS with estimates based on synthetic couples constructed from the 1988 CDC life tables. Research based on randomly formed synthetic couples constructed from CDC life table data shows that the randomness of mortality and the overlap between spouses' age-specific mortality distributions imply dramatically long life spans for surviving spouses. The 4 x 4 longevity matrices show that longevity effects are magnified at the level of the couple by assortative marriage.</content>

    <title>The Labor Supply Curve is Upward Sloping: The Effects of Immigrant-Induced Demand Shocks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What is the effect of immigration on native labor-market outcomes? An extensive literature identifies the differential impact of immigration on natives employed in jobs that are more exposed to immigrant labor (supply exposure). But immigrants consume in addition to producing output. Despite this, no literature identifies the impact on natives employed in jobs that are more exposed to immigrant consumption (demand exposure). We study native labor-market effects of supply and demand exposures to immigration. Theoretically, we formalize both measures of exposure and solve for their effects on native wages. Empirically, we combine employer-employee data with a newly collected dataset covering electronic payments for the universe of residents in Norway to measure supply and demand exposures of all native workers to immigration induced by EU expansions in 2004 and 2007. We find large, positive, and persistent effects of demand exposure to EU expansion on native worker income.</content>

    <title>Macro Shocks and Firm-Level Response Heterogeneity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Macro shocks produce high dispersion in firm-level equity returns, sales growth, and other outcomes. We show that this dispersion reflects observable differences in business characteristics. To do so, we combine firm-level returns on stock market ``jump" days with text about business risks in prior 10-K filings to construct firm-specific shock exposures. Our exposure measures explain firm-level abnormal returns through interpretable variation in language. They also explain most of the increased dispersion in firm-level revenue growth after major shocks and much of the dispersion in employment growth, investment rates, and earnings surprises. Our evidence yields a novel interpretation for countercyclical dispersion, highlighting the key role of heterogeneous business characteristics in macro shock transmission.</content>

    <title>Economic Models of Cultural Transmission</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this chapter we survey recent advances in modeling cultural transmission in the economics literature. We first present the basic canonical model of the evolution of cultural traits in the social sciences. Both Economics and Evolutionary anthropology build on this canonical model but their approaches are conceptually very different. After elucidating these differences, we introduce several recent economic models of cultural transmission which address a rich set of novel and interesting questions in the literature. We present these models as extensions of the canonical framework, organized along theoretical dimensions that we categorize as pertaining to preferences and technology. We finally briefly discuss how cultural evolution represents a fundamental component - alongside institutional change - of recent theoretical work on the political economy of long-run growth. We conclude suggesting interesting areas for future research.</content>

    <title>Production Function Estimation without Invertibility: Imperfectly Competitive Environments and Demand Shocks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We advance the proxy variable approach to production function estimation. We show that the invertibility assumption at its heart is testable. We characterize what goes wrong if invertibility fails and what can still be done. We show that rethinking how the estimation procedure is implemented either eliminates or mitigates the bias that arises if invertibility fails. Furthermore, we show how a modification of the procedure ensures Neyman orthogonality, enhancing efficiency and robustness by rendering the asymptotic distribution of the GMM estimator in the second step of the estimation procedure invariant to estimation noise from the first step.</content>

    <title>Group Health Insurance Versus ACA Marketplaces: Selection, Subsidies, and Welfare</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Affordable Care Act (ACA) changed incentives for individual and employer-sponsored insurance. Using unique small group market (SGM) data with detailed claims and enrollment information, we analyze the welfare gains across households in the SGM from alternative formulations of ACA health insurance exchanges (HIXs). Accounting for observable heterogeneity increases estimated demand elasticities. Shutting down the SGM would reduce equilibrium adverse selection in HIX-type markets, increasing welfare for households moved to HIXs by $842 annually. The majority of households would obtain higher equilibrium welfare from HIXs, stemming from having more choices. Adding the 2014 ACA penalties only modestly decreases adverse selection.</content>

    <title>Medical School Closures, Market Adjustment, and Mortality in the Flexner Report Era</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Early twentieth century efforts to overhaul the quality of medical education in the United States (principally between 1905 and 1915 – the “Flexner Report Era”) led to a steep decline in the number of medical schools and medical school graduates. In this paper, we examine the consequences of these medical school closures be- tween 1900 and 1930 for county-level physicians, nurses, and midwives per capita as well as for infant, non-infant, and total mortality. To do so, we construct a school closure intensity measure for all counties in the United States, combining variation in (i) distance from closures, (ii) the historical number of graduates from closing schools, and (iii) the timing of closures. Nearby medical school closures (within 300 miles) led to a 4% reduction in physicians per capita, even after physician market adjustment through physician migration and postponed retirement. Strikingly, we find that medical school closures led infant mortality rates to decline by 8% and non- infant mortality rates to decline by 4%, suggesting that reducing the supply of poorly trained physicians may have reduced mortality.</content>

    <title>Cosmetology Gets a Trim: The Impact of Reducing Licensing Hours on Colleges and Students</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the United States, licenses are required for entry into many different occupations. Requirements vary by state and occupation, but many licenses require a minimum number of training or instructional hours. We consider the impact of these hours requirements on students and postsecondary institutions, with a particular focus on cosmetology (also known as hairstyling or beauty). Cosmetology licensing requires extensive training hours (between 500 and 2,100 hours) in every state and typically exceeds the time required for similar licenses. We implement a difference-in-difference design based on state-level changes in required licensing hours for cosmetologists between 2011 and 2019. We ask how and whether changes to hours requirements influence student outcomes and institutional behavior. We find that lowering required hours is likely beneficial for students, as it raises completion, lowers tuition, and expands enrollment among some groups of students. Larger institutions appear to reduce their tuition by less than smaller institutions. We find no detectable effects on the earnings of cosmetologists.</content>

    <title>Health Insurance Protections and Ex Ante Moral Hazard in Risky Health Behaviors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the goal of lowering incentives for alcohol and substance abuse, U.S. states have historically permitted private health insurers to deny reimbursement of medical claims stemming from alcohol or opioid impairment. However, a potential unintended consequence of such “exclusion provisions” is that they may reduce providers’ incentives to screen patients for alcohol intoxication and substance abuse, leading to an increase in risky health behaviors that carry substantial externality costs.  In response to these concerns, 16 states and the District of Columbia repealed their exclusion provisions and replaced them with explicit prohibitions on the denial of health insurance claims resulting from alcohol and other substance use impairment (PDHIAs). This study is the first to comprehensively explore the effects of PDHIAs on alcohol- and drug- related outcomes, with a particular focus on externalities associated with these risky health behaviors, allowing us to broadly assess their potential welfare effects. Leveraging a variety of national data sources (Uniform Crime Reports, Fatality Analysis Reporting System, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Treatment Episode Data Set, and Medical Expenditure Panel Survey) in conjunction with a generalized difference-in-differences approach, we find little support for the hypothesis that PDHIAs generated ex ante moral hazard. To the contrary, there is some evidence that PDHIAs may have reduced some criminal arrests, drunk driving behaviors, and alcohol use. One explanation for these findings is that physicians may be more willing to refer treatment services for substance use-related health issues when patients and hospitals are not financially penalized by PDHIAs. Lastly, there is little evidence that PDHIAs had broader impacts on private insurance markets, either in affecting private health insurance coverage or average premiums.</content>

    <title>Transition to Green Technology along the Supply Chain</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze a model of green technological transition along a supply chain. The model generates a unique equilibrium for given initial conditions but multiple steady-states. We show that: (i) even in the presence of Pigouvian environmental taxation, targeted sectoral subsidies are generally necessary to implement the social optimum; (ii) small, targeted industrial policy may bring large welfare gains; (iii) a government which is unable to subsidize greenification in more than one sector or price carbon at its true social cost should primarily target downstream sectors; (iv) over-investing in greenification in the wrong upstream branch may derail the overall transition towards greenification. Finally, we calibrate our model to decarbonization of heavy duty transportation (trucking, aviation, etc.) via hydrogen. We find that, absent industrial policy, the economy can get stuck in the “wrong” steady-state with CO₂ emissions vastly above the social optimum even with a Pigouvian carbon price in place.</content>
