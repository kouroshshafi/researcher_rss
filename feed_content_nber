    <title>College Major Restrictions and Student Stratification</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Underrepresented minority (URM) college students have been steadily earning degrees in relatively less lucrative fields of study since the mid-1990s. A decomposition reveals that this widening gap is principally explained by rising stratification at public research universities, many of which increasingly prevent students with poor introductory grades from declaring popular majors. We investigate these major restriction policies by constructing a novel 50-year dataset covering four public research universities' student transcripts and employing a staggered difference-in-difference design around the implementation of 25 GPA-based restrictions. Restrictions disproportionately filter out less-prepared students with fewer pre-college academic opportunities, decreasing average URM enrollment shares by 20 percent. They do not measurably improve allocative efficiency across majors, departments' wage value-added, or filtered students' educational attainment. Using first-term course enrollments to identify students who intend to earn restricted majors, we find that major restrictions disproportionately lead URM students toward less lucrative majors, explaining nearly all growth in within-institution ethnic stratification since the 1990s.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What sparked humanity’s leap from stagnation to prosperity? What lies at the core of inequality among nations? Unified Growth Theory explores the evolution of societies over the entire course of human history. It uncovers the universal wheels of change that have governed the journey of humanity, driven the growth process, and shaped inequality across the globe. The theory sheds light on two of the most fundamental mysteries surrounding this journey: (i) The Mystery of Growth—the origins of the dramatic transformation in human prosperity over the past two centuries, in the wake of millennia of near stagnation; and (ii) The Mystery of Inequality—the roots of the vast inequality in the wealth of nations. The theory suggests that forces operating in the distant past are central to the understanding of the uneven development across the globe and the design of effective policies that could promote economic growth and mitigate inequality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how the concept of embedded culture played a transformative role in the ongoing cultural revolution within economics and business. We trace the field's shift from the 20th-century concept of homo economicus universalis to an approach incorporating cultural embeddedness in economic behavior. Beyond documenting this intellectual transformation, we identify fertile areas for future research and explore how an embedded cultural perspective can enhance both our understanding of economic phenomena and the design of effective policies.</content>

    <title>Gender Inequality in the Labor Market: Continuing Progress?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article examines the trends in women’s economic outcomes in the United States focusing primarily on labor force participation, occupational attainment, and the gender wage gap. The author first highlights considerable progress on all dimensions prior to the 1990s followed by a slowing or stalling of gains thereafter, with a plateauing of female labor force participation trends and a slowing of women’s occupational and wage convergence with men. She considers the likelihood of a resumption of progress in narrowing gender gaps in these areas, concluding it is unlikely without policy intervention. She then considers some new policy initiatives addressing work-family issues and labor market discrimination that may hold potential for increasing female labor force participation and narrowing gender inequities in the labor market.</content>

    <title>Winners and Losers from the Work-from-Home Technology Boon</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We model how an increase in Work-from-Home (WFH) productivity differentially affects workers using a framework in which some workers cannot work offsite, some are hybrid, and some are completely remote.  The improvement in WFH productivity increases housing demand and thus housing prices since housing is inelastically supplied.  Because workers in non-telecommutable occupations must consume housing but their total factor productivity does not increase,  the rise in house prices reduces their welfare. The welfare decline is equivalent to 1-9% of consumption, depending on how substitutable WFH is with onsite work, and it arises despite measured income of all workers increasing.</content>

    <title>The Relationship between Officer Misconduct and Conviction-less Arrests</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Given the use of an individual’s arrest history for many economic and social outcomes, reducing conviction‐less arrests (arrests that result in no charges or where the defendant is found not guilty) is an important policy goal. This paper examines which officers are making conviction‐less arrests, and whether these arrests can be reduced with increased oversight. Using the Chicago Police Department’s rotational duty calendar to obtain plausibly exogenous variation in the set of officers assigned to work on a particular day, we find that arrests made by officers with high misconduct are 10.5% less likely than the arrests made by no‐misconduct officers to result in charges and are 14% more likely to have a “Not Guilty” outcome. We also analyze two events that increased the transparency of police misconduct through public disclosure of complaint records and find that increased oversight reduces conviction‐less arrests, but with important nuances across misconduct profiles. While no‐ and low‐misconduct officers are responsive to oversight mechanisms, high‐misconduct officers are less responsive.</content>

    <title>Transition Risk: Sources and Policy Responses</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Transition risk – the financial stability risk related with decarbonization – is a major source of concern. The literature has so far only studied transition risk caused by carbon tax shocks. This paper explores other potential sources of transition risk: two other policy sources – subsidies to abatement or to green producers – and two preference-based sources – a shock to consumer preferences and a shock to investor preferences. We develop an environmental dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model that includes a frictional financial sector, and we consider macroprudential policy responses to transition risks. These different shocks have different effects on the possibility of transition risk and lead to different macroprudential policy implications.</content>

    <title>Phoning Home: The Procurement of Telecommunications for Incarcerated Individuals in the United States</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Incarcerated individuals in the U.S. purchase goods and services from monopoly vendors selected by their correctional authority. We study telecommunications, which have come under bipartisan scrutiny due to the high prices inmates pay for phone calls. Prospective providers are evaluated on their technical capabilities, the prices they would charge, and the “commission” they would pay the correctional authority. Using data from public records requests, we estimate a first-score auction model with evaluation uncertainty and multi-dimensional bidder heterogeneity. The model indicates that reducing the role of commissions in procurement lowers prices, whereas increasing competition among providers mainly raises commissions. Moreover, recent federal regulations that ban commissions and cap prices likely preserve providers' profitability.</content>

    <title>On the Definition and Estimation of Economic Resilience using Counterfactuals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper defines the first measure of economic resilience based on the cumulative current and future losses a shock-exposed household experiences relative to a counterfactual measure of what household economic well-being would have been absent the shock. Drawing on the rich economics literature on the sensitivity of household income and consumption to shocks, we derive a resilience metric that can be estimated with panel data using standard impact evaluation methods. To illustrate these methods, we first use simulated data from a dynamic optimization model and a known data generation process. We show how this metric can be used to not only evaluate the impact of different policies on resilience but also to judge the public finance efficacy by showing how the cumulative avoided loss based resilience measure can be used for cost-benefit analysis. We then we illustrate how to use these methods to calculate resilience at the household level and show that reliance on income as a measure of economic well-being may be wiser in the absence of long-term data. Finally, We then use data from a recent experiment in Eastern and Southern Africa to show that these methods can be informative even with relatively short duration data.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does the ability to generate verifiable digital financial histories, with customers having data-sharing rights, improve credit access? We answer this using India’s launch of an Open-Banking based public digital payment infrastructure (UPI). Using rarely available data on the universe of consumer loans we show credit increases by both fintechs (new entrants) and banks (incumbents), on the intensive and extensive margin, including increased credit to subprime and new-to-credit customers. We show several mechanisms at play: low-cost internet improves credit access, lenders weigh in digital histories, and digital payments with Open Banking effectively complement first-time bank accounts enabling access to formal credit.</content>

    <title>Diffusion in Social Networks: Experimental Evidence on Information Sharing vs Persuasion</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a clustered randomized controlled trial across 180 villages in Uttar Pradesh, India, to promote the take-up of a savings commitment product newly introduced to our study population. A random subset of participants was targeted through our promotional campaign to test whether the product's diffusion among untargeted participants operates primarily through information sharing or through persuasion by incentivized target participants. If social learning is the main channel of diffusion, we would expect higher sign-up and take-up rates in information villages compared to persuasion villages. Conversely, if persuasion is the primary channel, sign-up and take-up rates should be higher in persuasion villages. Our findings consistently favor the persuasion channel, as sign-up and take-up rates were higher in the persuasion treatment, even without increased financial literacy or knowledge about the product. Information alone had a negligible impact on take-up, while the combined treatment achieved the highest sign-up and conversion rates, suggesting that information complements persuasion by enhancing its effectiveness. These results highlight the importance of incentivized persuasion in promoting product take-up and suggest that, in certain contexts, direct information-sharing may be less effective than previously assumed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mental health disorders are the leading cause of childhood disability worldwide. We examine the impact of a relatively common household stressor on child mental health: the presence of a younger sibling with a physical disability. Using Danish administrative data from families with at least 3 children, we focus on differences between first and second born children in families with and without a 3rd child with a disability. Second-born children in these families spend a larger fraction of their early childhood in families that may be under stress. We find that second-born children are 11 percent more likely to use mental health services than first-born children. There is a 19% increase in psychiatric visits and a 16% increase in use of psychiatric medications. These results are confirmed by matching models.</content>

    <title>Consumer Preferences for Cigarettes and Heated Tobacco Products in Japan: Evidence from a Discrete Choice Experiment</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Heated tobacco products (HTPs), a harm reducing cigarette alternative, gained popularity over the past decade and appear to have contributed significantly to the reduction of smoking in Japan. While the increased popularity of HTPs suggests a consumer preference for cigarette alternatives, there is a limited understanding of how consumers choose between different tobacco products. Understanding consumer choice is especially salient given the evolving policy landscape and proposals to increase HTP taxes. This study uses a large discrete choice experiment to examine the decision-making processes of smokers in Japan when choosing between cigarettes, HTPs, and quitting. We assess the influence of various product attributes such as prices, flavors, nicotine content, and warning messages on these choices. The findings reveal that prices and flavors significantly influence smokers' preferences. Specifically, higher HTP prices tend to drive smokers back to combustible cigarettes and discourage them from choosing to quit. Additionally, there is some evidence that consumers prefer HTPs with a wide variety of flavors. Meanwhile, hypothetical policy simulations that change warning messages or nicotine content do not affect consumers' choices.</content>

    <title>The Ethics of Pollution Pricing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We survey various ethical issues related to the use of pollution pricing.  While pollution pricing, for example in the form of Pigouvian taxes or cap-and-trade systems, is widely used in environmental economics modeling, many moral and ethical assumptions lie behind those models, and many ethical objections to pollution pricing are disregarded. We hope this review will be helpful to environmental economists who are regularly engaged in the use of such models, and in economic reasoning more generally, but who are less familiar with their ethical underpinnings and possible implications.</content>

    <title>The Dynamic Fiscal Costs of Outsourcing Health Insurance - Evidence from Medicaid</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Setting payment rates for providers contracted over multiple periods is a persistent challenge in government procurement. We study the dynamics of fiscal costs following the outsourcing of Medicaid provision to private health insurers by states. We focus on beneficiaries with disabilities who account for a third of Medicaid's spending. Using a national administrative database, we identify county-level private plan enrollment mandates and exploit them as an instrument for individuals' transition to managed care plans. These transitions, while initially slightly reducing fiscal costs, lead to a continuous increase in Medicaid's costs over subsequent years. Counties subject to mandates experience a 9.8% higher cost four years post-mandate compared to those without mandates. "Actuarially sound" endogenous payment rates, that are based on past costs in the market, may serve as mechanism underlying the rising spending.</content>

    <title>Highway Procurement During the Great Recession and Stimulus</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study highway procurement in Texas during the Great Recession and stimulus period, finding increased competition with more bidders and lower bids. We argue that the recession reduced opportunity costs, in part due to a slump in private-sector construction. We evaluate costs and efficiency by developing methods to estimate an empirical auction model tailored for public bidding and demonstrate that contracts became more efficient and less costly. A counterfactual analysis confirms that infrastructure procurement during recessions not only stimulates the economy but also enables the government to complete necessary projects at lower costs.</content>

    <title>Risk Loving and Fat Tails in the Wealth Distribution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the dynamic properties of the wealth distribution in an overlapping generations model with warm-glow bequests and heterogeneous attitudes towards risk. Some dynasties of agents are risk averters, and others are risk lovers. Agents can invest in two types of Lucas trees. The two types of trees are symmetric in the sense that one type has a high return in states where the other has a return of zero. This symmetry allows risk averters to perfectly ensure their future income and eliminates aggregate uncertainty in the model. Furthermore, risk lovers take extreme portfolio positions, which make it easy for us to characterize the evolution of their wealth holdings over time. We show that the model has an equilibrium in which the aggregate wealth distribution converges to a unique invariant distribution. The invariant distribution of wealth of the risk lovers has fat tails for high bequest rates. The existence of fat tails is endogenously generated by the behavior of risk lovers rather than by the exogenous existence of fat tails in the endowments or in the returns of the assets.</content>

    <title>From Competitors to Partners: Banks’ Venture Investments in Fintech</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We hypothesize and find evidence that banks use venture investments in fintech startups as a strategic approach to navigate fintech competition. We show that banks’ venture investments have increasingly focused on fintech firms in systematic ways. We find that banks facing greater fintech competition are more likely to make venture investments in fintech startups. Banks target fintech firms that exhibit higher levels of asset complementarities with their own business. Finally, instrumental variable analyses show that venture investments increase the likelihood of operational collaborations and knowledge transfer between the bank investor and the fintech investee.</content>

    <title>Instrumental Variables with Time-Varying Exposure: New Estimates of Revascularization Effects on Quality of Life</title>
    <updated>2024-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The ISCHEMIA Trial randomly assigned patients with ischemic heart disease to an invasive treatment strategy centered on revascularization with a control group assigned non-invasive medical therapy. As is common in such “strategy trials,” many participants assigned to treatment remained untreated while many assigned to control crossed over into treatment. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses of strategy trials preserve randomization-based comparisons, but ITT effects are diluted by non-compliance. Conventional per-protocol analyses that condition on treatment received are likely biased by discarding random assignment. In trials where compliance choices are made shortly after assignment, instrumental variables (IV) methods solve both problems—recovering an undiluted average causal effect of treatment for treated subjects who comply with trial protocol. In ISCHEMIA, however, some controls were revascularized as long as five years after random assignment. This paper extends the IV framework for strategy trials, allowing for such dynamic non-random compliance behavior. IV estimates of long-run revascularization effects on quality of life are markedly larger than previously reported ITT and per-protocol estimates. We also show how to estimate complier characteristics in a dynamic-treatment setting. These estimates reveal increasing selection bias in naive time-varying per-protocol estimates of revascularization effects. Compliers have baseline health similar to that of the study population, while control-group crossovers are far sicker.</content>

    <title>Handling Endogenous Marketing Mix Regressors in Correlated Heterogeneous Panels with Copula Augmented Mean Group Estimation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Endogeneity is a primary concern when evaluating causal effects using observational panel data. While unit-specific intercepts control for unobserved time-invariant confounders, dependence between (i) regressors (e.g., marketing mix strategy of interests) and the current error term (regressor endogeneity) and/or between (ii) regressors and heterogeneous slope coefficients (slope endogeneity) can introduce significant estimation bias, resulting in misleading inference. This paper proposes a two-stage copula endogeneity correction mean group (2sCOPE-MG) estimator for panel data models, simultaneously addressing both endogeneity concerns. We generalize the IV-free copula control function, employing a general location Gaussian copula that effectively captures the panel structure. The heterogeneous coefficients are treated as unit-specific fixed parameters without distributional assumptions. Consequently, the 2sCOPE-MG estimator allows for arbitrary dependence structure between heterogeneous coefficients and regressors. Unlike Haschka (2022), 2sCOPE-MG requires neither a normal error distribution nor a Gaussian copula regressor-error dependence structure and is more robust, easier to implement, and capable of addressing slope endogeneity. The 2sCOPE-MG estimator is extended to dynamic panels, where intertemporal dependence in the outcome process can be suitably captured. We study its asymptotic properties and provide an analytical variance formula for inference without the need to bootstrap. For short dynamic panels, a Jackknife bias-corrected 2sCOPE-MG estimator is provided to ensure unbiased inference. The usage of the 2sCOPE-MG estimator is demonstrated by Monte Carlo simulations and a marketing mix response application across 21 categories to account for regressor and slope endogeneities in store-panel sales data.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We survey and summarize recent literature on labor unions in political economy. While labor unions have been a long-standing subject of study in labor and macroeconomics, until recently they have been less studied by political economists, despite being important political actors in many policy-relevant contexts. We first organize the literature into work on the external influence of unions on the political system, including effects on voting, campaign finance, lobbying, and intraparty bargaining. We then discuss work on the internal politics and organization of unions, including issues of selection and representation, union aggregation of preferences. We pay special attention to the economic and political effects of public sector unions. We also discuss union behavior in weakly institutionalized contexts, where crime, corruption, rent-seeking, political strikes, and violence are all issues. We conclude with directions for future work.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Until the beginning of this century, the GATT/WTO system worked. Economic research provided a compelling explanation. It showed that if governments maximize the well-being of their own countries broadly defined, GATT/WTO principles would facilitate mutually beneficial cooperation over their trade policy choices. Now heightened geopolitical rivalry seems to have undermined the WTO. A simple transposition of the previous rationalization suggests that geopolitics and trade cooperation are not compatible. We show that this is only true if rivalry eclipses any consideration of own-country well-being. In all other circumstances, there are gains from trade cooperation even with geopolitics. Furthermore, the WTO’s relevance is in question only if it adheres too rigidly to its existing rules and norms. Through measured adaptation to the geopolitical imperative, the WTO can continue to thrive as a forum for multilateral trade cooperation in the age of geopolitics.</content>

    <title>Collective Bargaining, Unions, and the Wage Structure: An International Perspective</title>
    <updated>2024-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we assess the recent economics literature on collective bargaining. Despite a declining trend in the OECD in coverage and especially union membership, a large share of formal workers around the world are still covered by collective bargaining agreements. We describe the substantial institutional variation across a variety of countries, highlighting research done with modern research designs and recently available administrative datasets. We then estimate a canonical empirical model of individual-level coverage effects and selection in harmonized cross-country data across 18 advanced economies (in Europe and North America). We estimate collective bargaining coverage premia, compression, selection, and spillover coefficients in each country, and use these to document considerable heterogeneity in collective bargaining coverage effects on the wage structure. While there is a strong negative relationship between collective bargaining coverage and wage inequality across countries, substantial uncertainties remain about the underlying mechanisms. Coverage effects may operate through direct premia, selection, or spillovers onto non-covered wages, but distinguishing and quantifying these channels and how they vary across institutional contexts remains a key challenge for future research. In our data, we find that the direct effect of coverage on wages of covered workers does not explain much of the cross-country correlation between coverage and inequality. While compelling research designs often result from specific institutional variation, we also emphasize that these contextual details must be accounted for when comparing estimates across industrial relations systems. A particularly pressing need is for more compelling causal evidence on spillover effects, which could help reconcile conflicting micro and macro evidence on how collective bargaining shapes the wage distribution.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore how socio-economic background shapes academia, collecting the largest dataset of U.S. academics’ backgrounds and research output. Individuals from poorer backgrounds have been severely underrepresented for seven decades, especially in humanities and elite universities. Father’s occupation predicts professors’ discipline choice and, thus, the direction of research. While we find no differences in the average number of publications, academics from poorer backgrounds are both more likely to not publish and to have outstanding publication records. Academics from poorer backgrounds introduce more novel scientific concepts, but are less likely to receive recognition, as measured by citations, Nobel Prize nominations, and awards.</content>

    <title>Spatial Linkages and the Uneven Effects of a Commodity Boom</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the uneven effects of a commodity boom, documenting its impact across workers based on their skill and on the region where they live. To this end, we develop a dynamic quantitative model of an economy with many regions connected through interregional trade and migration. Empirically, we focus on the experience of Brazil during the commodity boom of the 2000s and calibrate the model using detailed micro-level data. At the aggregate level, the boom leads to a decline in the skill premium, resulting from a larger increase in the real wages of unskilled than skilled workers. The model indicates that the commodity boom accounts for a quarter of the decline in the skill premium observed during this period, and masks substantial heterogeneity across states and sectors. Finally, using the model to simulate counterfactuals, we show that spatial linkages—interregional migration and interregional trade—play an important role in shaping the impact of the boom. Spatial linkages reduce the decline in the skill premium at the national level, and also reduce the extent of spatial inequality due to the boom.</content>

    <title>From Flat to Fair? The Effects of a Progressive Tax Reform</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates the impact of a progressive tax reform on tax compliance. We leverage a major progressive tax reform in a large Argentine municipality. First, we use a quasi-experimental design to estimate the causal effect of changes in a household's own tax rates on its tax compliance. Second, we utilize a large-scale natural field experiment to examine whether, holding a household's own tax rates constant, tax compliance is influenced by the tax rates of poorer or richer households. We find that reducing taxes for poorer households increases their compliance, while increasing taxes for richer households decreases their compliance. When poor households learn about the tax hike on the rich, this increases their perceived fairness of the tax system and their tax compliance. When rich households learn about the tax cuts for the poor, their perceived fairness increases significantly, but their compliance, if anything, goes down. Leveraging another reform (and another field experiment) that took place a year later, we show that both the quasi-experimental and experimental findings replicate. Our evidence highlights that tax compliance depends not only on a household's own tax rate but also on its perception of the broader tax schedule. Our findings also highlight the gap between stated and revealed preferences for redistribution. Lastly, we conduct a counterfactual analysis to illustrate the implications of our findings for the design of tax policies.</content>

    <title>Equilibrium Conditions for Catch-22 Situations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This is a paper in the ``economists ruin everything'' field. It considers whether Catch-22 situations can persist as an equilibrium phenomenon. Rather than being an arbitrary rule or a set of self-serving beliefs, the focus is on the preferences of Gatekeepers who choose to create such situations in the first place. The base game-theoretic model is of a Catch-22 situation inspired by Heller's famous paradox. We consider a Requester who may be Sane or Insane and a Gatekeeper who must decide whether to grant the Requester's desired outcome or force them into a less desirable one. This is modelled as a game in which the Requester chooses whether to send a request signal before the Gatekeeper decides. We solve for the conditions under which a Catch-22 situation persists as an equilibrium and its efficiency properties. It is demonstrated that Catch-22 situations can arise, but they reflect an efficient response on the part of a Gatekeeper facing asymmetric information. An application to labour markets is also considered</content>

    <title>Revenue-Sharing Teams with Remote Workers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Remote work policies remain controversial because of the perceived opportunity for increased shirking outside of the traditional office; a problem that is potentially exacerbated if employees work in a revenue-sharing team environment. Using a controlled experiment, where individuals are randomized to different work locations (remote or an office-like setting), we examine how remote work impacts effort choices under individual pay schemes and in revenue sharing teams. Treatments vary the number of remote workers on a team. Our results suggest that work location alone does not lead to productivity differences. However, the location of partners does impact an individual’s effort levels in revenue-sharing teams. Non-remote workers reduce effort as the number of remote partners increases, and remote workers increase effort as the number of remote workers increases. These results are driven predominantly by those who are relatively less productive as individuals. Post-experiment incentivized survey evidence points to expectations of partner productivity as a contributing factor.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Machine learning methods in asset pricing are often criticized for their black box nature. We study this issue by predicting corporate bond returns using interpretable machine learning on a high-dimensional bond characteristics dataset. We achieve state-of-the-art performance while maintaining an interpretable model structure, overcoming the accuracy-interpretability trade-off. The estimation uncovers nonlinear relationships and economically meaningful interactions in bond pricing, notably related to term structure and macroeconomic uncertainty. Subsample analysis reveals stronger sensitivities to these effects for small firms and long-maturity bonds. Finally, we demonstrate how interpretable models enhance transparency in portfolio construction by providing ex ante insights into portfolio composition.</content>

    <title>Harmonization...What Else? The Role for International Regulatory Agreements</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the potential role of international agreements on product standards through a stylized model where countries have different regulatory preferences and firms incur fixed costs of regulatory diversity. Overall, our analysis suggests that the common perception of regulatory agreements as playing a key role in promoting harmonization may have been overstated. We show that regulatory harmony can arise even in the absence of an agreement, and that “spontaneous” harmonization may be inefficient, suggesting that the role of regulatory agreements could be to promote regulatory diversity rather than harmonization. Moreover, the role of regulatory cooperation depends in important ways on the pattern of trade: in the presence of intra-industry trade, the potential role of an agreement tends to be more limited, and under some conditions it can only play a coordination role. Finally, through the lens of our model, we examine the “Pop Critique” of regulatory agreements, according to which lobbying by corporate interests may lead to welfare-reducing harmonization. Our analysis lends only limited support to this critique.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While investments in schooling generate large private and external returns, negative peer interactions in school may generate substantial social costs.  Using data from four national sources (Uniform Crime Reports, National Incident-Based Reporting System, National Crime Victimization Survey, National Electronic Injury Surveillance System) and a variety of identification strategies, this study comprehensively explores the effect of in-person schooling on contemporaneous juvenile violence. Using a proxy for in-person schooling generated from anonymized smartphone data and leveraging county-level variation in school calendars — including unique, large, localized changes to in-person instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic — we find that in-person schooling is associated with a 28 percent increase in juvenile violent crime.  A null finding for young adults is consistent with a causal interpretation of this result.  The effects are largest in larger schools and in jurisdictions with weaker anti-bullying policies, consistent with both concentration effects and a peer quality channel. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that relative to closed K-12 schools, in-person schooling generates $233 million in monthly violent crime costs.</content>

    <title>Coverage, Counter-cyclicality and Targeting of Work Requirement Waivers in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Non-disabled, working age adults without children are required to work 20 hours per week in order to maintain eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. However, states may waive the work requirement for areas that meet conditions reflective of a weak labor market. We construct a dataset with the waiver status of each United States county for every month from 1997–2023 and evaluate waiver coverage, counter-cyclicality and targeting. Waiver coverage has grown over time and in December 2023, when the national unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, waivers covered 29 percent of the U.S. population. In terms of counter-cyclicality, a county’s probability of receiving a waiver increases by 3.1 percentage points for every one percentage point increase in its unemployment rate. In terms of targeting, counties with an unemployment rate below 5 percent received 25 percent of waivers in the average month from 1997–2023. We simulate the effects on waiver eligibility of counterfactual regulations finalized in 2019—but never implemented—by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Altogether, the 2019 rule would have decreased waiver eligibility in all months, increased the responsiveness of waivers to county unemployment rates, and increased the share of waivers targeted to high unemployment counties.</content>

    <title>From Crisis to Norm: Remote Work Trends and Employee Engagement Across Industries, Occupations, and Geography</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use a survey of nearly 360,000 workers conducted from May 2020 through December 2023 to characterize shifts in remote work across time, industry, occupation, and geography, and examine the evolving relationship between remote work and employee engagement. We find remarkable stability in the incidence of remote work since mid-2021 with roughly one-half of workers reporting always working remotely or in a hybrid arrangement. While remote work arrangements across industries remain broad-based, at the occupation level, they are conspicuously concentrated in certain job classifications. Remote work continues to evolve across the U.S., with 13 (14) states experiencing reported increases (decreases) in remote work rates since 2022 with the most populous states experiencing remote working rates exceeding 40% of workers. Empirical evidence shows that while working remotely correlates with higher job satisfaction and lower intentions to quit, these correlations disappear when other workplace characteristics such as pay practices, human resources policies, and managerial relationships are considered. If remote work remains the norm, our results suggest it may not directly influence employee engagement—the workplace still matters.</content>

    <title>The Contribution of Foreign Master's Students to US Start-Ups</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we estimate the effect of increasing the share of foreign-born Master graduates on the creation of innovative start-ups in the US. We combine information on international students graduating from Master's programs by university cohort with data on start-ups created in the US between 1999 and 2020 by graduates of those cohorts.  To establish a causal link, we use idiosyncratic variation in out-of-state relative to in-state fees charged by universities across Master's cohorts, resulting in differential foreign students' enrollment. We also use changes in the share of foreign students predicted by a shift-share instrument, based on university-level past networks, as an additional identification strategy. For each additional ten percentage points of foreign students graduating in a Master's cohort, we find 0.4 additional start-ups in that cohort. Then, using a name-based attribution of the origin of creators of start-ups, we find that between 30 and 45% of the total start-up creation effect is attributable to a positive spillover of foreign-born on start-up founders of US origin.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A common tactic to estimate willingness-to-travel exploits variation in the relative proximity of consumers to supplier locations. The validity of these estimates relies on the exogeneity of that consumer-supplier distance. We argue that distance to suppliers is endogenous because suppliers strategically choose locations to target consumers; we introduce a novel instrument to address this form of endogeneity. Using geolocation data from millions of smartphones, we estimate consumer preferences for specific retail chains across income groups and regions. We show that accounting for distance endogeneity significantly alters willingness-to-travel measures. Contrary to the prevailing “retail apocalypse” narrative, we find that consumer surplus per trip to general merchandise stores did not significantly decline from 2010 to 2019. For the lowest-income consumers, the expansion of national chains, particularly dollar stores, nearly compensates for the closure of traditional department stores and regional chains. Notably, failing to account for distance endogeneity leads to the erroneous conclusion that lower-income households experienced statistically significant consumer surplus declines.</content>

    <title>Aggregate Debt Servicing and the Limit on Private Credit</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper reviews the debt service ratio (DSR) as a theoretically well-grounded indicator of systemic risk. The DSR has the desirable feature that it fluctuates around a stable level which makes its early warning signals easy to understand and communicate.  In contrast, current early warning indicators (EWIs) based on credit-developments lack clear economic interpretations and require statistical detrending, which can reduce their accuracy and usefulness for macroprudential policymakers. The review of the literature shows that the DSR provides highly accurate early warning signals for crises and future economic slowdowns, outperforming traditional credit-based indicators. By extending the measurement of the DSR back to the 1920s – a novel contribution in this paper – we demonstrate its EWI effectiveness across different historical periods and show that the DSR acts as an upper limit on benign financial deepening. The paper also outlines questions for future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Great Depression is the canonical case of a widespread currency war, with more than 70 countries devaluing their currencies relative to gold between 1929 and 1936. What were the currency war’s effects on trade flows? We use newly-compiled, high-frequency bilateral trade data and gravity models that account for when and whether trade partners had devalued to identify the effects of the currency war on global trade. Our empirical estimates show that a country’s trade was reduced by more than 21% following devaluation. This negative and statistically significant decline in trade suggests that the currency war destroyed the trade-enhancing benefits of the global monetary standard, ending regime coordination and increasing trade costs.</content>

    <title>Linear Estimation of Global Average Treatment Effects</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the problem of estimating the average causal effect of treating every member of a population, as opposed to none, using an experiment that treats only some. We consider settings where spillovers have global support and decay slowly with (a generalized notion of) distance. We derive the minimax rate over both estimators and designs, and show that it increases with the spatial rate of spillover decay. Estimators based on OLS regressions like those used to analyze recent large-scale experiments are consistent (though only after de-weighting), achieve the minimax rate when the DGP is linear, and converge faster than IPW-based alternatives when treatment clusters are small, providing one justification for OLS's ubiquity. When the DGP is nonlinear they remain consistent but converge slowly. We further address inference and bandwidth selection. Applied to the cash transfer experiment studied by Egger et al (2022) these methods yield a 20% larger estimated effect on consumption.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Hegemonic powers, like the United States and China, exert influence on other countries by threatening the suspension or alteration of financial and trade relationships. Mechanisms that generate gains from integration, such as external economies of scale and specialization, also increase the hegemon’s power because in equilibrium they make other relationships poor substitutes for those with a global hegemon. Other countries can implement economic security policies to shape their economies in order to insulate themselves from undue foreign pressure. Countries considering these policies face a tradeoff between gains from trade and economic security. While an individual country can make itself better off, uncoordinated attempts by multiple countries to limit their dependency on the hegemon via economic security policies lead to inefficient fragmentation of the global financial and trade system. We study financial services as a leading application both as tools of coercion and an industry with strong strategic complementarities. We estimate that U.S. geoeconomic power relies on financial services, while Chinese power relies on manufacturing. Since power is nonlinear and increases disproportionally as the hegemon approaches controlling the entire supply of a sectoral input, we estimate that much economic security could be achieved with little overall fragmentation by diversifying the input sources of key sectors currently controlled by the hegemons.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a framework to estimate bank franchise value. Contrary to existing models, sticky deposits and low deposit rate betas do not imply negative duration. While operating costs could generate negative duration, they are offset by fixed interest rate spreads from lending activity. Consequently, franchise value declines as interest rates rise, further exacerbating losses on banks’ securities holdings. Banks with less responsive deposit rates tend to invest more in long-term securities, aiming to hedge cash flows rather than market value. Despite significant recent rate hike losses, most U.S. banks still retain sufficient franchise value to remain solvent, justifying forbearance.</content>

    <title>Employee Ownership, Employment, and Work-from-Home in the Covid-19 Shock to the US Job Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To what extent, if at all, did employee-owned (EO) firms maintain jobs for workers compared to non-EO firms in the spring 2020 Covid-19 shock to the US economy? Did EO firms shift jobs from workplaces to work-from-home locations in the pandemic more or less than other firms? This paper uses a unique survey of nearly 750 firms that differ in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) mode of employee ownership to answer these questions. The analysis finds that in the Covid crisis ESOPs with majority ownership of their firm maintained proportionately more jobs and shifted work to workers’ homes more than other firms and that these differences scale with the ESOP percentage of firm ownership. The findings are consistent with a model of firm decision-making in which ESOP firms weigh the well-being of employee-owners as workers in the firm in a job crisis while non-ESOP firms view workers solely as a costly input in production in maximizing the income of their (non-employee) owners.</content>

    <title>Empowered by Adversity: Economic Shocks and Noncognitive Skill Development in Ethiopian Youth</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the widespread economic shocks faced by children in developing countries, the factors that contribute to resilience remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present three novel facts on the development of noncognitive skills using a longitudinal dataset from Ethiopia. First, we observe a weak correlation between parental wealth and noncognitive skills. Second, we find that while adverse weather shock cause a slight decline in cognitive test scores, they boost noncognitive skills, including generalized self-efficacy, self-esteem, and internal locus of control. Lastly, we show that past exposure to adverse weather shocks is correlated with better mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We rationalize these surprising findings within a model of cognitive and noncognitive skill development, where child agency serves a key role. In this model, when a child chooses to exert effort during a particular period, they not only increase their immediate consumption, but it also enhances their noncognitive skills through “learning by doing.” Incorporation of child agency in human capital development result in model predictions that are consistent with the empirical results, and highlights the policy relevance of improving child agency.</content>

    <title>The Uncharted Waters of International Trade</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The field of international trade has undergone significant theoretical and empirical advancements over the last twenty-five years. A key breakthrough has been the emergence of firm-level approaches to studying exporting, importing, and global value chains. The field has also experienced a quantitative revolution, driven by medium-scale models that rapidly assess the implications of trade cost shocks on real income. Additionally, a branch of the empirical literature has unshackled itself from the discipline of theoretical frameworks and from traditional data sources. Yet, several underexplored areas, or `uncharted waters,' remain in international trade research. I outline new potential areas for theoretical research, including incorporating oligopolistic (strategic) behavior into core models, and fostering greater cross-disciplinary collaboration with other fields in economics and social sciences, such as behavioral economics or political science. I also discuss potential uncharted waters for empirical trade economists, while identifying potential new sources of data and ways in which official trade statistics could be improved. Finally, I explore how big data and artificial intelligence could reshape the design of international trade policy in coming years.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fertility levels have greatly decreased in virtually every nation in the world, but the timing of the decline has differed even among developed countries. In Europe, Asia, and North America, total fertility rates of some nations dipped below the magic replacement figure of 2.1 as early as the 1970s. But in other nations, fertility rates remained substantial until the 1990s but plummeted subsequently. This paper addresses why some countries in Europe and Asia with moderate fertility levels in 1980s, have become the “lowest-low” nations today (total fertility rates of less than 1.3), whereas those that decreased earlier have not. Also addressed is why the crossover point for the two groups of nations was around the 1980s and 1990s. An important factor that distinguishes the two groups is their economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s. Countries with “lowest low” fertility rates today experienced rapid growth in GNP per capita after a long period of stagnation or decline. They were catapulted into modernity, but the beliefs, values, and traditions of their citizens changed more slowly. Thus, swift economic change may lead to both generational and gendered conflicts that result in a rapid decrease in the total fertility rate.</content>

    <title>Time Consistent Infrastructure Investments: Optimal Flood Protection Policies in Spatial Equilibrium</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Place-based investments can have unintended general equilibrium effects and face challenges of time inconsistency. This paper simulates the granular impact of alternative spatial and temporal designs of such investments, using Quantitative Spatial Models where the strategy of the policymaker is endogenized, with time-consistent policy analysis or policies with commitment. It can apply to sunk, fixed costs investments in transportation infrastructure, levees, and other location-based investments. Applying this framework to the 1936 Flood Control Act, the largest investment in flood control infrastructure in US history protecting 5% of land, the study examines the general equilibrium effects of levee investments on housing prices, population density, and racial demographics over eight decades. Protected neighborhoods initially had lower property values, higher minority shares, and greater flood risk, but experienced sustained property appreciation and changes in population density. Structural analysis reveals that optimal levee designs prioritize high-density areas, reduce price capitalization, and minimize urban sprawl. Policymakers who cannot commit to long-term plans tend to overbuild and maintain larger systems compared to those with time-consistent strategies.</content>

    <title>New Keynesian Economics through the Extensive Margin</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper reformulates the New Keynesian model to incorporate output adjustments through the extensive margin. Shifting from adjustments through the intensive to the extensive employment margin, the model introduces predetermined output, altering key properties of the New Keynesian framework. First, the Taylor principle is inverted: stability is achieved when nominal rates respond less than one-for-one with inflation. Second, the model significantly alters the output responses to changes in monetary policy. We argue that this represents a challenge and an opportunity for the literature. Sticky information allows the model to correct the sign of impulse responses.</content>

    <title>Intergenerational Mobility over Two Centuries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides an overview of recent empirical and methodological advances in the study of historical intergenerational mobility trends, with a focus on key measurement challenges. These advances are made possible by the recent digitization of historical censuses and new methods of historical record-linking, which have enabled researchers to create large historical samples of parent-child links. We identify three main findings. First, absolute mobility increased in the decades leading up to 1940 but has since declined, both in the US and other industrial countries. Second, recent studies on relative mobility question the classic narrative that the US has transitioned from a “land of opportunity” in the 19th century to a less mobile society today, suggesting that mobility was not as high in the past. However, estimates of relative mobility are sensitive to choices regarding sample selection and measurement. Third, we explore mechanisms underlying shifts in intergenerational mobility over time, including geographic mobility, wealth shocks, educational attainment, locational effects, and the transmission of parent-specific human capital. We conclude by suggesting avenues for future research.</content>

    <title>Immigrant Age at Arrival and the Intergenerational Transmission of Ethnic Identification among Mexican Americans</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many U.S.-born descendants of Mexican immigrants do not identify as Mexican or Hispanic in response to the Hispanic origin question asked in the Census and other government surveys.  Analyzing microdata from the 2000 U.S. Census and the 2001-2019 American Community Surveys, we show that the age at arrival of Mexican immigrants exerts an important influence on ethnic identification not only for these immigrants but also for their U.S.-born children.  Among Mexican immigrants who arrived as children, the rate of “ethnic attrition”—i.e., not self-identifying as Mexican or Hispanic—is higher for those who migrated at a younger age.  Moreover, the children of these immigrants exhibit a similar pattern:  greater ethnic attrition among children whose parents moved to the United States at a younger age.  We unpack the relative importance of several key mechanisms—parental English proficiency, parental education, family structure, intermarriage, and geographic location—through which the age at arrival of immigrant parents influences the ethnic identification of their children.  Intermarriage turns out to be the primary mechanism:  Mexican immigrants who arrived at a very young age are more likely to marry non-Hispanics, and the rate of ethnic attrition is dramatically higher among children with mixed ethnic backgrounds.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Children with a disability are 3.5 times more likely to be maltreated. Federal Early Intervention (EI) serves 426,000 children 0-3 with a disability, 3.7% of the entire population under three. EI’s objective is to support families in caring for their children’s special needs. Compared to children evaluated but ineligible for EI, children receiving EI in the first year of life are 3.3 percentage points less likely to be maltreated later in life, a decline of 45%, with smaller effects for those receiving services later. Targeting at-risk children, intervening early, and engaging with families in a cooperative manner effectively reduces future maltreatment.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this study, we investigate whether reproductive rights affect migration. We do so using a synthetic difference-in-differences design that leverages variation from the 2022 Dobbs decision, which allowed states to ban abortion, and population flows based on change-of-address data from the United States Postal Service. The results indicate that abortion bans cause significant increases in net migration outflows, with effect sizes growing throughout the year after the decision. The most recent data point indicates that total abortion bans come at the cost of more than 36,000 residents per quarter. The effects are more prominent for single-person households than for family households, which may reflect larger effects on younger adults. We also find suggestive evidence of impacts for states that were hostile towards abortion in ways other than having total bans.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Just and efficient allocations of charity have attracted much academic and media attention. The sources of inefficiency and unjust are important to understand yet understudied. Our study aims to fill this void by directly modelling the victims’ market in a collective reputation framework. By analyzing three types of individuals who signal their victim status with different personalities and incentives, we derive the honest, dishonest and unfunded equilibria as well as the mixed equilibrium where both types of these equilibria could coexist. Our analyses of the social welfare under each equilibrium shed light on key parameters that could potentially serve as policy instruments for improving social welfare. We also reveal that the mechanisms analogous to bank run and lemons market could take place in the victims’ market as much as in other markets. In particular, when charity resources are scarce, more strategic signallers could rush to emit false victim signals and drive the market to the dishonest equilibrium with lower social welfare. The need for screening signallers could drive up the psychological costs of authentic victims to the extent that they voluntarily drop out of the market and suffer alone, resulting in misplaced charity funds and severe deadweight losses. When there is psychological utility associated with cheating for the hedonic signallers, the social welfare is even worse off.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) use among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning (LGBQ) teenagers is over 30 percent higher than among their heterosexual counterparts. Yet little is known about how recent efforts to curb nicotine vaping through ENDS taxes impact sexual minorities. This study explores this question using data from the 2015-2021 State Youth Behavior Surveys. We find that a one-dollar (in 2021$) per mL of e-liquid increase in ENDS taxes reduces the likelihood of any prior-month ENDS use among heterosexual teens by about four percentage points and the likelihood of habitual vaping (as measured by frequent and everyday use) by about two percentage points. In sharp contrast, we find no evidence that ENDS taxes reduce any of the vaping measures for queer youths. The coefficient estimates are consistently less strongly negative for LGBQ than heterosexual youths, and the differences in effects on frequent and everyday vaping are statistically significant. Therefore, taxes widen disparities in vaping between queer and straight teens. The estimated effect of ENDS taxes on LGBQ teens who do not report being depressed, suicidal, or bullied is similar to the effect among heterosexuals, suggesting that LGBQ youths’ tax insensitivity may be explained by their dependence on e-cigarettes to cope with unique stress-related psychological challenges.</content>

    <title>Technological Disruption in the Labor Market</title>
    <updated>2025-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>David J. Deming, Christopher Ong &amp; Lawrence H. Summers</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores past episodes of technological disruption in the US labor market, with the goal of learning lessons about the likely future impact of artificial intelligence (AI). We measure changes in the structure of the US labor market going back over a century. We find, perhaps surprisingly, that the pace of change has slowed over time. The years spanning 1990 to 2017 were less disruptive than any prior period we measure, going back to 1880. This comparative decline is not because the job market is stable today but rather because past changes were so profound. General-purpose technologies (GPTs) like steam power and electricity dramatically disrupted the twentieth-century labor market, but the changes took place over decades. We argue that AI could be a GPT on the scale of prior disruptive innovations, which means it is likely too early to assess its full impacts. Nonetheless, we present four indications that the pace of labor market change has accelerated recently, possibly due to technological change. First, the labor market is no longer polarizing— employment in low- and middle-paid occupations has declined, while highly paid employment has grown. Second, employment growth has stalled in low-paid service jobs. Third, the share of employment in STEM jobs has increased by more than 50 percent since 2010, fueled by growth in software and computer-related occupations. Fourth, retail sales employment has declined by 25 percent in the last decade, likely because of technological improvements in online retail. The post-pandemic labor market is changing very rapidly, and a key question is whether this faster pace of change will persist into the future.</content>

    <title>Fisher-Schultz Lecture: Linear Estimation of Structural and Causal Effects for Nonseparable Panel Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops linear estimators for structural and causal parameters in nonparametric,nonseparable models using panel data. These models incorporate unobserved, time-varying, individual heterogeneity, which may be correlated with the regressors. Estimation is based on an approximation of the nonseparable model by a linear sieve specification with individual specific parameters. Effects of interest are estimated by a bias corrected average of individual ridge regressions. We demonstrate how this approach can be applied to estimate causal effects, counterfactual consumer welfare, and averages of individual taxable income elasticities. We show that the proposed estimator has an empirical Bayes interpretation and possesses a number of other useful properties. We formulate Large-T asymptotics that can accommodate discrete regressors and which bypass partial identification in this case. We employ the methods to estimate average equivalent variation and deadweight loss for potential price increases using data on grocery purchases.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are key to economic development, and CEOs are key to firm productivity. Are firms in countries at varying stages of development led by the right CEOs, and if not, why? We develop a parsimonious measure of CEO time use that allows us to differentiate CEOs into “leaders” and “managers” in a survey of 4,800 manufacturing firms across 42 countries, with income per capita ranging from USD 4,000 to 45,000. We find that poorer countries have fewer leaders and relate this to training opportunities. Even when suitable leaders are available, they often do not lead the firms that would benefit the most, resulting in mismatches that can cause up to a 20% loss in productivity for the mismatched firms. The findings imply that policies that address the causes of mismatch could significantly enhance growth without additional resources.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Community-based targeting, in which communities allocate social assistance using local information about who is poor, in experimental settings leads to nuanced allocations that reflect local concepts of poverty. What happens when it is scaled up, by either by making the stakes high, or by replicating the process nationwide? We study this by examining community targeting in both a high-stakes experiment, in which villages determined who would receive the Indonesian conditional cash transfer program – worth almost USD 1,000 over 6 years – and in a nationwide scaleup, whereby Indonesia used community-based meetings to allocate COVID-transfers to over 8 million households. We find that both the experimental scale-up and the massive national scale-up had broadly similar performance to the original experimental study. We find strongly progressive targeting as measured by baseline household consumption, though – as in the pilot – not quite as strong as if they had used a fully up-to-date proxy means test. In both scale-ups, we also find that the villages gave additional weight to locally-valued characteristics beyond pure consumption, such as widowhood, recent illness, and food expenditure shares, again echoing the findings from pilots. The results suggest that community targeting can perform well at scale, as predicted by the experimental study.</content>

    <title>Corporate Resiliency and the Choice Between Financial and Operational Hedging</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate how firms manage financial default risk (on debt) and operational default risk (on delivery obligations). Financially constrained firms reduce operational hedging through inventory and supply chain in favor of cash holdings. Our model predicts that firms’ markup increases with financial default risk as they cut operational hedging costs. Empirical analysis confirms this prediction and shows that the markup-credit risk relationship strengthens during adverse aggregate shocks, particularly for firms exposed to lending disruptions. Market power alone cannot explain this relationship, which reflects firms’ strategic adjustments in operational hedging practices.</content>

    <title>The Comovement of Voter Preferences: Insights from U.S. Presidential Election Prediction Markets Beyond Polls</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a novel time-series econometric framework to forecast U.S. Presidential election outcomes in real time by combining polling data, economic fundamentals, and political prediction market prices. Our model estimates the joint dynamics of voter preferences across states. Applying our approach to the 2024 Presidential Election, we find a two-factor structure driving the vast majority of the variation in voter preferences. We identify electorally similar state clusters without relying on historical data or demographic models of voter behavior. Our simulations quantify the correlations between state-level election outcomes. Failing to take the correlations into account can bias the forecasted win probability for a given candidate by more than 10 percentage points. We find Pennsylvania to be the most pivotal state in the 2024 election. Our results provide insights for election observers, candidates, and traders.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Early childhood in developing countries faces a greater prevalence of risk factors and limited resources, underscoring the need for effective, scalable support models. We develop and experimentally evaluate a multi-component approach to enhance family well-being over-the-phone. The program combines scalable outreaches including calls by a teleoperator, messages, a chatbot, and an AI tool. Targeted at highly vulnerable families with children aged 0 to 3 in Uruguay, the intervention promotes positive parenting practices at home, fosters language development, and provides personalized assistance to help families access government benefits. The intervention was implemented with 1,360 families eligible for support from the government agency Uruguay Crece Contigo over an eight-month period. We find that the program increases weekly frequency of parental engagement in stimulating activities and reduces parental stress. Treated families gain enhanced access to social benefits, including cash transfers and employment support programs.</content>

    <title>Distance to Degrees: How College Proximity Shapes Students’ Enrollment Choices and Attainment Across Race-Ethnicity and Socioeconomic Status</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leveraging rich data on the universe of Texas high school graduates, we estimate how the relationship between geographic access to public two- and four-year postsecondary institutions and postsecondary outcomes varies across race-ethnicity and socioeconomic status. We find that students are sensitive to the distance they must travel to access public colleges and universities, but there are heterogeneous effects across students – particularly with regard to distance to public two-year colleges (i.e., community colleges). White, Asian, and higher-income students who live in a community college desert (i.e., at least 30 minutes driving time from the nearest public two-year college) substitute towards four-year colleges and are more likely to complete bachelor’s degrees. Meanwhile, Black, Hispanic, and lower-income students respond to living in a community college desert by forgoing college enrollment altogether, reducing the likelihood that they earn associate’s and reducing the likelihood that they ultimately transfer to four-year colleges and earn bachelor’s degrees. These relationships persist up to eight years following high school graduation, resulting in substantial long-term gaps in overall degree attainment by race-ethnicity and income in areas with limited postsecondary access.</content>

    <title>Limited Risk Transfer Between Investors: A New Benchmark for Macro-Finance Models</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We define risk transfer as the percent change in the market risk exposure for a group of investors over a given period. We estimate risk transfer using novel data on U.S. investors' portfolio holdings, flows, and returns at the security level with comprehensive coverage across asset classes and broad coverage across the wealth distribution (including 400 billionaires). Our key finding is that risk transfer is small with a mean absolute value of 0.65% per quarter. Leading macro-finance models with heterogeneous investors predict risk transfer that exceeds our estimate by a factor greater than ten because investors react too much to the time-varying equity premium. Thus, the small risk transfer is a new moment to evaluate macro-finance models. We develop a model with inelastic demand, calibrated to the standard asset pricing moments on realized and expected stock returns, that explains the observed risk transfer. The model is adaptable to other macro-finance applications with heterogeneous households.</content>

    <title>Strategic Commitments to Decarbonize: The Role of Large Firms, Common Ownership, and Governments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how government policies and corporate commitments to decarbonize interact under two externalities: environmental damages and green innovation spillovers. Unconstrained carbon taxes and innovation subsidies could achieve first-best outcomes, but when government policies face constraints, commitments by large firms and institutional investors can serve as profit-driven coordination devices that spur green innovation and technology adoption, and thereby reduce overall transition costs. Firm commitments also enhance government policy credibility by lowering the need for high future carbon taxes. Our empirical evidence confirms that firm size and green common ownership drive Net Zero commitments and decarbonization investments.</content>

    <title>Are Big Cities Important for Economic Growth?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cities are often described as engines of economic growth. We assess this statement quantitatively. We focus on two mechanisms: a static agglomeration effect that makes production in bigger cities more efficient, and a dynamic effect whereby urban scale impacts the productivity of invention, which in turn determines the speed of technological progress for the country as a whole. Using estimates of these effects from the literature and MSA-level patent and population data since 1900, we ask how much lower US output would be in 2010 if city size had been limited to one million or one hundred thousand starting in 1900. These effects are small. If city sizes had been limited to one million people since 1900, output in 2010 would have been only 8% lower than its observed value.</content>

    <title>The Hidden Health Care Crisis Behind Bars: A Randomized Trial to Accredit U.S. Jails</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The U.S. has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world, with over seven million admissions to jails each year. Incarcerated individuals are the only group in the U.S. that have a constitutional right to receiving "reasonably adequate" health care. Yet, there is little oversight and funding for health care in jails, where illness and mortality are rampant. In this study, we randomize the offer of health care accreditation to 44 jails across the U.S. Surveys of staff indicate that accreditation improves coordination between health and custody staff. We also find that accreditation improves quality standards and reduces mortality among the incarcerated, which is three times higher among control facilities than official estimates suggest. These health gains are realized alongside suggestive reductions in six-month recidivism, such that accreditation is highly cost effective.</content>

    <title>Ambiguity and the Language of Long Run Risk</title>
    <updated>2025-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates a duality between ambiguity averse preferences and the valuation of long run risky assets or public projects. The variational ambiguity model represents preferences over ambiguous acts via a minimization problem, and is fundamentally nonprobabilistic. In contrast, long run risky assets are ranked via a large maturity limit of expected discounted returns. Despite their apparent differences, we show that each variational ambiguity preference is a long run risk preference, and (under natural conditions) vice versa. We explore three implications: a notion of long run stochastic dominance that resolves differences between stochastic processes considered identical by standard risk measures, a typology of stochastic processes that pinpoints when a non-probabilistic description of long run risk is required, and an evolutionary foundation for variational ambiguity preferences that offers a novel explanation for ambiguity aversion.</content>

    <title>Externalities and the Taxation of Top Earners</title>
    <updated>2025-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Henrik Kleven</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper characterizes the optimal taxation of top earners in a world with externalities. It takes a reduced-form approach that spans a broad class of models where top earners create externalities on the economy. The model allows for a flexible relationship between top earnings and the distribution of earnings capacities in the population, including positive externalities (such as innovation) and negative externalities (such as rent-extraction). The model allows for simple optimal tax formulas that clarify the role of different externality patterns. In general, externalities that run from top earners to bottom earners have much stronger tax implications than externalities within the top group. The results are expressed in terms of estimable sufficient statistics and linked to recent evidence on the externalities of top entrepreneurs. A calibration to the US economy suggests that the optimal top tax rate, while lower than the Mirrleesian optimum, remains higher than the current top tax rate.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We report on the wellbeing of the young in 31 Ex-Soviet Republics located in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.  We find no evidence of the decline in the mental health of the young relative to older people which characterizes Western Europe and English-speaking advanced economies. The mental health of the young in ex-Soviet republics is stable relative to older people across various surveys including the Gallup World Poll, the Eurobarometers, the World Values Surveys and the European Social Survey, as well as in surveys from the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development and UNICEF.  However, there are two exceptions.  A 2023 Flash Eurobarometer Mental Health survey conducted by the European Commission shows unhappiness declines in age in every EU member country including 11 in Eastern Europe.  A similar finding emerges in our analysis of the web-based Global Minds surveys of 2020-2024 in 9 former Soviet republics.  Youngster ages 18-24 in these surveys are especially unhappy.  Furthermore, in keeping with research on children aged 15-16 in the PISA surveys in other countries, we find life satisfaction of these school children in ex-Soviet Republics declined over the period 2015-2022 and that, among this group, time spent on digital devices was associated with lower happiness.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Is the top tail of wealth a set of fixed individuals or is there substantial turnover? We estimate upper-tail wealth dynamics during the Gilded Age and beyond, a time of rapid wealth accumulation and concentration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Using various wealth proxies and data tracking tens of millions of individuals, we find that most extremely wealthy individuals drop out of the top tail within their lifetimes. Yet, elite wealth still matters. We find a non-linear association between grandparental wealth and being in the top 1%, such that having a rich grandparent exponentially increases the likelihood of reaching the top 1%. Still, over 90% of the grandchildren of top 1% wealth grandfathers did not achieve that level.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines technology sophistication in establishments. To comprehensively measure technology sophistication, we create a grid that covers key business functions and the technologies used to conduct them. Analyzing data from over 21,000 establishments in 15 countries, we find that the most widely used technology is usually not the most sophisticated available in the business function. There is significant variation in technology sophistication across and within countries, explaining 31% of productivity dispersion and over half of the agricultural productivity gap. The sophistication of widely used technologies is more relevant for productivity than the most advanced technologies. More sophisticated technologies are appropriate for both developed and developing countries.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Positive assortative matching refers to the tendency of individuals with similar characteristics to form partnerships. Measuring the extent to which assortative matching differs between two economies is challenging when the marginal distributions of the characteristic along which sorting takes place (e.g., education) change for either or both sexes. We show how the use of different measures can generate different conclusions. We provide axiomatic characterization for measures such as the odds ratio, normalized trace, and likelihood ratio, and provide a structural economic interpretation of the odds ratio. We then use our approach to consider how marital sorting by education changed between the 1950s and the 1970s cohort, for which both educational attainment and returns in the labor market changed substantially.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Great powers are increasingly using their economic and financial strength for geopolitical aims.  This rise of "geoeconomics" has the potential to reshape the international trade and financial system. This paper examines the role of domestic political economy forces in determining a government's ability to project geoeconomic power abroad. We also discuss the role that persuading or coercing foreign governments plays in projecting geoeconomic power around the world.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Protecting species’ habitats is the main policy tool employed across the globe to reduce biodiversity losses. These protections are hypothesized to conflict with private landowners’ interests. We study the economic consequences of the most extensive and controversial piece of such environmental legislation in US history—the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973. We assemble the most comprehensive data on species conservation efforts, land transactions, and building permits to date. By comparing parcels with identical histories of protections we show that, on average, the ESA shifts transactions from inside to outside of the protected area and leads to a slight appreciation in residential and vacant land values outside of critical habitats. We also show that the federal regulator determines borders for areas with the most stringent protections to avoid large effects on land values, only where it is explicitly allowed to take economic criteria into account. These average findings mask significant heterogeneity at the species and location level, which we document. Furthermore, we find no evidence of the ESA affecting building activity as measured by construction permits. Overall, even taking into account species-level heterogeneity, the number of possibly negatively affected parcels is extremely small. This suggests that the capitalization of the economic impacts of the ESA through the land market channel are likely minor, despite potential delays to development through permitting, for which we provide suggestive evidence. Our findings do not rule out economically significant impacts in a few highly constrained land markets with ESA protections amplified by local regulatory action.</content>

    <title>Prediction with Differential Covariate Classification: Illustrated by Racial/Ethnic Classification in Medical Risk Assessment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A common practice in evidence-based decision-making uses estimates of conditional probabilities P(y|x) obtained from research studies to predict outcomes y on the basis of observed covariates x. Given this information, decisions are then based on the predicted outcomes. Researchers commonly assume that the predictors used in the generation of the evidence are the same as those used in applying the evidence: i.e., the meaning of x in the two circumstances is the same. This may not be the case in real-world settings. Across a wide-range of settings, ranging from clinical practice to education policy, demographic attributes (e.g., age, race, ethnicity) are often classified differently in research studies than in decision settings. This paper studies identification in such settings. We propose a formal framework for prediction with what we term differential covariate classification (DCC). Using this framework, we analyze partial identification of probabilistic predictions and assess how various assumptions influence the identification regions. We apply the findings to a range of settings, focusing mainly on differential classification of individuals' race and ethnicity in clinical medicine. We find that bounds on P(y|x) can be wide, and the information needed to narrow them available only in special cases. These findings highlight an important problem in using evidence in decision making, a problem that has not yet been fully appreciated in debates on classification in public policy and medicine.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Platform intermediation of goods and services has considerably transformed the U.S. economy. We use administrative data on U.S. tax returns to study the role of the gig economy on entrepreneurship. We find that gig workers are more likely to become entrepreneurs, particularly those who are lower income, younger, and benefit from flexibility. We track all newly created firms and show that gig workers start firms in similar industries as their gig experience, which are less likely to survive and demonstrate higher performance. Overall, our findings suggest on-the-job learning promotes entrepreneurial entry and shifts the types of firms started by entrepreneurs.</content>

    <title>Daughters as Safety Net? Family Responses to Parental Employment Shocks: Evidence from Alcohol Prohibition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impact of Federal alcohol Prohibition in 1919 on workers in the alcohol industry and their families using newly linked census records that allow us to follow spouses, sons and daughters.  Immediately after Prohibition, men previously working in alcohol-related industries were less likely to be in the labor force, and when working, employed in lower skilled occupations. By 1940, 21 years after Prohibition, workers were still more likely to be in unskilled occupations, but they were more likely to be employed, consistent with delayed retirement. In the short run, sons are largely unaffected but in the long run, they complete slightly more schooling and earn more. Interestingly, daughters were more likely to remain at home, delay marriage and be employed, even 20 years later. These effects are driven by daughters living at home in 1920. Daughters, not sons, appear to have acted as the family's safety net in this period before public provision of relief.</content>

    <title>Large Language Models: An Applied Econometric Framework</title>
    <updated>2025-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How can we use the novel capacities of large language models (LLMs) in empirical research? And how can we do so while accounting for their limitations, which are themselves only poorly understood? We develop an econometric framework to answer this question that distinguishes between two types of empirical tasks. Using LLMs for prediction problems (including hypothesis generation) is valid under one condition: no “leakage” between the LLM’s training dataset and the researcher’s sample. No leakage can be ensured by using open-source LLMs with documented training data and published weights. Using LLM outputs for estimation problems to automate the measurement of some economic concept (expressed either by some text or from human subjects) requires the researcher to collect at least some validation data: without such data, the errors of the LLM’s automation cannot be assessed and accounted for. As long as these steps are taken, LLM outputs can be used in empirical research with the familiar econometric guarantees we desire. Using two illustrative applications to finance and political economy, we find that these requirements are stringent; when they are violated, the limitations of LLMs now result in unreliable empirical estimates. Our results suggest the excitement around the empirical uses of LLMs is warranted – they allow researchers to effectively use even small amounts of language data for both prediction and estimation – but only with these safeguards in place.</content>

    <title>The Economy, the Ghost in Your Gene, and the Escape from Premature Mortality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Explanations for the West's escape from premature mortality have focused on chronic malnutrition or income and on public health or state capacity.  We argue that by ignoring the multigenerational effects of variance in ancestors' harvests, we are underestimating the contribution of modern economic growth to the escape from early death at older ages. Using a newly constructed multigenerational dataset for Sweden, we show that grandsons' longevity was strongly linked to spatial shocks  in paternal grandfathers' yearly harvest variability when agricultural productivity  was low and market integration was limited.  We reason that an epigenetic  mechanism is the most plausible explanation for our findings.  We posit that  the removal of trade barriers, improvements in transportation, and agricultural  innovation reduced harvest variability. We contend that for older Swedish men  (but not women) born 1830-1909 this reduction was as important as decreasing  contemporaneous infectious disease rates and more important than eliminating  exposure to poor harvests in-utero.</content>

    <title>Charging Uncertainty: Real-Time Charging Data and Electric Vehicle Adoption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Charging infrastructure is critical to electric vehicle (EV) adoption, but for chargers to be most useful, EV drivers need to know in real time where they are and whether they are working and available. We investigate the availability of real-time data from DC fast chargers on six major US Interstates and model the impacts of expanding access to real-time data to all DC fast chargers near highways. On average, between March and August 2024, 32.9% of DC fast charging stations adjacent to those six Interstates provided their real-time status on PlugShare, a major charge-finding app, with gaps of up to 1,308 miles without real-time data. Further, we survey potential car buyers and EV owners and find low credibility of currently-available real-time data. We incorporate this data into a two-sided model of consumer vehicle choice and charging station build-out adapted from Cole et al. (2023). If universal real-time data is accompanied by improved charger uptime and driver confidence in the accuracy of the real-time data, we predict that the EV share of new vehicle sales would grow by 8.0 percentage points in 2030, expanding the EV fleet by 13.2%, and reducing 2030 carbon emissions by 22.5 mmt, versus baseline projections for 2030.</content>

    <title>Accounting for Individual-Specific Heterogeneity in Intergenerational Income Mobility</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a fully nonparametric model to investigate the dynamics of intergenerational income mobility for discrete outcomes. In our model, an individual’s income class probabilities depend on parental income in a manner that accommodates nonlinearities and interactions among various individual and parental characteristics, including race, education, and parental age at childbearing. Consequently, we offer a generalization of Markov chain mobility models. We employ kernel techniques from machine learning and further regularization for estimating this highly flexible model. Utilizing data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), we find that race and parental education interact with parental income in children’s economic prospects in ways that can create bottlenecks in mobility.</content>

    <title>The Effects of Digital Surveillance and Managerial Clarity on Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How managers frame the adoption of organizational practices may impact the returns to such practices, but managerial justification is often correlated with the use of particular practices or other dimensions of managerial quality. Using a randomized control trial, we study how the causal impacts of a frequently used monitoring management practice for remote work employers–digital worker surveillance–varies by randomly allocated justification for its use. In an online labor market, we divide workers into low and high-productivity performers, and randomize both whether surveillance is used and whether its use is justified based on the workers’ baseline productivity. We find that digital surveillance does not have significant effects on worker performance on average, but that not explaining the presence or elimination of digital surveillance based on worker performance significantly reduces worker output. Our results demonstrate a nuanced relationship between monitoring and worker performance that depends on how monitoring is rationalized to workers.</content>

    <title>Does Q&amp;A Boost Engagement? Health Messaging Experiments in the U.S. and Ghana</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Effective information sharing is critical for the success of organizations and governments. Because information that is easy to access is more likely to be adopted, leaders often minimize friction in information delivery. However, one type of friction may increase engagement: piquing curiosity by posing relevant questions prior to sharing information. To test this, we shared identical information about COVID-19 in either question-and-answer format or via direct statements across two preregistered field experiments in Ghana and Michigan (total N=49,395). Q&amp;A-style communication increased information seeking about directly related topics (e.g., how to wear a mask properly) by 1.0 percentage-point (216%) in Ghana and by 1.1 percentage-points (19%) in Michigan (p’s&lt;0.001), and increased self-reported behavior change by 1.3 percentage-points (4%) in Michigan (p=0.002). However, sharing information in Q&amp;A format did not increase interest in general COVID-19 information in either setting, suggesting that the impact of Q&amp;A-style messaging on information seeking may be issue-specific. In Michigan, both Q&amp;A-style and direct statement messaging produced less information-seeking than sending no informational messages, likely due to differential attrition: the more texts participants received, the more likely they were to opt out of receiving messages, which made it impossible for them to seek more information via text. In a follow-up implementation experiment with social media ads (a messaging strategy without attrition challenges) Q&amp;A-style ads generated 9-11% more unique clicks to the CDC website per dollar spent than ads that directly stated information about vaccines (p&lt;0.001). We speculate that Q&amp;A-style information delivery may stimulate curiosity, driving its benefits.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the aftermath of the 1997-98 Asian crises, many emerging markets self-insured by accumulating international reserves (i.e., non-contingent assets) in excess of what many models predicted, while relying relatively little on state-contingent assets. This apparent over-reliance on self-insurance has been viewed as a puzzle in search of an explanation. A related, and still outstanding, puzzle is why the benefits of financial liberalization appear to be quite small and, yet, financial globalization has been unprecedented in recent decades. We show that these two puzzles can be solved by incorporating rare macroeconomic disasters in income risk. To this effect, we first fit a fat-tailed distribution to long output time series for 156 countries. We then develop a theoretical framework to quantify (i) the increase in welfare gains of financial integration and (ii) how the composition of official reserves (non-contingent and contingent) responds to bigger shocks. Our results show that fat tails lead to a sharp increase in both the gains of financial integration and self-insurance for standard values of the coefficient of risk aversion.</content>

    <title>A Different World: Enduring Effects of School Desegregation on Ideology and Attitudes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In 1975, a federal court ordered the desegregation of public schools in Jefferson County, KY. In order to approximately equalize the share of minorities across schools, students were assigned to a busing schedule that depended on the first letter of their last name. We use the resulting quasi-random variation to estimate the long-run impact of attending an inner-city school on political participation and preferences among whites. Drawing on administrative voter registration records and an original survey, we find that being bused to an inner-city school significantly increases support for the Democratic Party and its candidates more than forty years later. Consistent with the idea that exposure to an inner-city environment causes a permanent change in ideological outlook, we also find evidence that bused individuals are much less likely to believe in a "just world" (i.e., that success is earned rather than attributable to luck) and, more tentatively, that they become more supportive of some forms of redistribution. Taken together, our findings point to a poverty-centered version of the contact hypothesis, whereby witnessing economic deprivation durably sensitizes individuals to issues of inequality and fairness.</content>

    <title>Does Unilateral Decarbonization Pay For Itself?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper shows that unilateral decarbonization pays for itself in large economies. We estimate economic damages from global temperature shocks and combine them with a climate-economy model to construct Domestic Costs of Carbon: $226 per ton for the United States and $216 per ton for the European Union. When compared to marginal abatement costs, these values imply over 80% unilateral decarbonization for both economies, an order of magnitude larger than under conventional damages estimated based on local temperature.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper describes a process for automatically generating academic finance papers using large language models (LLMs). It demonstrates the process’ efficacy by producing hundreds of complete papers on stock return predictability, a topic particularly well-suited for our illustration. We first mine over 30,000 potential stock return predictor signals from accounting data, and apply the Novy-Marx and Velikov (2024) “Assaying Anomalies” protocol to generate standardized “template reports” for 96 signals that pass the protocol’s rigorous criteria. Each report details a signal’s performance predicting stock returns using a wide array of tests and benchmarks it to more than 200 other known anomalies. Finally, we use state-of-the-art LLMs to generate three distinct complete versions of academic papers for each signal. The different versions include creative names for the signals, contain custom introductions providing different theoretical justifications for the observed predictability patterns, and incorporate citations to existing (and, on occasion, imagined) literature supporting their respective claims. This experiment illustrates AI’s potential for enhancing financial research efficiency, but also serves as a cautionary tale, illustrating how it can be abused to industrialize HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the economic effects of the interaction of nature loss and climate change in a model that incorporates important aspects of both processes. We capture the distinct ways in which they affect economic activity—with nature constituting a key factor of production and climate change destroying parts of output—but also the ways in which they interact: climate change causes nature loss, and nature provides both a carbon sink and adaptation tools to reduce climate damages. Our analysis of these feedback loops reveals a novel amplification channel—the Twin-Crises Multiplier—that systematically affects optimal climate and nature conservation policies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using Measure 114’s narrow passage in Oregon as a natural experiment, we study how new gun regulations affect firearm demand. Background checks, a proxy for demand, rose 13.9% in anticipation of the referendum and surged 157% immediately following the election. After judicial intervention halted the law’s enactment, demand returned near pre-election levels. Temporal displacement/harvesting does not explain the demand spike: after eighteen months, we still observe a substantial cumulative increase of 63,000 excess firearm-related background checks. Administrative data reveal significant county-level heterogeneity. This evidence underscores the paradoxical effect of gun-control policies, offering a cautionary lesson to policymakers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use administrative records on the healthcare utilization and economic outcomes of the universe of Danish households to characterize survivors' mental health following their spouse's death. We provide visually clear evidence for the inevitable immediate, large, and lingering adverse impacts and focus on studying the role of potential mediators: economic conditions and the presence of children. We find no evidence of heterogeneity in family composition. As for economic outcomes, baseline levels of income and net wealth play only a modest role: there is no meaningful cross-household inequality gradient in mental health declines, so that spousal death is devastating for both the rich and the poor. Rather, a key source of heterogeneity in the decline in mental health is the household's degree of income insurance, that is, the within-household income variation. Specifically, the least-insured households experience an immediate decline in mental health that is 80 percent larger. Our findings suggest that the consumption smoothing welfare gains from income protection policies can have important spillovers to improved mental health in the context of severe household events.</content>

After a church opening, same-ethnicity residents of chosen neighborhoods experienced falling earnings but strengthened communal ties, as compared to residents of areas matched on baseline characteristics. Treated residents held more manual occupations, and increased in-group marriage and naming. These effects persist into the second generation and are not observed for non-ethnic neighbors. Consistent with the historical record, Poles organized communal life around neighborhood parishes, but Italians were less church-centered.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The core statistical technology in artificial intelligence is the large-scale transformer network. We propose a new asset pricing model that implants a transformer in the stochastic discount factor. This structure leverages conditional pricing information via cross-asset information sharing and nonlinearity. We also develop a linear transformer that serves as a simplified surrogate from which we derive an intuitive decomposition of the transformer's asset pricing mechanisms. We find large reductions in pricing errors from our artificial intelligence pricing model (AIPM) relative to previous machine learning models and dissect the sources of these gains.</content>

    <title>The Growth Dividend and Excess Interest</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Standard deficit accounting neglects the growth dividend: the amount by which annual GDP growth shrinks the debt-GDP ratio. America's growth dividend has more than doubled since the Great Recession because the debt ratio has more than doubled, leading to headline deficits that far exceed changes in the debt ratio. Each year's change in the debt ratio can be decomposed into three components: the primary deficit (non-interest spending minus tax revenue), interest payments, and the growth dividend. The sum of the latter two is excess interest: the impact of past debt on the debt ratio, roughly equal to last year's debt ratio times the excess interest rate (r-g)/(1+g) where r is the average nominal interest rate on federal debt and g is the nominal GDP growth rate. Excess interest remains slightly negative in CBO's baseline ten-year projection. Hence, current debt is sustainable in the CBO baseline despite high interest payments, and primary deficits entirely drive the unsustainable projected debt ratio path and provide a good guide for how the debt ratio is projected to change. However, America's higher debt ratio implies higher vulnerability to the risk that the excess interest rate turns persistently positive.</content>

    <title>Robust Fiscal Stabilization</title>
    <updated>2025-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Any fiscal path is sustainable if future fiscal policy responds sufficiently to high deficits. Previous work found that Congress reduced the deficit during 1984-2003 when projected deficits rose. We find that this year-to-year feedback has disappeared: Congress on average during 2004-2024 did not respond to the projected deficit. We quantify how strong fiscal feedback needs to be going forward in order to keep the debt-GDP ratio below 250% in one hundred years, taking as given the debt sensitivity of interest rates implicit in official projections. Without fiscal risk, the government can succeed either by modestly and gradually reducing the deficit or by suddenly and permanently reducing the deficit once this century by 1.5% of GDP. When considering large transitory deficit shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic and persistent interest rate shocks, keeping the debt ratio below 250% with 95% probability requires stronger gradual feedback — 0.5%-1.1% of GDP average deficit reduction in the next decade — though less strong than actually observed during 1984-2003. Successful sudden feedback requires being able to undertake 1.5%-of-GDP deficit reductions twice in thirteen-year periods, suggesting that a “wait-and-see” approach to successful deficit reduction sometimes allows little waiting.</content>

    <title>American Life Histories</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What does it take to live a meaningful life? We exploit a unique corpus of over 1,400 life narratives of older Americans collected by a team of writers during the 1930s. We combine detailed human readings with large language models (LLMs) to extract systematic information on critical junctures, sources of meaning, and overall life satisfaction. Under specific conditions, LLMs can provide responses to complex questions that are indistinguishable from those of human readers, effectively passing a version of the Turing Test. We find that sources of life meaning are more varied than previous research suggested, underlining the importance of work and community contributions in addition to family and close relationships (emphasized by earlier work). The narratives also highlight gendered disparities, with women disproportionately citing adverse family events, such as the loss of a parent, underscoring their role as keepers of the kin. Our research expands our understanding of human flourishing during a transformative period in American history and establishes a robust and scalable framework for exploring subjective well-being across diverse historical and cultural contexts.</content>

    <title>Racial Inequality in the Labor Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this chapter, we introduce a new framework for studying the evolution of racial inequality in the labor market. The framework encompasses two broad forces – distributional and positional – that affect labor market gaps by racial and ethnic identity over time. We provide long-run results on the evolution of Black-White earnings gaps, including new results for Black and White women, and we review the evidence on historical factors affecting racial gaps. We then provide new results on racial gaps among other groups in the U.S. and discuss the evidence on racial gaps outside the U.S. We then discuss the role of prejudice-based discrimination in driving racial gaps, particularly in the post-civil-rights era, a period when such discrimination has been thought to play a declining role in racial inequality. We describe forces that can amplify existing discrimination, such as monopsony and workers’ perceptions of prejudice in the economy, and we discuss recent literature directly measuring discrimination through expanded audit studies and quasi-experimental variation. We conclude with a discussion of existing and new frontiers on race in the labor market, including stratification, reformulations of prejudice, and understanding the way race has shaped purportedly race-neutral institutions throughout the economy.</content>

    <title>Welfare Effects of Buyer and Seller Power</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we provide a theoretical characterization of the welfare effects of buyer and seller power in vertical relations and introduce an empirical approach for quantifying the contributions of each channel to deadweight loss. Our model accommodates both monopsony distortions from buyer power and double-marginalization distortions from seller power. Rather than imposing a specific form of vertical conduct, we allow it to arise endogenously based on model primitives. We show that the relative elasticity of upstream supply and downstream demand is the key determinant of whether buyer or seller power creates distortions. Applying our framework to coal procurement by power plants in Texas, we find that 83% of the distortion comes from the monopoly power of coal mines, with the remainder attributed to the monopsony power of power plants.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter examines the multifaceted interactions between top digital platforms and technology ventures across capital, labor, innovation, and product markets. Exploring how venture investments, talent flows, strategic alliances, and competitive behaviors can shape the innovation ecosystem, the chapter highlights both the complementary and competitive dynamics between large incumbents and smaller entrants, and the benefits and potential inefficiencies that may arise from them, as demonstrated by the empirical and theoretical literatures. Throughout, the chapter identifies key areas for research that can support a rigorous evaluation of policy proposals concerning evolving market structures in the digital economy.</content>

    <title>Mean Reversion in Randomized Controlled Trials: Implications for Program Targeting and Heterogeneous Treatment Effects</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Eligibility criteria for interventions can induce an Ashenfelter Dip, and subsequent mean-reversion may result in improvement over time even absent the intervention. We investigate these dynamics for a food-as-medicine program to treat diabetes, where eligibility required elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Both treatment and control groups experienced significant improvements in HbA1c, resulting in an estimated null effect. When we predict improvement using baseline characteristics, we find that subjects unlikely to improve on their own appear to benefit from the program. Our findings have implications for program targeting and estimating heterogeneous treatment effects.</content>

    <title>Modernizing Access to Credit for Younger Entrepreneurs: From FICO to Cash Flow</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Younger entrepreneurs are disadvantaged by traditional loan underwriting, which relies heavily on personal credit scores. With data from three fintech companies, we show that incorporating timely information about ability to repay from business checking account statements particularly improves default prediction performance for younger business owners. We develop a novel method to compare model predictions across subgroups—Tail Analysis for Comparative Outcomes (TACO)—which finds that switching from a Baseline (FICO-driven) model to a Cash Flow-enhanced model benefits younger entrepreneurs. We confirm this in causal analysis of approval decisions, showing that access to cash flow-intensive underwriting increases approval rates for younger vs. older entrepreneurs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Individuals trade present for future consumption across a range of economic behaviors, and this tradeoff may differ across socioeconomic groups. To assess these tradeoffs, we estimate a dynamic model of residential solar adoption and system sizing in California using household-level data on solar irradiance, electricity consumption, and electricity rates that offer plausibly exogenous variation in the future benefits from adopting relative to upfront costs. We find implicit discount rates of 15.3%, 13.8%, and 10.0% for low-, medium-, and high-wealth households. Counterfactual simulations demonstrate opportunities to reduce the regressivity of solar adoption, increase policy cost-effectiveness, and improve welfare for low-wealth households.</content>

    <title>What is the general Welfare? Welfare Economic Perspectives</title>
    <updated>2025-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Researchers cannot definitively interpret what the framers of the United States Constitution had in mind when they wrote of the general Welfare. Nevertheless, welfare economics can contribute to policy choice in democracies. Specifying social welfare functions enables coherent analysis, by formalizing mechanisms for preference aggregation and studying the policies they yield. This paper argues that it is essential for welfare economics to adequately express the richness and variety of actual human preferences over social states. I first discuss devices that economists have used in attempts to circumvent or grossly simplify specification of social welfare functions. I next discuss the common welfare economic practice of assuming that personal preferences are homogeneous, consequentialist, and self-centered. I then call for incorporation of broader forms of personal preferences into social welfare functions. Individuals may hold heterogeneous social preferences, being concerned in various ways with the distribution of outcomes in the population. They may hold heterogeneous deontological preferences, placing value on their own actions and the actions of others. They may have preferences for the mechanism used to aggregate preferences in a social welfare function. These potential aspects of personal preference should be recognized in welfare economics.</content>
