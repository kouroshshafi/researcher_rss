    <title>The Origins and Evolution of Occupational Licensing in the United States</title>
    <updated>2025-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The analysis of occupational licensing has concentrated largely on its labor market and consumer welfare effects. By contrast, relatively little is known about how occupational licensing laws originated or the key factors in their evolution. In this paper, we study the determinants of U.S. licensing requirements from 1870 to 2020. We begin by developing a model where licensing arises as an endogenous political outcome and use this framework to study how market characteristics and political incentives influence regulators’ choices. Our empirical analysis draws on a novel database tracking the initial enactment of licensing legislation for hundreds of unique occupations, as well as changes to the specific qualifications required to obtain a subset of licenses over time. We first show that, consistent with the predictions of our model, licensing requirements are more common and were adopted earlier for occupations whose tasks plausibly pose some risk to consumers. Second, large, urbanized states are significantly more likely to produce new policies. Third, among occupations regulated before 1940, licensing requirements appeared earlier in states with more practitioners and where incumbent workers likely experienced greater labor market competition. After 1980, state-level factors are more strongly associated with the timing of policy adoption. Finally, political organization, as measured by the establishment of a state professional association, significantly increases the probability of regulation. Together, our findings suggest that both public and private interests have contributed to the diffusion of licensing requirements across states and occupations.</content>

    <title>Why Are Nordic Workers so Remote?: Potential Causes and (Some) Indirect Labor Market Consequences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article, we show that working from home is much more prevalent in the Nordic countries than in the rest of Europe and we discuss potential causes and labor market consequences of this stylized fact. Likely contributing causes include a good technological infrastructure and comparatively widespread digital preparedness in the population.  Recent research also suggests that trust is a crucial prerequisite for maintaining a spatial separation between supervisors and workers in marginal occupations. We show that survey measures of trust are extremely high in all Nordic countries, and that these measures correlate very strongly with work-from-home across countries and industries in Europe even controlling for a range of cross-country differences. Finally, we discuss potential spillover effects of increased hybrid work on the Nordic labor markets. We show evidence suggesting that increased hybrid work has caused a relocation of the production of local service firms from business centers to high-work-from-home residential areas, without affecting average commuting distances of service workers.</content>

    <title>Should Friday be the New Saturday? Hours Worked and Hours Wanted</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates self-reported wedges between how much people work and how much they want to work, at their current wage. More than two-thirds of full-time workers in German survey data are overworked—actual hours exceed desired hours. We combine this evidence with a simple model of labor supply to assess the welfare consequences of tighter weekly hours limits via willingness-to-pay calculations. According to counterfactuals, the optimal length of the workweek in Germany is 37 hours. Introducing such a cap would raise welfare by .8-1.6% of GDP. The gains from a shortened workweek are largest for workers who are married, female, white collar, middle aged, and high income. An extended analysis integrates a non-constant wage-hours relationship, falling capital returns, and a shrinking tax base.</content>

    <title>Expert Patients’ Use of Avoidable Health Care</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We measure whether expert patients – those trained as physicians and nurses – have fewer emergency department visits and the reasons for these differences. Relative to similar patients physicians and nurses had 19.8% and 5.1% fewer ED visits, principally due to fewer avoidable visits. The differences in avoidable visits between physicians and other patients were largest for diagnoses commonly requiring prescriptions, which physicians often self-prescribed. Our results suggest that improving access to prescriptions for acute symptoms, more than improving patient education, may reduce avoidable health care.</content>

    <title>Expropriation Without Compensation: Copper in Chile, 1970-1973</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this essay, I analyze the nationalization of large copper mines during Salvador Allende’s socialist government in Chile in the 1970s. This is one of the earliest cases “nationalization without compensation.” Chile’s legal argument was based on the novel idea that “adequate” payment should be calculated as book value minus “excessive profits.” In turn, excessive profits were defined, for every year, as profits above 12% of book value. I analyze the economic arguments that led to nationalization, and I deconstruct and critically evaluate the methodology used to calculate “excessive profits” and “adequate compensation.” I analyze the US and multinationals’ response to Chile’s nationalization policies.</content>

    <title>A Test of the Efficiency of a Given Portfolio in High Dimensions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We generalize the seminal Gibbons-Ross-Shanken test to the empirically relevant case where the number of test assets far exceeds the number of observations. In such a setting, one needs to use a regularized estimator of the covariance matrix of test assets, which leads to biases in the original test statistic. Random Matrix Theory allows us to account for these biases and to evaluate the test’s power. Power increases with the number of test assets and reaches the maximum for a broad range of local alternatives. These conclusions are supported by an extensive simulation study. We implement the test empirically for state-of-the-art candidate efficient portfolios and test assets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We draw on a recombinant view of innovation, where being in a new location and/or multiple locations leads to exposure to novel combinations of ideas that increase the creativity of top scientists. Using a rich, unique dataset we helped assemble, we estimate the empirical relationship between being in a new location and/or multiple locations and the expected interval before an eventual Nobel laureate (ENL) commences their prize-winning work.  We find that being in a new location and in multiple locations are substantially and significantly associated with a shorter expected interval before ENLs commence their prize-winning work.</content>

    <title>Racial Disparities and Bias in Consumer Bankruptcy</title>
    <updated>2025-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Bronson Argyle, Sasha Indarte, Benjamin Iverson &amp; Christopher Palmer</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document substantial racial disparities in consumer bankruptcy outcomes and investigate the role of racial bias in contributing to these disparities. Using data on the near universe of US bankruptcy cases and self-reported and manually-identified measures of race, we show that minority filers are unconditionally 12.7 and 2.3 percentage points more likely to have their bankruptcy cases dismissed without debt relief in Chapters 13 and 7, respectively. We uncover strong evidence of racial homophily: in Chapter 13, where trustees have more discretion, minority filers are 2.3 percentage points more likely to be dismissed when randomly assigned to a White bankruptcy trustee than to a minority trustee. Black and Hispanic Chapter 13 filers are the most negatively affected by homophily. To interpret our findings, we develop a general decision model and new identification results relating homophily to bias. Our homophily approach is particularly useful in settings where traditional outcome tests for bias are not feasible because the decision-maker's objective is not well defined or decision-relevant outcomes or risk factors are unobserved. Applying this framework to our homophily estimate implies that at least 15% of the unconditional Chapter 13 dismissal gap and 53% of the conditional dismissal gap for minority filers is due to either taste-based or inaccurate statistical discrimination.</content>

    <title>The Optimal Monetary Policy Response to Tariffs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What is the optimal monetary policy response to tariffs? This paper explores this question within an open-economy New Keynesian model and shows that the optimal monetary policy response is expansionary, with inflation rising above and beyond the direct effects of tariffs. This result holds regardless of whether tariffs apply to consumption goods or intermediate inputs, whether the shock is temporary or permanent, and whether tariffs address other distortions.</content>

    <title>The Road Not Taken: How Driving Distance and Appointment Availability Shape the Effects of Abortion Bans</title>
    <updated>2025-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use difference-in-differences research designs to estimate the effects of abortion bans on births at the county level, leveraging data on changes in driving distance and appointment availability at the nearest facility where abortion remains legal. We find that bans alone increase births, but their total impact depends on geographic barriers to access. Even in counties where distance and appointment availability remain unchanged, a total ban leads to a 1.0% increase in births, suggesting a chilling effect—potentially due to legal uncertainty, misinformation, or logistical hurdles—that is independent of measurable barriers. However, the effects grow substantially with travel burdens. In counties where the nearest abortion facility was 50 miles away pre-Dobbs, a total ban increases births by 2.8% when distance rises to 300 miles. Limited appointment availability in destination cities further amplifies these effects, resulting in an additional 0.4 percentage point increase in births. The largest increases occur among Black and Hispanic women, those without a college degree, and unmarried women. We do not observe evidence that the effects have diminished with time despite expanded logistical, financial, and telehealth abortion support, underscoring the persistent role that geographic barriers play in abortion access.</content>

    <title>From Access to Wellness: Early Life Exposure to Abortion Legalization and the Next Generation’s Health</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the multigenerational impacts of legalized abortion in the United States by analyzing how early-life exposure to this policy shift affects birth outcomes in the next generation. Using event study and two-way fixed effects models, we link maternal early-life exposure to legal abortion with improved birth outcomes in the subsequent generation, including higher birth weights and reduced rates of low birth weight. Our analysis of the mechanisms shows that these improvements in birth outcomes are not driven by changes in maternal racial or age composition within the treated generation. Instead, enhanced educational attainment and increased prenatal care utilization among the treated generation appear to play a critical role. Our results highlight the far-reaching implications of reproductive health policies, especially relevant in the post-Dobbs era, where access may once again become constrained for many.</content>

    <title>The Effects of Competition in the Retail Gasoline Industry</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the effect of competition on incumbent firm pricing by using high frequency price data and the precise geographic location for all gas stations in California. Using an event study design, we find that the entry of a new station is associated with a 2.5 cent decrease in prices at incumbent stores, which equates to a 7% reduction in estimated retail markups. The effects are immediate, persistent, and show no sign of deterrence or limit pricing behavior. In contrast, nearby exit results in precisely estimated null effects on prices with no evidence of predatory pricing in the lead up to the station departure. The results are consistent across all fuel blends and dissipate with station distance. Finally, we explore the asymmetric effects, showing that the difference cannot be attributed to difference in branding, proximity to highway, or data quality idiosyncrasies, although we find suggestive evidence that exit tends to happen in more competitive markets and amongst less heavily trafficked stations.</content>

    <title>Standardized Test Scores and Academic Performance at Ivy-Plus Colleges</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze admissions and transcript records for students at multiple Ivy-Plus colleges to study the relationship between standardized (SAT/ACT) test scores, high school GPA, and first-year college grades. Standardized test scores predict academic outcomes with a normalized slope four times greater than that from high school GPA, all conditional on students’ race, gender, and socioeconomic status. Standardized test scores also exhibit no calibration bias, as they do not underpredict college performance for students from less advantaged backgrounds. Collectively these results suggest that standardized test scores provide important information to measure applicants’ academic preparation that is not available elsewhere in the application file.</content>

    <title>Recovering Credible Trade Elasticities from Incredible Trade Reforms</title>
    <updated>2025-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how trade-policy dynamics affect the dynamics of trade volumes and the implications of these effects for estimates of the trade elasticity. We use data on US imports and trade policy from 1974–2017 for China and Vietnam—the countries with the largest import growth and the largest tariff reductions over the last fifty years—and a heterogeneous-firm dynamic trade model to recover the dynamic path of the trade elasticity following an unanticipated, permanent tariff change. We estimate a short-run trade elasticity of about three and a long-run trade elasticity of about 14, and find that it takes about five years to close half of the gap between the current and long-run levels of trade. We argue that the expected dynamics of future trade policy before and after these reforms biases down reduced-form estimates of the long-run trade elasticity and biases up estimates of the short-run elasticity. We argue that these measurement issues are even more problematic for other trade reforms, especially those within the Normal Trade Relations (NTR) regime that constitute the majority of the data.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper surveys the literature that links macroeconomics and climate change. We organize our review into three categories: (i) loss and damage, which assesses long-run economic costs and non-market impacts from climate change; (ii) mitigation and the energy transition, which evaluates the macroeconomic consequences of shifting away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy; and (iii) adaptation, which explores the economic adjustments necessary to manage heat stress, more frequent severe weather events and rising seas. We discuss macroeconomic frameworks that quantify these structural shifts as well as empirical estimates that guide their calibration. We suggest areas in which macroeconomic research on climate is needed.</content>

    <title>A Quest for AI Knowledge</title>
    <updated>2025-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Joshua S. Gans</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative and large language models capable of interpolating precisely between known data points, reshapes scientists' incentives for pursuing novel versus incremental research. Extending the theoretical framework of Carnehl and Schneider (2025), we analyse how decision-makers leverage AI to improve precision within well-defined knowledge domains. We identify conditions under which the availability of AI tools encourages scientists to choose more socially valuable, highly novel research projects, contrasting sharply with traditional patterns of incremental knowledge growth. Our model demonstrates a critical complementarity: scientists strategically align their research novelty choices to maximise the domain where AI can reliably inform decision-making. This dynamic fundamentally transforms the evolution of scientific knowledge, leading either to systematic “stepping stone” expansions or endogenous research cycles of strategic knowledge deepening. We discuss the broader implications for science policy, highlighting how sufficiently capable AI tools could mitigate traditional inefficiencies in scientific innovation, aligning private research incentives closely with the social optimum.</content>

    <title>The Academic Consequences of Affirmative Action Bans Combined with Diversity Targets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the problem of a college affected by both a legal ban on affirmative action in admissions and pressure to raise enrollment of underrepresented minorities (URMs), as exemplified by UCLA, which adopted a holistic admissions process in 2006 in response to protests over low URM enrollment. The new process increased the URM share of admitted students by about 3 percentage points, but the primary effects of the changes were on admissions decisions within racial/ethnic groups. Within all groups, admission rates for applicants with high SAT scores and low income and parental education declined. Measured relative to UCLA’s pre-2006 revealed preferences, achieving the increase in URM admissions via holistic admissions was roughly 4-5 times as costly as doing so via a simple reallocation of slots between groups. Had UCLA complied with a stricter interpretation of the affirmative action ban, it would have been significantly more costly.</content>

    <title>In-kind Government Assistance and Crowd-out of Charitable Services: Evidence from Free School Meals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many community organizations provide services similar to government programs, but there is limited evidence how increased government aid affects the use and availability of charitable services. This study examines how greater access to federal nutrition assistance through schoolwide free meal programs affects food bank use within the U.S.’s largest food bank network. A 10 percent increase in access to free school meals reduces the amount of food that food banks distribute by 0.9-1.4 percent, without significantly reducing donations, fundraising activity, or the amount of food available. The reduction of food bank use is only found in areas where relatively few students previously qualified for government aid. Our findings highlight that even safety net programs that serve a specific population and offer distinct services can reduce pressures on charitable organizations, particularly in areas previously underserved by government assistance.</content>

We first provide a primer on the data sources, including advantages, disadvantages and use cases. Historical data sources include linked census records as well as digitized maps and directories. Contemporary data come from satellites, mobile phones, social media and wikis, posted prices and listings, e-commerce and payment card transactions, newly available administrative sources, and text, among others. We then discuss the advances these data have enabled in substantive areas throughout urban and regional economics, with historical and contemporary examples in each area. We conclude with some predictions and warnings</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use matched employer-employee data to study where Americans live in relation to employer worksites. Mean distance from employee home to employer worksite rose from 15 miles in 2019 to 26 miles in 2023. Twelve percent of employees hired after March 2020 live at least fifty miles from their employers in 2023, triple the pre-pandemic share. Distance from employer rose more for persons in their 30s and 40s, in highly paid employees, and in Finance, Information, and Professional Services. Among persons who stay with the same employer from one year to the next, we find net migration to states with lower top tax rates and areas with cheaper housing. These migration patterns greatly intensify after the pandemic and are much stronger for high earners. Top tax rates fell 5.2 percentage points for high earners who stayed with the same employer but switched states in 2020. Finally, we show that employers treat distant employees as a more flexible margin of adjustment.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study capital regulation in a dynamic model for bank deposits. Capital regulation addresses banks’ incentive for excessive leverage that dilutes depositors, but preserves some dilution to reduce bank defaults. We show theoretically that capital regulation is subject to a time inconsistency problem. In a model with non-maturing deposits where optimal withdrawals make deposits endogenously long-term, we find commitment to have important effects on the optimal level and cyclicality of capital adequacy. Our results call for a systematic framework that limits capital regulators’ discretion.</content>

    <title>Supply Constraints do not Explain House Price and Quantity Growth Across U.S. Cities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The standard view of housing markets holds that the flexibility of local housing supply–shaped by factors like geography and regulation–strongly affects the response of house prices, house quantities and population to rising housing demand. However, from 2000 to 2020, we find that higher income growth predicts the same growth in house prices, housing quantity, and population regardless of a city's estimated housing supply elasticity. We find the same pattern when we expand the sample to 1980 to 2020, use different elasticity measures, and when we instrument for local housing demand. Using a general demand-and-supply framework, we show that our findings imply that constrained housing supply is relatively unimportant in explaining differences in rising house prices among U.S. cities. These results challenge the prevailing view of local housing and labor markets and suggest that easing housing supply constraints may not yield the anticipated improvements in housing affordability.</content>

    <title>Methane Abatement Costs in the Oil and Gas Industry: Survey and Synthesis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is growing recognition of the relative importance of anthropogenic emissions of methane as a contributor to global climate change. An important source of such emissions in some countries, including the United States, is the oil and gas (O&amp;G) sector. This points to the importance of developing understanding of the marginal abatement cost functions for methane emissions reductions. Scholars have employed a diverse set of methodologies to estimate abatement costs, including engineering cost models, econometric analysis of natural gas markets, and statistical retrospective analysis of state-level regulation. We critically summarize these approaches and synthesize their results. We find significant potential for low-cost methane abatement in the O&amp;G sector in the United States and elsewhere, although claims of widespread negative abatement cost opportunities should be taken with a grain of salt. We also find that the potential for low-cost abatement is not without limit. Whereas it appears that cutting methane emissions in half would be relatively inexpensive, a sharp uptick in marginal abatement cost may occur when reductions exceed 60 to 80 percent below baseline levels. This threshold may change over time with technological advances in remote sensing, which can reduce abatement costs at various levels of ambition.</content>

    <title>Strategic Digitization in Currency and Payment Competition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We model the competition between digital forms of fiat money and private digital money (PDM). Countries strategically digitize their fiat money — upgrading existing or launching new payment systems (including CBDCs) — to enhance adoption and counter PDM competition. A pecking order emerges: less dominant currencies digitize earlier, reflecting a first-mover advantage; dominant currencies delay digitization until they face competition; the weakest currencies forgo digitization. Delayed digitization allows PDM to gain dominance, eventually weakening fiat money’s role. We also highlight how geopolitical considerations, stablecoins, and interoperability between fiat and private digital money shape the digitization of money and monetary competition.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the effects of sewer access on neighborhood characteristics in developing world cities. Because it is more difficult to move sewage uphill than downhill, otherwise similar neighborhoods on opposite sides of drainage basin divides may face different costs of sewer access. We exploit this intuition to identify the effect of sewer access by comparing outcomes for neighborhoods on opposite sides of drainage basin divides. We estimate the effect of sewer access on census tract population density, literacy, and income for Brazil, Colombia, South Africa, Jordan, and Tanzania. On average, sewer access has a large effect on population density and almost none on demographics. These estimates imply that sewer networks are often as important for the economic geography of cities as transportation networks.</content>

    <title>Does Fund Size Affect Private Equity Performance? Evidence from Donation Inflows to Private Universities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do returns in private equity (PE) rise or fall with fund scale? This question is increasingly urgent amid larger funds and new focus on the retail market. Since better managers can raise larger funds, the causal effect is difficult to identify. We develop an instrument based on gifts to universities, which lead to more capital for managers with preexisting relationships. We show decreasing returns; for example, a 1% size increase reduces net IRR by 0.1 percentage points. Larger funds do larger deals, which perform worse. We find no change in risk, in part because additional deals are more levered.</content>

    <title>Homeownership and Attention to Inflation: Evidence from Information Treatments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how homeownership status shapes attention to inflation and its impact on durable consumption. Using randomized controlled trials on U.S. households (2021–2023), we document systematic heterogeneity in responses to inflation-related information. Homeowners exhibit greater baseline awareness and update their expectations less than renters. Exploiting exogenous variation in inflation expectations induced by the treatments, we find that homeowners adjust durable spending significantly, whereas renters do not. These results highlight homeownership as a key factor in the formation of inflation expectations and their influence on economic behavior.</content>

    <title>The Economics of Healthcare Fraud</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Healthcare fraud imposes a sizable cost on U.S. public healthcare budgets and distorts health care provision. We examine the economics of health care fraud and enforcement using theory and data and connect to a growing literature on the topic. We first offer a new economic definition of health care fraud that captures and connects the wide range of activities prosecuted as fraud. We define fraud as any divergence between the care an insurer says a patient qualifies for, the care a provider provides, and the care a provider bills for. Our definition clarifies the economic consequences of different categories of fraud and provides a framework for understanding the slate of existing studies. Next, we examine the incentives for committing and for prosecuting fraud. We show how fraud is driven by a combination of inadequate (expected) penalties for fraud and imperfect reimbursement rates. Public anti-fraud litigation is driven by the relative monetary, political or career returns to prosecuting fraud and by prosecutorial budgets. Finally, we examine the prevalence of health care fraud prosecutions across types of fraud and types of care, and across the US, by machine learning on text data from Department of Justice press releases.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leveraging county-level variation in exposure to industry-specific foreign-based robotics shocks, this study is the first to explore the relationship between U.S. robotics expansions and crime. Instrumental variables estimates show that a 10 percent increase in robotics exposure led to a 0.2 to 0.3 percent increase in property crime arrests.  In contrast, we find little evidence of a relationship between robotics expansions and violent crime. Our estimates are consistent with robotics-induced declines in employment and earnings among low-skilled manufacturing workers. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that during the period over which robotics exposure induced adverse employment effects, such exposure generated approximately $322 million (2024$) in additional crime costs nationally.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The prospect for electric vehicles (EVs) as a climate change solution hinges on their widespread adoption across political lines. This paper uses county-level data to show that from 2012-2023, about half of all new EV registrations in the U.S. went to the 10% most Democratic counties. This correlation remains largely stable over time, though EV trucks show a lower correlation than other EV types. We also conducted a survey, finding no difference in the ability of Democrats and Republicans to identify EVs. Overall, our results suggest that barriers to widespread U.S. EV adoption may be greater than anticipated.</content>

    <title>Shadow Always Touches the Feet: Implications of Bank Credit Lines to Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using real estate investment trusts (REITs) that invest in commercial real estate (CRE) as a leading example, we study the implications for banks of extending credit lines to “shadow banks” or non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs). While small and mid-size banks hold an economically significant direct exposure in CRE term loans, a significant part of the CRE exposure of large banks is indirect via credit-line provision to REITs. Utilization of credit lines by REITs tends to be substantially more sensitive to market stress than non-financial corporates and other NBFIs. In turn, large banks suffer drawdowns and equity corrections in stress times from extending credit lines to REITs. Ignoring this NBFI credit line channel understates the exposure of large banks to stress. We propose a methodology to incorporate this exposure and its heterogeneity in bank capital stress tests.</content>

    <title>Correcting Endogeneity via Instrument-Free Two-Stage Nonparametric Copula Control Functions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Given the ubiquitous presence of endogenous regressors and the challenges in finding good instruments to overcome the endogeneity problem, a forefront of recent research is the development and application of endogeneity correction methods without requiring instruments. In this article,  we formulate the regressor endogeneity problem using a novel conditional copula endogeneity model to capture the regressor-error dependence unexplained by exogenous regressors. The model relaxes the key assumption of Gaussian copula regressor-error dependence structure and eliminates unnecessary modeling of  regressors.  Under the model, we develop an instrument-free two-stage nonparametric copula endogeneity control function approach (2sCOPE-np), which generalizes existing copula endogeneity correction methods and minimizes the assumptions in the first-stage auxiliary model for endogenous regressors. Specifically, the 2sCOPE-np employs robust model-free kernel estimates of copula control functions. We elucidate and demonstrate the  robustness and broad applicability of 2sCOPE-np, compared to existing copula endogeneity correction methods.  Simulation studies further demonstrate that 2sCOPE-np outperforms existing methods. We illustrate the usage of 2sCOPE-np in an empirical application of the store sales demand estimation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Liquidity management is key in industries with variable cash flows. We study how businesses in the highway construction industry manage cash flow by strategically bidding more on work with an earlier payout—a practice known as front-end loading. We find that small contractors, infrequent bidders, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises front-end load more intensely, indicating a stronger preference for earlier payment. An equilibrium bidding model highlights a novel pathway through which this preference can affect procurement and its managerial and policy implications.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Defensive hiring of researchers by incumbent firms with monopsony power reduces creative destruction. This mechanism helps explain the simultaneous rise in R&amp;D spending and decline in TFP growth in the US economy over recent decades. We develop a simple model highlighting the critical role of the inelastic supply of research labor in enabling this effect. Empirical evidence confirms that the research labor supply in the US is indeed inelastic and supports other model predictions: incumbent R&amp;D spending is negatively correlated with creative destruction and sectoral TFP growth while extending incumbents' lifespan. All these effects are amplified when ideas are harder to find. An extended version of the model quantifies these mechanisms' implications for productivity, innovation, and policy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study market illiquidity in an economy subject to non-fundamental shocks. Asset trading occurs via decentralized one-on-one bargaining. The model has multiple rational expectations equilibria; we associate certain Pareto inferior equilibria with liquidity crises. The government can improve welfare by acting as a “market-maker of last resort” (MMLR), purchasing assets at above-market prices. Several policies employed by the US during the financial crisis are examples of MMLR. We consider “aggressive” and “conservative” MMLR policies. The aggressive policy supports the unique pareto optimal equilibrium. The conservative policy, which embeds a “no-bailout constraint,” only supports an inefficient equilibrium.</content>

    <title>The Value of Worker Rights in Collective Bargaining</title>
    <updated>2025-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes novel natural language methods to measure worker rights from collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) for use in empirical economic analysis. Applying unsupervised text-as-data algorithms to a new collection of 30,000 CBAs from Canada in the period 1986-2015, we parse legal obligations (e.g., “the employer shall provide...”) and legal rights (e.g., “workers shall receive...”) from the contract text. We validate that contract clauses provide worker rights, which include both amenities and control over the work environment. Companies that provide more worker rights score highly on a survey indicating pro-worker management practices. Using time-varying province-level variation in labor income tax rates, we find that higher taxes increase the share of worker-rights clauses while reducing pre-tax wages in unionized firms, consistent with a substitution effect away from taxed compensation (wages) toward untaxed amenities (worker rights). Further, an exogenous increase in the value of outside options (from a leave-one-out instrument for labor demand) increases the share of worker rights clauses in CBAs. Combining the regression estimates, we infer that a one-standard-deviation increase in worker rights is valued at about 5.7% of wages.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Treasury markets respond to the news in CBO cost estimates of individual bills about the future funding requirements from pending legislation. Treasury yields increase on days with major deficit-increasing bills, driven by an increase in expected inflation and nominal term premia, along with a decrease in convenience yields. The effects are three times larger for cost revisions for emergency spending proposals, which are unfunded and have a high probability of enactment. Our high-frequency estimates imply that a 1 percentage point one-time increase in deficits/GDP increases the 10-year nominal yield by 0.75 bps. This effect is equivalent to a 6.75 bps increase in yields for a persistent shock to deficits. Investors use these cost releases to learn about the U.S. fiscal stance. In a model with learning, we find that investors attributed a significant portion of the deficit news from cost releases to revisions in policy parameters and that 57% of the total deficit impact was expected to be unbacked.</content>

Today, more than one in three Greeks reports a refugee background. While its historical significance is well-documented, its short-, medium-, and long-term impact on human capital accumulation remains unexplored. How did forced displacement shape the educational trajectories of the uprooted and their offspring? Did refugees invest in portable skills to respond to uncertainty, or did they struggle to catch up with the autochthonous? To address these questions, we trace the educational investments of refugees and their descendants over the last 100 years, leveraging granular census data and a comprehensive mapping of both their origins in Anatolia and their settlements in Greece. The analysis provides compelling support for the uprootedness hypothesis. Though initially lagging, refugees settling in the Greek countryside eventually outperformed nearby natives in educational attainment. Their university choices also diverged, with refugees’ lineages favoring degrees transferable beyond the Greek labor market, such as engineering and medicine, and natives specializing in law and other fields with a strong home bias. Exploring additional mechanisms reveals the critical role of linguistic barriers and local economic conditions in shaping these outcomes, rather than the refugees’ pre-migration economic background. The widespread educational gains of refugees and their descendants over four generations offer some hope that the ongoing surge of forced displacement, despite its tragedy, if properly addressed by the international community, can be a backbone of economic resilience for the affected communities.</content>

    <title>Growth and Fluctuations Economies with Land Speculation</title>
    <updated>2025-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper considers growth and fluctuations in a standard Overlapping Generations (OLG) model with rational expectations, with land (a non-produced asset), credit frictions, and endogenous growth. Under plausible conditions, there can be multiple momentary equilibria, with the multiplicity itself depending on capital and land prices; this can give rise in turn to an infinity of rational expectations trajectories, all operating within bounds that can be calculated. Improvements in technology, while in the short run increasing GDP, may result in the equilibrium being unstable and fragile—and in the long run lead to a stagnation trap with lower GDP. The introduction of land increases the scope for fluctuations; the only rational expectations trajectories may entail fluctuations, with episodic unemployment and dynamic inefficiencies. With credit frictions, expansionary credit and financial policies may lead to lower growth, with the additional funds unevenly going to land speculation, diverting savings from productive investments, results consistent with empirical evidence. The analysis resolves several theoretical puzzles, such as how can land prices be finite with an interest rate less than the growth rate. It shows that even with two state variables, a tractable OLG model can be constructed providing a global analysis of complex dynamics.</content>

    <title>The Evolution of Inflation Targeting from the 1990s to the 2020s: Developments and Challenges</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Since the initial launch of inflation targeting in the early 1990s in New Zealand and a few other countries, inflation targeting has become the predominant monetary policy strategy in large advanced and emerging market economies. Inflation targeting has been remarkably successful in anchoring inflation, likely owing to core elements of the framework across central banks. Its reaction process, which adjusts the monetary policy stance to ensure the return of inflation to target, allows it to flexibly incorporate a wide range of factors while limiting the discretionary biases that can contribute to excessive inflation. The emphasis on communications about the inflation outlook promotes transparency and accountability. As a result, inflation targeting central banks have, on balance, managed well the large shocks associated with the Global Financial Crisis and COVID. Even so, there are numerous challenges discussed in this paper that are associated with calibration and communications of forward guidance, quantitative easing/tightening, and financial stability.</content>

    <title>How Much Should We Spend to Reduce A.I.'s Existential Risk?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;During the Covid-19 pandemic, the United States effectively “spent” about 4 percent of GDP — via reduced economic activity — to address a mortality risk of roughly 0.3 percent. Many experts believe that catastrophic risks from advanced A.I. over the next decade are at least this large, suggesting that a comparable mitigation investment could be worthwhile. Existing lives are valued by policymakers at around $10 million each in the United States. To avoid a 1% mortality risk, this value implies a willingness to pay of $100,000 per person — more than 100% of per capita GDP. If the risk is realized over the next two decades, an annual investment of 5% of GDP toward mitigating catastrophic risk could be justified, depending on the effectiveness of such investment. This back-of-the-envelope intuition is supported by the model developed here. In the model, for most of the scenarios and parameter combinations considered, spending at least 1% of GDP annually to mitigate AI risk can be justified even without placing any value on the welfare of future generations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A lot! Profitability subsumes all of “quality” investing, explaining both the performance of the strategies that industry markets and the factors that academics employ. It also has striking power pricing “defensive equity” strategies that overweight low-beta or low-volatility stocks. Profitability tilts explain all the abnormal performance of popular “alternative value” strategies, including those adjusted for “intangibles,” and half of value's post-2007 underperformance. Profitability is crucial for pricing a wide array of seemingly unrelated anomalies, yielding a more parsimonious understanding of the cross section of expected returns.</content>

    <title>The Long Shadow of Early Education: Evidence from a Natural Experiment in the Philippines</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does early educational quality affect longer-term academic outcomes? We shed light on this question via a natural experiment in the Philippines—the implementation of a mother tongue education policy in public schools in kindergarten to Grade 3. This policy led to an unexpected decline in educational quality, but differentially in a subset of schools strongly predicted by pre-policy student language composition. We use language composition variables as instrumental variables for treatment. Leveraging panel data and confirming robustness to pre-trends, we find that the policy led to declines in standardized test scores in public primary schools. Employing a triple-difference strategy with Philippine Census data (across cohorts, localities, and decadal censuses), we show that by 2020, cohorts fully exposed to the policy completed 0.3 fewer years of schooling. By revealing how a policy-induced reduction in early education quality reduces educational attainment in later years, our results underscore the importance of investing in the quality of education in the first years of schooling.</content>

    <title>Beyond Tariffs: How Did China’s State–Owned Enterprises Shape the US–China Trade War?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the role played by Chinese state–owned firms during the US–China trade war. Based on measures constructed from Chinese firm–level customs microdata, we show that the presence of state–owned enterprises (SOEs) in Chinese imports led to a large negative impact on US exports in addition to the effect of tariffs. Abstracting from general equilibrium effects, while tariffs account for an 8% decline in US exports to China, the SOE effect accounts for a 4% decline. This SOE effect was concentrated toward the end of 2018 and start of 2019, point at which a vast majority of products had already been targeted by tariffs. Further, the SOE effect was concentrated among agricultural goods and industrial supplies, as well as among industries located in US regions with a high share of Republican votes. We also find that US exports were rerouted to the rest of the world in response to Chinese tariffs, but not in response to reduced imports by Chinese SOEs.</content>

    <title>Cloze Encounters: The Impact of Pirated Data Access on LLM Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text generation, but their performance may be influenced by the datasets on which they are trained, including potentially unauthorized or pirated content. We investigate the extent to which data access through pirated books influences LLM responses. We test the performance of leading foundation models (GPT, Claude, Llama, and Gemini) on a set of books that were and were not included in the Books3 dataset, which contains full-text pirated books and could be used for LLM training. We assess book-level performance using the “name cloze” word-prediction task. To examine the causal effect of Books3 inclusion we employ an instrumental variables strategy that exploits the pattern of book publication years in the Books3 dataset. In our sample of 12,916 books, we find significant improvements in LLM name cloze accuracy on books available within the Books3 dataset compared to those not present in these data. These effects are more pronounced for less popular books as compared to more popular books and vary across leading models. These findings have crucial implications for the economics of digitization, copyright policy, and the design and training of AI systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;School districts increasingly gauge school quality with surveys that ask about school climate and student engagement. We use data from New York City’s middle and high schools to compare the long-run predictive validity of surveys with that of conventional test score value-added models (VAMs). Our analysis leverages the New York school match, which includes an element of random assignment, to validate a wide range of school quality estimates. We contrast the predictiveness of survey- and test-based measures for school effects on consequential outcomes related to high school graduation and college enrollment. Survey data generate better predictions of school impacts on high school graduation than test scores. But school effects on advanced high school diplomas and college attainment are better predicted by test score VAMs than surveys. We quantify the practical value of test-based and survey-based school quality measures by simulating the effects of access to one or both types of information for parents. Parents interested in boosting their children’s college attainment benefit more from test score value-added than from survey data.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a new methodology to detect and measure economic activity using geospatial data and apply it to steel production, a major industrial pollution source worldwide. Combining plant output data with geospatial data, such as ambient air pollutants, nighttime lights, and temperature, we train machine learning models to predict plant locations and output. We identify about 40% (70%) of plants missing from the training sample within a 1 km (5 km) radius and achieve R² above 0.8 for output prediction at a 1 km grid and at the plant level, as well as for both regional and time series validations. Our approach can be adapted to other industries and regions, and used by policymakers and researchers to track and measure industrial activity in near real time.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter examines the role of spatial sorting in shaping economic inequality in the United States. We first document the evolution of firm and worker sorting by skill level between 1980 and 2017. We highlight a shift since 2000, where both high-education workers and firms increasingly sort away from high-wage, high-rent areas. Throughout the entire time period, high-education workers continue to sort to high amenity areas. We then develop a spatial equilibrium model that incorporates idiosyncratic worker and firm sorting and discuss estimation techniques to identify model parameters. We review recent empirical advancements in spatial sorting, including firm and worker location choices and their interactions with housing policy. We conclude by outlining the model’s limitations and proposing directions for future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a dynamic macroeconomic framework with worker heterogeneity, putty-clay adjustment frictions, and firm monopsony power to study the distributional impact of labor market policies over time. Our framework reconciles the well-known tension between low short-run and high long-run elasticities of substitution across inputs of production, especially among workers with different skills within a same education group. We use this framework to evaluate the effects of redistributive policies such as the minimum wage and the Earned Income Tax Credit. We argue that since these policies generate slow transition dynamics that can differ greatly in the short and long run, a serious assessment of their overall impact must take account of the entire time path of the responses they induce.</content>

    <title>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Measurement of Telework During and Shortly After the Pandemic—an On-the-Ground Perspective</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020, the amount of telework sharply increased, allowing people to work while limiting their exposure to others. At that time, there were no regular monthly economic indicators measuring the prevalence of telework. Thus, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) supplemented its monthly economic indicators to better measure the effect of the pandemic on the labor market, adding a short set of questions to the Current Population Survey (CPS) in May 2020. This set focused on the immediate labor market response to COVID-19, including one question about whether people were teleworking because of the pandemic. These questions became less relevant over time and were replaced in October 2022 by a new set of questions that focused entirely on telework—specifically, telework prior to the onset of the pandemic and current telework practices. The questions about telework prior to the pandemic were discontinued in November 2023, but the questions about current telework were permanently retained.  This paper describes the development, evaluation, collection, analysis, and publication of the two sets of questions. We then compare the results of the telework metrics in the two sets, demonstrating how, although related, they measure fundamentally different concepts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that the long-run economic benefits of a low-cost early-life health intervention transmit to later generations, but only for children of exposed mothers. We provide novel evidence that the program improved mothers' marriage outcomes but had limited effects on fathers' partnering decisions. Changes in assortative mating patterns may, therefore, be an important mechanism behind program-induced intergenerational spillovers. We also show that the intervention significantly increased economic mobility across three generations, suggesting that early health interventions may be important candidates for reducing the cycle of poverty.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Impact investors claim to distinguish themselves from traditional venture capital and growth equity investors by also pursuing ESG objectives. Whether they successfully do so in practice is unclear. We use confidential Census Bureau microdata to assess worker outcomes across portfolio companies. Consistent with earlier studies, impact investors are more likely than other private equity firms to fund businesses in economically disadvantaged areas, and the performance of these companies lags behind those held by traditional private investors. We show that postfunding impact-backed firms are more likely to hire minorities, unskilled workers, and individuals with lower historical earnings, perhaps reflecting the higher representation of minorities in top positions. They also allocate wage increases more favorably to minorities and rank-and-file workers than VC-backed firms. Our results are consistent with impact investors and their portfolio companies acting according to non-pecuniary social goals.</content>

I hope that users as well as consumers will find Sections that broaden their views. I start with when an economist might want to run an experiment. I then discuss basic lessons when designing experiments. I introduce a language to start a systematic description of tools we have when designing experiments to show the importance or role of a new model or force in explaining behavior. The penultimate chapter provides an advanced toolkit for running experiments. I end this chapter with my views on pre-registration, pre-analysis plans and the need for replications, robustness tests and extensions.</content>

    <title>The Role of Risk and Ambiguity Preferences on Early-Childhood Investment: Evidence from Rural India</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Understanding the role of preferences, beliefs, and constraints on social and wealth inequities is a key unlock for economic growth. This study focuses on the inter-relationship between risk and ambiguity preferences of mothers, their early childhood investments, and their children’s outcomes. To do so, we elicit ambiguity attitude and risk aversion preference parameters from more than 6000 randomly sampled mothers from nearly 500 villages in Rajasthan, India. Across several measures of mothers’ investment in nutrition of their children between the ages of 0-6, we find a robust and stable positive correlation of estimated ambiguity attitude and risk aversion parameters with maternal investments: the more risk and ambiguity averse the mother, the greater her investments. Such investments are correlated with better children’s cognitive and non-cognitive skills, as mothers with greater risk and ambiguity aversion have children with superior skills, even after accounting for socio-economic differences. Importantly, the positive effect of ambiguity and risk aversion on early-life outcomes can attenuate the negative impact of proxies of socio-economic disadvantage, such as illiteracy of the mothers, belonging to historically discriminated social groups, no exposure to radio, television, or zero access to mobile phones for all measures of cognitive and non-cognitive early-life skills.</content>

    <title>The Inverted U-Shaped Relationship between Female Entrepreneurship and Economic Development</title>
    <updated>2025-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the World Bank Enterprise Survey, the share of entrepreneurs who are women first rises and then falls with national income, which reverses the well-known U-shaped relationship between female labor force participation and economic development.  This paper presents a model of entrepreneurship in which women face disadvantages, including discrimination from workers and household demands on their time, that deter firm formation in the poorest countries. In richer countries, these forces mean that women are less likely to start more complex organizations.  In the model, women face the most level playing field in middle-income countries, where the returns to entrepreneurship are high enough to offset gender-based costs and both sexes typically form simple forms.  We document three facts that are compatible with the model: male-owned firms are typically much larger than female-owned firms, large firms yield far higher revenues per employee and female-owned firms are more usually in industries with low levels of skilled workers. Despite the entrepreneurship rate’s reversal of the U-shaped link between female labor-force-participation and economic development, female labor-force-participation and the entrepreneurship rate are highly correlated across countries.  The female entrepreneurship rate is also strongly associated with female education, weak kinship ties and Buddhism.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Flood protection infrastructure investments, such as Army Corps of Engineers levees, can enhance resilience to flood risks amplified by climate change. We estimate levees’ benefits by exploiting repeat residential property transactions. In areas protected by levees, home values increase 3-4 percent. Levees impose adverse spillover flood risks that reduce home values in nearby areas by 1-5 percent. Capitalized benefits in protected areas are progressive, but adverse spillover impacts are regressive. Capitalized benefits at levee construction do not vary by race, but racial sorting occurs post-construction. The local political economy of levee construction can explain the distribution of winners and losers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The child mental health crisis has been described as the “defining public health crisis of our time.” This article addresses three myths about the crisis: (i) the idea that the crisis is new; (ii) the belief that increases in youth suicide mainly reflect deterioration in children’s underlying mental health; and (iii) the myth that investments in children have little impact on children’s mental health. In fact, the cri- sis has existed for decades, youth suicides vary asynchronously with other mental health measures and are impacted by external factors such as firearms legislation, and investments can improve child mental health and prevent suicide.</content>

    <title>The Impact of Increased Exposure of Diversity on Suburban Students' Outcomes: An Analysis of the METCO Voluntary Desegregation Program</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over sixty years following Brown vs. Board of Education, racial and socioeconomic segregation and lack of equal access to educational opportunities persist. Across the country, voluntary desegregation busing programs aim to ameliorate these imbalances and disparities. A longstanding Massachusetts program, METCO, buses K-12 students of color from Boston and Springfield, Massachusetts to 37 suburban districts that voluntarily enroll urban students. Supporters of the program argue that it prepares students to be active citizens in our multicultural society. Opponents question the value of the program and worry it may have a negative impact on suburban student outcomes. I estimate the causal effect of exposure to diversity through the METCO program by using two types of variation: difference-in-difference analysis of schools stopping and starting their METCO enrollment and two-stage least squares analysis of space availability for METCO students. Both methods rule out substantial test score, attendance, or suspension effects of having METCO peers. Classroom ability distribution and classroom suspension rates remain similar when METCO programs start and stop. There is no negative impact on college preparation, competitiveness, persistence, or graduation.</content>

    <title>Subscriptions to Prescriptions: Lessons from Louisiana’s Effort to Eliminate Hepatitis C</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Hepatitis C is a major public health concern due to its high rates of infection and mortality. Recent breakthroughs in pharmaceuticals not only have the potential to cure hepatitis C but could also cause large positive health externalities through reduced transmission. The high cost of these drugs under traditional reimbursement schemes create large obstacles to care, but a recent first-of-its-kind two-part tariff system in Louisiana aims to circumvent these obstacles using a modified subscription model with an exclusive pharmaceutical provider. Under this model, the medication is provided at no marginal cost to the state to cover the state's Medicaid and incarcerated population. This creates an incentive for Louisiana to aggressively test and treat as many patients as possible in order to maximize the benefits of this agreement. Using a number of different data sources, we implement synthetic control and event-study specifications, and find that detection and treatment of hepatitis C increased dramatically, with meaningful reductions in hepatitis C-related mortality and liver transplants after this agreement. Finally, after calculating the Marginal Value of Public Funds of this agreement, we find that the program more than pays for itself.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How should governments structure primary sovereign bond markets when investors face asymmetric uncertainty about default risk and total demand? Standard protocols either use uniform prices for all investors, or price discriminate based on bid prices (“pay as bid”). Uniform pricing encourages more bidding by uninformed investors but price discrimination captures inframarginal surplus. Based on this tradeoff, we analyze a potential protocol that features price discrimination on inframarginal bids and uniform pricing on marginal bids, thereby reducing the mean and variance of public borrowing costs. We also offer new evidence on the information content of primary bond markets which supports our framework.</content>

    <title>The Rise and Fall (and Rise) of the Affordable Care Act: Varying Impacts on Coverage Over Time and Place</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Affordable Care Act (ACA) significantly expanded health insurance in the United States, but its impact has varied across time and states. We assess the law’s heterogeneous impacts over the three presidential administrations since its enactment, as well as across states with different levels of implementation of the law. We focus on Medicaid expansion and Marketplace subsidies, including the enhanced subsidies under the American Rescue Plan of 2021 (ARP). We use national household survey data and a triple-difference design – leveraging variation by time, state, and income – to identify the coverage impacts of the key components of the law. We find that 55% of ACA-related coverage gains between 2013 and 2023 came from Marketplace subsidies – about 37% from the original ACA subsidies and 19% from the ARP enhancements – while 45% were due to Medicaid, including from the "welcome mat" effect. Coverage gains differed substantially across presidential administrations, with Marketplace subsidies proving roughly 30% more effective under Presidents Obama and Biden than under President Trump. The same subsidy amount was more than twice as effective in states with their own Marketplaces than in states relying on the federal Marketplace. Our findings highlight that while the ACA’s explicit economic features drive coverage gains, their effectiveness can be substantially enhanced or hindered through federal and state implementation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When estimating the effects of treatments defined by complex formulas, researchers often use simple functions of exogenous shocks as instruments. A leading example is “simulated instruments” for public policy eligibility, which capture variation in state-level policy generosity. We show how more powerful instruments can be constructed by incorporating heterogeneous shock exposure while using a recentering procedure to avoid bias. We characterize the asymptotically efficient instruments in this class and propose an algorithm for constructing feasible approximations to them. Compared to a simulated instrument approach, our approach yields a 44% smaller standard error on the private insurance crowd-out effect of Medicaid enrollment from the 2014 Affordable Care Act expansions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The motherhood penalty is well-documented, but what happens at the other end of the reproductive spectrum? Menopause—a transition often marked by debilitating physical and psychological symptoms—also entails substantial costs. Using population-wide Norwegian and Swedish data and quasi-experimental methods, we show that a menopause diagnosis leads to lasting drops in earnings and employment, alongside greater reliance on social transfers. The impact is especially severe for women with lower socioeconomic status. Increasing access to menopause-related health care can help offset these losses. Our findings reveal the hidden economic toll of menopause and the potential gains from better support policies.</content>

    <title>Choosing Wisely: Evaluating Latent Factor Models in the Presence of a Contaminated Instrumental Variable with Varying Strength</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Causal inference methods are widely used in empirical research; however, there is a paucity of evidence on the properties of shared latent factor estimators in the presence of contaminated instrumental variable (IV) when a strong IV may not be available. We present a theoretical formulation to depict how the strength and degree of contamination of the IV simultaneously determine the optimal choice of estimator. We perform Monte Carlo simulations with four outcome variables and an endogenous treatment variable, with sample sizes of 1000 and 2000, and for 1000 iterations, to compare the finite sample properties of the OLS, 2SLS, Shared Latent Factor without IV (SLF), and Shared Latent Factor with IV (SLF+IV) estimators. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed estimators to study the causal impact of maternal parity on various maternal and child health indicators: child’s height-for-age percentile, child’s weight-for-age percentile, child’s haemoglobin count, and mother’s haemoglobin count, using data from the 2019-21 Round 5 of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) from India. Our simulation results indicate that for a given degree of contamination of the IV, there exists a threshold strength of the IV, such that the SLF+IV estimator has a lower (greater) bias than the SLF estimator when the strength of the IV lies above (below) that threshold. The empirical results suggest that a lower parity is associated with higher height-for-age and weight-for-age percentile and haemoglobin count in children and a higher haemoglobin count in mothers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Beginning in January 2021, over less than two years, credit card usage by small U.S. businesses nearly doubled, interest payments rose by 60%, and delinquencies reached 2.8%. In this paper, we utilize near real-time QuickBooks data from over 1.6 million small businesses and a targeted survey to highlight the critical role that credit card financing plays in small business activity. We find, first, monthly credit card payments were up to three times higher than loan payments during this time. Second, we use targeted surveys of these small businesses to establish credit cards as a key financing source in response to firm-level shocks, such as uncertain cash flows and overdue invoices. Third, we highlight the critical role of credit cards as a key financial transmission mechanism. Following the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes in early 2022, banks cut credit card supply, leading to a 15.75% drop in balances and a 10% decline in revenue growth, as well as a 1.5% decrease in employment growth among U.S. small businesses. These higher rates also rendered interest payments unsustainable for many, contributing to half of the observed increase in delinquencies. Lastly, a simple heterogeneous firm model with a cash-in-hand constraint illustrates the significant macroeconomic impact of credit card financing on small business activity.</content>

    <title>Where Have All the Good Jobs Gone? Changes in the Geography of Work in the US, 1980-2021</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine changes in the spatial distribution of good jobs across US commuting zones over  1980-2000 and 2000-2021. We define good jobs as those in industries in which full-time workers attain high wages, accounting for individual and regional characteristics. The share of good jobs in manufacturing has plummeted; for college graduates,  good jobs have shifted to (mostly tradable) business, professional, and IT services, while for those without a BA they have shifted to (non-tradable) construction. There is strong persistence in where good jobs are located. Over the last four decades, places with larger concentrations of good job industries have tended to hold onto them, consistent with a model of proportional growth. Turning to regional specialization in good job industries, we find evidence of mean reversion. Commuting zones with larger initial concentrations of good jobs have thus seen even faster growth in lower-wage (and mostly non-tradable) services. Changing regional employment patterns are most pronounced among racial minorities and the foreign-born, who are relatively concentrated in fast growing cities of the South and West. Therefore, good job regions today look vastly different than in 1980: they are more centered around human-capital-intensive tradable services, are surrounded by larger concentrations of low-wage, non-tradable industries, and are more demographically diverse.</content>

    <title>Hotelling Meets Keynes: Aggregate Adjustment with Spatial Competition and Nominal Rigidity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper embeds a circular Hotelling model of spatial competition into a new-Keynesian model with staggered price setting. The resulting framework provides microfoundations for a cost-push shock, taking the form of random variations in transportation costs. An increase in transportation costs raises price markups and is contractionary and inflationary. Spatial frictions also have consequences for the propagation of aggregate demand disturbances (including monetary shocks), as they dampen their output effects and amplify their inflationary effects. Empirically, the paper shows that the cost of time spent shopping represents a significant fraction of consumption expenditure, suggesting that spatial frictions broadly defined are a nonnegligible feature of aggregate demand.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The U.S. government has funded university research for nearly 80 years, with a signiﬁcant share of this funding supporting the fixed costs of science through indirect cost recovery (ICR). We explain the history, objectives, and mechanics of ICR policy and review key controversies. We also provide new empirical evidence on indirect costs at the NIH, a major target of past and present ICR reform. Using data from over 350 institutions, we find that while negotiated ICR rates average 58%, effective rates—what NIH actually pays—average 42%, with relatively little variation across institutions or over time. Our analyses also suggest that a proposed 15% ﬂat rate would significantly cut NIH funding for many grantees, disproportionately affecting institutions most linked to commercial patenting and drug development. We conclude by assessing the current system, and major reform proposals, across several ICR policy objectives: support for research and infrastructure, cost-efficiency incentives, implementation costs, and transparency. No single approach dominates on all dimensions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Revolving door laws restrict public officials from representing private interests before government after leaving office. While these laws mitigate potential conflicts of interest, they also may affect the pool of candidates for public positions by lowering the financial benefits of holding office. We study the consequences of revolving door laws for political selection in U.S. state legislatures, exploiting the staggered roll-out of laws across states over time. We find that fewer new candidates enter politics in treated states and that incumbent legislators are less likely to leave office, leading to an increase in uncontested elections. The decline in entry is particularly strong for independent and more moderate candidates, which may increase polarization. We provide a model of politician career incentives to interpret the results.</content>

    <title>Class Disparities and Discrimination in Traffic Stops and Searches</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine class disparities and discrimination in police searches and stops using data on traffic stops conducted by Texas Highway Patrol. Low-income motorists are more likely to be searched for contraband, less likely to be found with contraband when searched, and more likely to be stopped for infractions associated with pretext stops. We measure class-based discrimination in searches per potential stop, accounting for both the search and stop margins. Our research design leverages motorists stopped in multiple vehicles conveying different class signals. Motorists are more likely to be searched when stopped in a low-status vehicle, and evidence suggests that they are also more likely to be stopped when driving one. Marginal searches triggered by vehicle status are also less likely to yield contraband when the motorist is low-income. We argue that lower hassle costs associated with arrests of low-income motorists help explain trooper behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Browser data from an approximately representative sample of individual investors offers a detailed account of their search for information, including how much time they spend on stock research, which stocks they research, what categories of information they seek, and when they gather information relative to events and trades. The median individual investor spends approximately six minutes on research per trade on traded tickers, mostly just before the trade; the mean spends around half an hour. Individual investors spend the most time reviewing price charts, followed by analyst opinions, and exhibit little interest in traditional risk statistics. Aggregate research interest is highly correlated with stock size, and salient news and earnings announcements draw more attention. Individual investors have different research styles, and those that focus on short-term information are more likely to trade more speculative stocks.</content>

    <title>Mechanism Design for Personalized Policy: A Field Experiment Incentivizing Exercise</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Personalizing policies can theoretically increase their effectiveness. However, personalization is difficult when individual types are unobservable and the preferences of policymakers and individuals are not aligned, which could cause individuals to misreport their type. Mechanism design offers a strategy to overcome this issue: offer an “incentive-compatible” menu of policy choices designed to induce participants to select the variant intended for their type. Using a field experiment that personalized incentives for exercise among 6,800 adults with diabetes and hypertension in urban India, we show that personalizing with an incentive-compatible choice menu substantially improves program performance, increasing the treatment effect of incentives on exercise by 80% without increasing program costs relative to a one-size-fits-all benchmark. Mechanism design achieves similar performance to personalizing with an extensive set of observable variables, but without the high data requirements or the risk that participants might manipulate their observables.</content>

    <title>Information-Concealing Credit Architecture</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When the value of a pledgeable asset (or project) is uncertain, investors are tempted to examine it. The asset owner ultimately bears the information cost, reducing her financing capacity. A pecking order emerges. Debt generates a greater financing capacity than equity: unlike equity investors who own the asset directly, creditors own the asset only if the borrower defaults and, therefore, have weaker incentives to acquire information. Probabilistic asset ownership can be further diluted by introducing intermediaries between the borrower and the creditor, leading to a new theory of financial intermediation and credit chains. We demonstrate that the optimal financial architecture involves systematically sequencing multiple intermediaries with heterogeneous information costs and asset correlations, rationalizing the seemingly excessive complexity of intermediated credit flows.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a spatial equilibrium model with heterogeneous households holding general non-homothetic preferences over tradable goods and housing. In equilibrium, desirable and productive locations command high housing prices. So long as housing is a necessity, these locations are disproportionately inhabited by high-income earners who are relatively less affected by high housing prices. We clarify how this source of sorting complements other potential sorting forces in spatial equilibrium models, namely, comparative advantage in production and heterogeneous preferences for locations. We show how to measure changes in welfare inequality across income groups in a theoretically-consistent way when housing is a necessity, extending the approach popular in models with homothetic preferences. We use our framework to track the evolution of welfare inequality between college and non-college graduates in the United States between 1980 and 2020. We find that, accounting for change in prices, it has risen by more than nominal wage inequality, even as college graduates increasingly sort into cities with expensive housing over this time period.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firm characteristics, based on accounting and financial market data, are commonly used to represent firms in economics and finance. However, investors collectively use a much richer information set beyond firm characteristics, including sources of information that are not readily available to researchers. We show theoretically that portfolio holdings contain all relevant information for asset pricing, which can be recovered under empirically realistic conditions. Such guarantees do not exist for other data sources, such as accounting or text data. We build on recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) that represent unstructured data (e.g., text, audio, and images) by high-dimensional latent vectors called embeddings. Just as word embeddings leverage the document structure to represent words, asset embeddings leverage portfolio holdings to represent firms. Thus, this paper is a bridge from recent advances in AI and ML to economics and finance. We explore various methods to estimate asset embeddings, including recommender systems, shallow neural network models such as Word2Vec, and transformer models such as BERT. We evaluate the performance of these models on three benchmarks that can be evaluated using a single quarter of data: predicting relative valuations, explaining the comovement of stock returns, and predicting institutional portfolio decisions. We also estimate investor embeddings (i.e., representations of investors and their strategies), which are useful for investor classification, performance evaluation, and detecting crowded trades. We discuss other applications of asset embeddings, including generative portfolios, risk management, and stress testing. Finally, we develop a framework to give an economic narrative to a group of similar firms, by applying large language models to firm-level text data.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore the role of memory for choice behavior in unfamiliar environments. Using a unique data set, we document that  decision makers exhibit a "memory premium." They tend to choose in-memory alternatives over out-of-memory ones, even when the latter are objectively better. Consistent with well-established regularities regarding the inner workings of human memory, the memory premium is associative, subject to interference and repetition effects, and decays over time. Even as decision makers gain familiarity with the environment, the memory premium remains economically large. Our results imply that the ease with which past experiences come to mind plays an important role in shaping choice behavior.</content>

    <title>Moral Hazard under Liquidity Constraints</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Spending induced by health insurance is often called moral hazard and definitionally assumed to be inefficient. We adapt standard models and show that for those living "hand-to-mouth", the financing benefits of insurance cause a portion of moral hazard to be efficient. Although insurance's price distortions also create some inefficient spending, the net welfare impacts of moral hazard can be positive. We present an intuitive graphical framework and formal results to distinguish moral hazard’s efficient and inefficient components. Simulations show economically significant net benefits of moral hazard in many cases. Our framework also provides a new way of modeling the "income effect'" induced by  insurance, and distinguishes it from the "liquidity effect". While both can lead to efficient moral hazard, moral-hazard benefits from the "liquidity effect" are often substantially larger. We use our framework to revisit prior estimates of Medicaid’s value from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment. For individuals with minimal liquidity, Medicaid's value is more than twice prior estimates.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The slow adoption of climate change policies stems from concerns about their economic impact. The EU has led global carbon pricing through its Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). This study examines the effect of ETS policy shocks on global stock market returns at the country-industry level using linear and spatial autoregression models. Results show that while markets react negatively to rising carbon prices, the impact is small in magnitude. Global spillovers are limited to sectors linked to EU industries via intermediate goods trade, with no significant effects beyond these supply chain linkages. Overall, the unintended consequences of EU climate policies appear negligible, with minimal effects on targeted industries’ stock returns and no spillovers outside supply chain linkages.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) supplies livelihoods and critical minerals but has been linked to conflict and environmental degradation. We enable monitoring of this largely informal sector by creating high-resolution maps of ASM's footprint in Africa using machine learning models that integrate geographic features and satellite imagery. We find ASM is more extensive than documented: in five countries with on-the-ground surveys, we predict over 231,000 1-km2 grid cells [±2 standard errors: 170,153-297,710] contain ASM activity – over 40 times that recorded by surveyors. Adapting methods for spatial domain adaptation, we map ASM across 20 total countries, estimating that 4% [2-8%] of territory and 17% [10-30%] of the population are impacted by ASM, which encroaches on a larger share of settlements and ecosystems than previously understood.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Tokens offer convenience in digital networks and earn rewards when staked for consensus generation or economic activities. In our continuous-time model, agents dynamically allocate wealth over on-platform transactions and staking. Aggregate staking ratio crucially shapes platform productivity, grows userbase, and links staking to endogenous reward rates and price dynamics. Transaction fees, token issuance, and user heterogeneity all affect platform lifecycle. Empirical findings support the theoretical predictions: (i) correlation between staking ratio and reward rate is cross-sectionally positive, but time-series-wise negative; (ii) staking ratios positively predict excess returns; (iii) the convenience wedge generates UIP violations and significant crypto carry premia.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Oracles are software components that enable data exchange between siloed blockchains and external environments, enhancing smart contract capabilities and platform interoperability. Oracles play key roles in decentralized finance and blockchain applications in centralized finance. We find that integration into decentralized oracle networks is positively associated with key measures of economic activity such as Total Value Locked, triggered by positive network effects in adoption and usage. Our study reveals symbiotic gains from enhanced interoperability and network effects across protocols on a given chain and among integrated chains. Oracle integration appears to improve risk-sharing and mitigates contagion, increasing resilience during turbulent periods in crypto markets. Overall, oracles emerge as a crucial component to enable informational and economic integration in decentralized finance ecosystems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how artificial intelligence transforms the core pillars of collaboration—performance, expertise sharing, and social engagement—through a pre-registered field experiment with 776 professionals at Procter &amp; Gamble, a global consumer packaged goods company. Working on real product innovation challenges, professionals were randomly assigned to work either with or without AI, and either individually or with another professional in new product development teams. Our findings reveal that AI significantly enhances performance: individuals with AI matched the performance of teams without AI, demonstrating that AI can effectively replicate certain benefits of human collaboration. Moreover, AI breaks down functional silos. Without AI, R&amp;D professionals tended to suggest more technical solutions, while Commercial professionals leaned towards commercially-oriented proposals. Professionals using AI produced balanced solutions, regardless of their professional background. Finally, AI’s language-based interface prompted more positive self-reported emotional responses among participants, suggesting it can fulfill part of the social and motivational role traditionally offered by human teammates. Our results suggest that AI adoption at scale in knowledge work reshapes not only performance but also how expertise and social connectivity manifest within teams, compelling organizations to rethink the very structure of collaborative work.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) indicate an unprecedented 43 percent increase in the number of people residing in homeless shelters in the United States between 2022 and 2024, reversing the gradual decline over the preceding sixteen years. Three-quarters of this rise was concentrated in four localities – New York City, Chicago, Massachusetts, and Denver – where large inflows of new immigrants seeking asylum were housed in emergency shelters. Using direct estimates from local government sources and indirect methods based on demographic changes, we estimate that asylum seekers accounted for about 60 percent of the two-year rise in sheltered homelessness during this period, challenging media and policy narratives that primarily attribute this rise to local economic conditions and housing affordability.</content>

    <title>Failures of Contingent Reasoning in Annuitization Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies psychological biases in take-up of annuities, using an incentivized experiment with a probability-based sample (N = 3,038). Choosing an annuity was payoff-maximizing in the experiment at all prices, but take-up was incomplete and price elastic. Reformulating decisions as insurance against a “bad” outcome rather than insurance against “longevity risk” did not increase take-up. Instead, we find substantial failures of contingent reasoning: participants under-appreciated how annuitization mitigated the need for less-efficient means of saving for retirement. Increasing the salience of the interaction with savings decisions, or eliminating the need to think through this interaction altogether, substantially increased annuity take-up.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We measure the level and growth of education segregation in American workplaces from 2000 to 2020. American workplaces show an educational segregation, measured by the degree to which the establishment has mostly workers of similar education levels, that is comparable to racial residential segregation in a typical metro area. Workplace isolation was particularly high for young and male workers without college degrees. The isolation of non-college workers is increasing over time.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is much disagreement about the extent to which financial incentives motivate study participants. We elicit preferences for being paid for completing a survey, including a one-in-twenty chance of winning a $100 electronic gift card, a guaranteed electronic gift card with the same expected value, and an option to refuse payment. More than twice as many participants chose the lottery as chose the guaranteed payment.  Given that most people are risk averse, this pattern suggests that factors beyond risk preferences—such as hassle costs—influenced their decision-making. Almost 20 percent of participants actively refused payment, demonstrating low monetary motivation. We find both systematic and unobserved heterogeneity in the characteristics of who turned down payment. The propensity to refuse payment is more than four times as large among individuals 50 and older compared to younger individuals, suggesting a tradeoff between financially motivating participants and obtaining a representative sample. Overall, our results suggest that modest electronic gift card payments violate key requirements of Vernon Smith’s induced value theory.</content>

    <title>Counting the Poor: The Liquidity-Adjusted Supplemental Expenditure Poverty Measure</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most poverty calculations use income-based or consumption-based measures. We introduce a new, third measure of poverty status which is based on household expenditure. Expenditure is the theoretically correct measure of resources actually transferred into a given period in the life cycle. But the presence of illiquid service flows from durable goods, which can only be used to purchase that good in the minimum standard of living bundle and no other good, requires an adjustment both to resources and to the poverty threshold to allow a proper comparison of liquid resources to liquidity-adjusted thresholds. We also show that the expenditure impact of transfers on the poverty rate requires an adjustment for effects of transfers on precautionary saving and for their role as consumption insurance. Using the 2009-2022 Consumer Expenditure Survey, our liquidity-adjusted poverty measure yields a 2022 poverty rate of 8.3 percent, declining by 11 percent since 2009. Our measure trends in broadly similar ways to income- and consumption-based measures but only because differences in how thresholds and resources are calculated are offsetting. We also find that accounting for precautionary saving and the insurance role of transfers could make the anti-poverty impact of transfers somewhat smaller than that estimated ignoring these effects.</content>

    <title>AI as Strategist</title>
    <updated>2025-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Joshua S. Gans</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the role of artificial intelligence as a strategist in organizational decision-making by extending van den Steen's formal theory of strategy. A mathematical model is developed comparing AI and human strategists across different decision contexts, focusing on how each type generates confidence, achieves agreement, and implements decisions through control versus influence. The analysis presumes that AI excels in data-rich domains but faces credibility challenges in judgment-intensive contexts, creating a counterintuitive result where AI requires less formal authority precisely where it demonstrates superior analytical capabilities. The paper identifies distinct mechanisms through which strategic value is created: direct decision quality improvement and enhanced coordination. The authors propose domain-contingent approaches to AI integration, including differentiated authority systems across decision types and progressive control models that evolve as AI demonstrates effectiveness. These findings contribute to strategy theory while providing practical guidance for organizations seeking to effectively integrate AI into strategic processes, highlighting that organizations must adapt to their strategists' capabilities as much as strategists must match their organizations.</content>

    <title>The Conflict-of-Interest Discount in the Marketplace of Ideas</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how conflicts of interest (CoI)—defined as financial, professional, or ideological stakes held by authors—affect perceived credibility in economics research. Using a randomized controlled survey of both economists and a representative sample of the U.S. public, we find that the presence of a CoI reduces trust in a paper’s findings by 28% on average, with substantial heterogeneity across conflict types. We develop a model in which this reduction in trust reflects both the prevalence of conflicted papers and the expected bias conditional on conflict. To isolate the latter, we introduce the CoI Discount: the perceived value of a conflicted paper relative to an otherwise identical, non-conflicted one. We estimate an average CoI Discount of 39%, implying that conflicted papers are valued at just 61% of non-conflicted ones. We validate these survey-based estimates through three complementary exercises: an empirical analysis of actual citation and disclosure patterns in economics, a meta-analysis of evidence from the medical literature, and simulations using large-language models. Our findings highlight a persistent credibility gap that is not eliminated by current disclosure practices and suggest a broader challenge for scientific trust in the presence of author conflicts.</content>

    <title>The Effects of Deleting Medical Debt from Consumer Credit Reports</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One in seven Americans carry medical debt, with $88 billion reported on consumer credit reports. In April 2023, the three major credit bureaus stopped reporting medical debts below $500. We study the effects of this information deletion on consumer credit scores, credit limits and utilization, repayment behavior, and payday borrowing. Using a machine learning model, we show that small medical debts are not meaningfully predictive of defaults, suggesting their deletion should have minimal effect on lending decisions. We test this prediction using two complementary research designs. First, a regression discontinuity analysis comparing individuals above and below the $500 threshold finds no direct benefits from the information deletion, ruling out small changes in credit access. Second, to assess indirect effects, we classify consumers based on whether their predicted default probability increases or decreases when debts are deleted. A difference-in-differences analysis comparing these groups before and after the 2023 policy change reveals no evidence of negative spillover effects. Finally, we show that larger medical debts (≥ $500) are also not meaningfully predictive of default, suggesting that eliminating medical debts entirely from credit reports, as planned under a January 2025 decision by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is unlikely to affect credit outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a theory of sectoral fluctuations driven by the propagation of demand shocks along supply chains with heterogeneous time-to-build production. We solve the model in closed form. Downstream producers respond directly to current demand. Upstream producers, due to time-to-build delays, respond to anticipated future demand. Consequently, hump-shaped demand shocks to downstream goods propagate and amplify along the supply chain, generating pronounced volatility in upstream sectors and creating the bullwhip effect. Empirically and quantitatively, we show that the bullwhip is significant across downstream sectors that are important for final consumption.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Landmark results from the Women's Health Initiative trial showed that random assignment to menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) elevated risks of breast cancer and other adverse events. Recent analyses argue that MHT risks are small. These analyses report intention-to-treat (ITT) effects, ignoring the fact that many women assigned intervention were non-adherent, while many women assigned control initiated treatment. Instrumental variable (IV) methods and adherence data allow us to estimate effects of MHT on compliers who took MHT if and only if assigned. IV estimates show risks and benefits that are substantially larger than the ITT estimates used to inform MHT guidelines.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This chapter reviews the analysis of non-wage amenities in the workplace. The competitive model is the point of departure, but the emphasis is on models of imperfect competition that have greater empirical relevance. In addition to the traditional hedonic model for estimating preferences over job characteristics, I review revealed-preference methods that are better suited when there are deviations from perfect competition.</content>

    <title>Non-User Utility and Market Power: The Case of Smartphones</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms can increase the demand for their products and consolidate their market power not only by increasing user utility but also by decreasing non-user utility. In this paper, we examine this mechanism by considering the case of smartphones. In particular, Apple has faced criticism for allegedly degrading the Android user experience by making messages to Android devices appear as green bubbles on iPhones—a salient signal often perceived as reflecting a lower socioeconomic status. Using samples of US college students, we show that green bubbles are widely stigmatized and that a majority of both iPhone and Android users would prefer green bubbles to no longer exist. We then conduct an incentivized deactivation experiment, revealing that iPhone users have a significant willingness to pay to prevent their messages from appearing as green bubbles on other iPhones. Next, we examine the market implications of non-user utility and find that respondents are substantially more likely to choose an Android over an iPhone when green bubbles are removed. We conclude by presenting case studies that illustrate how companies use product features to reduce non-user utility in various markets.</content>

    <title>Forward Selection Fama-MacBeth Regression with Higher Order Asset-Pricing Factors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that the higher-orders and their interactions of the common sparse linear factors can effectively subsume the factor zoo. We propose a forward selection Fama-MacBeth procedure as a method to estimate a high-dimensional stochastic discount factor model, isolating the most relevant higher-order factors. Applying this approach to terms derived from six widely used factors (the Fama-French five-factor model and the momentum factor), we show that the resulting higher-order model with only a small number of selected higher-order terms significantly outperforms traditional benchmarks both in-sample and out-of-sample. Moreover, it effectively subsumes a majority of the factors from the extensive factor zoo, suggesting that the pricing power of most zoo factors is attributable to their exposure to higher-order terms of common linear factors.</content>

    <title>Credit, Land Speculation, and Low-Interest-Rate Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper analyses the impact of credit expansions arising from increases in collateral values or lower interest rate policies on long-run productivity and economic growth in a two-sector endogenous growth economy with credit frictions, with the driver of growth lying in one sector (manufacturing) but not in the other (real estate). We show that it is not so much aggregate credit expansion that matters for long-run productivity and economic growth but sectoral credit expansions. Credit expansions associated mainly with relaxation of real estate financing (capital investment financing) will be productivity-and growth-retarding (enhancing). Without financial regulations, low interest rates and more expansionary monetary policy may so encourage land speculation using leverage that productive capital investment and economic growth are decreased. Unlike in standard macroeconomic models, in ours, the equilibrium price of land will be finite even if the safe rate of interest is less than the rate of output growth.</content>

    <title>The Political Consequences of Controversial Education Reform: Lessons from Wisconsin’s Act 10</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Public service reforms often provoke political backlash. Can they also yield political benefits for the politicians who champion them? We study a Wisconsin law that weakened teachers’ unions and liberalized pay, prompting mass protests. Exploiting its staggered implementation across school districts, we find that the reform cut union revenues, raised student test scores, and increased pay for some teachers. Exposure to the law increased the incumbent governor’s vote share by about 20% of his margin of victory and reduced campaign contributions to his opponent. Gains were larger in districts with stronger unions ex ante and in those where more voters benefited from the reform. Our findings highlight how even politically risky reforms can generate electoral benefits under the right circumstances.</content>

    <title>Taxes on Lifetime Income: A Good Idea?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Household consumption and welfare are more strongly associated with lifetime income, but most countries base income taxes on current income and use progressive taxes to reduce inequality and provide social insurance. Is lifetime income a better tax base for a government seeking to provide social insurance and redistribution? To answer this question, we build a quantitative life-cycle model of heterogeneous households with endogenous labor supply and idiosyncratic wage risks, and calibrate it to the U.S. economy. We document that switching to a lifetime income tax leads to a more efficient distribution of hours worked over time and across states of the world. This benefit rises with tax progressivity under a lifetime income tax, whereas the opposite is true under an annual income tax. Consequently, the optimal lifetime income tax is more progressive and achieves larger ex-ante welfare for a cohort of households than the optimal annual income tax.</content>

    <title>Measuring Human Leadership Skills with AI Agents</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that leadership skill with artificially intelligent (AI) agents predicts leadership skill with human groups. In a large pre-registered lab experiment, human leaders worked with AI agents to solve problems. Their performance on this “AI leadership test” was strongly correlated (ρ=0.81) with their causal impact as leaders of human teams, which we estimate by repeatedly randomly assigning leaders to groups of human followers and measuring team performance. Successful leaders of both humans and AI agents ask more questions and engage in more conversational turn-taking; they score higher on measures of social intelligence, fluid intelligence, and decision-making skill, but do not differ in gender, age, ethnicity or education. Our findings indicate that AI agents can be effective proxies for human participants in social experiments, which greatly simplifies the measurement of leadership and teamwork skills.</content>

    <title>Voluntary Report of Standardized Test Scores: An Experimental Study</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt; NBER Working Papers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The past few years have seen a shift in many universities' admission policies from test-required to either test-optional or test-blind. This paper uses laboratory experiments to examine students' reporting behavior given their application package and the school's interpretation of non-reported standardized test scores. We find that voluntary disclosure is incomplete and selective, supporting the incentives of both partial unraveling and reverse unraveling. Subjects exhibit some ability to learn about the hidden school interpretation, though their learning is imperfect. Using a structural model of student reporting behavior, we simulate the potential tradeoff between academic preparedness and diversity in a school's admission cohort. We find that, if students have perfect information about the school's interpretation of non-reporting, test-blind is the worst and test-required is the best in both dimensions, while test-optional lies between the two extremes. When students do not have perfect information, some test-optional policies can generate more diversity than test-required, because some students with better observable attributes may underestimate the penalty on their non-reporting. This allows the school to admit more students that have worse observable attributes but report. We test the results’ robustness to a variety of extensions.</content>
