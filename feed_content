    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Jointly Making Inventory Stocking and Assortment Offering DecisionsMaking the product assortment offer decisions for a customer requires keeping a balance between offering an assortment that will satisfy the current customer and reserving the products with scarce inventories for the customers who will arrive in the future. Therefore, whereas the assortment offer decisions should depend on the current inventories of the products, the stocking decisions should anticipate how the offered assortments will deplete the inventories, thereby creating a natural interaction between inventory stocking and assortment offer decisions. In “Coordinated Inventory Stocking and Assortment Customization,” Bai, El Housni, Rusmevichientong, and Topaloglu develop models that jointly make the assortment offer and inventory stocking decisions. Their models allocate the limited stocking capacity to the inventories for different products, while taking into consideration the assortment offer decisions that will be made for the customers arriving over a selling horizon.</content>

    <title>The Last Hurrah Effect: End-of-Period Temporal Landmarks Increase Optimism and Financial Risk-Taking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Understanding what drives risk-taking is fundamental for the study of choice under uncertainty. One widely discussed question is when and why people engage in risk-taking. Prior work finds evidence for an ending effect, where risk-taking increases on the last gamble in a series when outcomes are immediately realized. The authors test whether socially ubiquitous end-of-period temporal landmarks (e.g., last day of the work week, month, year) alter financial risk-taking even when outcomes are not immediate. Using data from a large peer-to-peer investment platform in the United States, they show that investors make riskier financial investment decisions on Fridays relative to those made earlier in the week. Consistent with a broader end-of-period effect, risk-taking also increases on the last day of the month, on the last day of the year, and on weekdays prior to a long weekend. Follow-up lab experiments identify a novel mechanism driving ending effects: As people near the end of a temporal period, they feel more optimistic that their financial risks will pay off, driving greater financial risk-taking. The shift in risk-taking is not without consequence: In this specific peer-to-peer context, the authors show that end-of-period investments perform worse over time, losing money relative to investments made on other days.</content>

    <title>The Relationship Between Organizational Authenticity Perceptions and Employees’ Work Performance: Evidence From a Field Experiment</title>
    <updated>2025-02-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The concept of organizational authenticity—the consistency between an organization’s espoused values and its lived practices—has garnered considerable interest in academic discourse. While the authenticity literature has paid much attention to external stakeholders (e.g., clients), the notion of organizational authenticity perceptions of an important stakeholder—employees—has been understudied. Despite prior evidence of external stakeholders’ positive reactions to organizational authenticity perceptions, whether and how it can also affect employees and their work performance remains an open question. I undertook a randomized field experiment in a large, global consulting company to examine how employee perceptions of organizational authenticity affect their work performance. Compared with the control group, those who perceived their organization as authentic demonstrated higher performance. I show evidence that employee trust in the organization mediates the relationship between employee perceptions of organizational authenticity and work performance. Alternative mediators—organizational identification and organizational likability—did not explain this relationship. The study’s results advance the literature by revealing the important role of organizational authenticity perceptions among an internal stakeholder—employees—and the way it affects work performance.</content>

    <title>Repo over the Financial Crisis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper uses new data to provide a comprehensive view of repo activity during the 2007 global financial crisis. We show that activity declined much more in the bilateral segment of the market than in the tri‐party segment. Surprisingly, a large share of the decline in activity is driven by repos backed by Treasury securities. Further, a disproportionate share of the decline in repo activity is connected to securities dealer's market‐making activity. In particular, the evidence suggests that at least part of the decline is not driven by clients pulling away from securities dealers because of counterparty credit concerns.</content>

    <title>Digital Goods Reselling: Implications on Cannibalization and Price Discrimination</title>
    <updated>2025-02-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The resale of used products presents the challenge of cannibalization, particularly pronounced in digital goods markets where perfect substitutes are easily replicable. In this article, we assert that, rather than a threat, resale can serve as an effective pricing tool for managing heterogeneous demand. We consider a seller of digital goods/services who offers a contract to a heterogeneous group of customers at a fixed price for a specified amount of usage allowance. Rather than imposing restrictive sharing barriers, the seller allows subscribers to share their allowances with others in a secondary market. Our analysis reveals that the seller’s optimal strategy involves facilitating resale by eliminating transaction costs. The sharing contract effectively achieves the same outcome as a two-part tariff, wherein subscribers pay an entry fee along with a marginal usage rate. Both approaches generate equivalent revenue and market coverage, and result in idential demand and individual surplus for customers of the same type. Consequently, the sharing contract acts as a mechanism for price discrimination. Our finding provides a new perspective on peer-to-peer resales and also challenges the conventional belief that successful price discrimination hinges on preventing resale.</content>

    <title>Deterministic Budget-Feasible Clock Auctions</title>
    <updated>2025-02-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the budget-feasible mechanism design problem, an auctioneer with a strict budget constraint is looking to acquire services from a set of self-interested providers. The auctioneer aims to design a polynomial-time strategy-proof mechanism that maximizes the value of the services she acquires, subject to the sum of payments to providers falling within her budget. This problem has attracted a great deal of attention due to its combination of practical relevance and theoretical depth. In “Deterministic Budget-Feasible Clock Auctions,” Balkanski, Garimidi, Gkatzelis, Schoepflin, and Tan provide the first such deterministic mechanism that achieves a constant-factor approximation for instances where the auctioneer’s valuation function is submodular. Moreover, this mechanism achieves an improved approximation even compared with previously known randomized mechanisms, and it takes the form of a clock auction, implying a suite of important properties that make this auction much more practical.</content>

    <title>Antisocial Responses to the “Coal to Gas” Regulation: An Unintended Consequence of a Residential Energy Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Policies geared toward environmental and economic improvement could unexpectedly lead to negative consequences in other dimensions. Such cases raise a red flag to economists and policymakers who aim to deliver comprehensive and sensible policy evaluations. This article investigates antisocial behaviors in response to the Clean Winter Heating Policy (CWHP), which seeks to improve outdoor air quality. Our results show that participating villagers are more likely to violate laws to burn agricultural waste and exhibit lower prosociality in incentivized dictator games and public goods games. We further explore treatment heterogeneities and find that two channels are likely to play a part. First, the CWHP was perceived as a negative income shock. Therefore, the villagers would want to reduce their expenditure on straw disposal and behave less generously in the incentivized games. Second, the CWHP could trigger discontent and directly affect social preference. Additional evidence suggests that the antisocial (less prosocial) responses could have been avoided by granting larger upfront subsidies.This paper was accepted by Axel Ockenfels, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: J.

    <title>The Golden Halo of Defaults in Simple Choices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Defaults are pervasive in consumer choice. The authors combine eye-tracking laboratory experiments with cognitive modeling to pinpoint the influence of defaults in the decision process and conduct naturalistic experiments with large preregistered samples to test the limits of defaults on consumer choices. Contrary to previous assumptions, in simple binary choices, default options did not potentiate rapid heuristic-based decisions but instead altered processes of attention and valuation. Model comparison indicated that defaults received a positive boost in value—a “golden halo”—that was large enough to increase hedonic choices when the default was hedonic, but had limited effects for utilitarian defaults or for when defaults were incongruent with background goals. The findings illustrate and quantify the mechanisms through which default options shape subsequent decisions in simple choices. Further, the authors establish boundary conditions for when defaults can and cannot be used to nudge consumer choice.</content>

    <title>Are We Worse Off After Policy Repeals? Evidence from Two Green Policies</title>
    <updated>2025-02-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Implementation of public policies sometimes results in spillover effects on nontargeted outcomes. When policy makers repeal these policies due to industry pressure and community resistance, do the spillover effects from the policy persist after a repeal? Specifically, the authors ask (1) whether these spillovers induced by policy, when present, carry on after a repeal (i.e., become “carryovers”); (2) how these carryovers evolve over the short and medium term; and (3) what benefit thresholds the policy must meet to offset spillovers during implementation and carryovers after repeal. To address these questions, the authors examine two pro-environment policies that were later repealed: a ban on single-use plastic grocery bags and the imposition of a fee. They find that the increase in trash bag sales, which began during policy implementation, persisted for several months after repeal. A break-even analysis suggests that the net effect on plastic bag savings is likely positive even after repeal. Only modest reductions in grocery bag use would be needed to break even, suggesting a favorable outcome for the environment. This study alerts policy makers and firms to potential carryovers from policy repeals that can persist well after a repeal.</content>

    <title>Retailer Differentiation in Social Media: An Investigation of Firm-Generated Content on Twitter</title>
    <updated>2025-02-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media platforms have been used by firms for a variety of purposes: building firms’ brand image, increasing customer engagement, and providing customer service, among others. However, there is little research on content strategies adopted by traditional rival firms competing on online social media platforms. This article seeks to fill this gap by examining whether retailers traditionally identified as close competitors mirror this rivalry in their social media content strategies on Twitter (now known as X). To this end, this study introduces a new metric for assessing competition on online social media, based on content similarity. The authors find that retailers competing closely in traditional contexts show greater divergence in their content strategies on social media, and firms whose social media content strategies are less similar to content strategies of their close traditional rivals benefit from higher engagement and acquire new followers faster. In examining the mechanism of the effect, the authors find that these divergent firms’ improved performance is attributable to their superior ability to leverage the higher-level affordances of Twitter as compared with their rivals. The results of this study offer valuable insights for firms seeking to distinguish their social media content from that of their competitors.</content>

    <title>Sponsored Content as an Epistemic Market Object: How Platformization of Brand–Creator Partnerships Disrupts Valuation, Coproduction, and the Relationship Between Market Actors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sponsored content allows brands to partner with creators to reach creators’ audiences on digital platforms. However, both creators’ and brands’ incomplete understanding of this object generates two critical ambiguities: how to determine the value of sponsored content and how to effectively coproduce it. To better understand these ambiguities, the authors theorize sponsored content as an epistemic market object: an object that facilitates marketing functions but is only partially understood by the actors who use it . They analyze a dataset of interviews, podcasts, media articles, and third-party platform reviews about—and by—content creators, brands, and intermediaries. The findings show that brands, creators, and intermediaries create and apply knowledge to address valuation and coproduction ambiguities. However, this knowledge work is incomplete, creating asymmetries in value outcomes and power relationships in a brand–creator partnership. This research contributes to marketing literature and practice by highlighting the role of epistemic market objects in transformative market disruptions that alter the roles of, and the relationships between, market actors. The findings are transferable to other substantive areas such as generative artificial intelligence, the metaverse, nonfungible tokens, online news, and the sharing economy.</content>

    <title>Agent-Oriented Impression Management: Who Wins When Firms Publicize Their New CEOs?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this study, we advance organizational impression management research by focusing on agent-oriented impression management—which reflects attempts to create value for the firm by publicizing individuals or groups who are agents of the firm. Although prevalent in practice, agent-oriented impression management remains unexplored in scholarly research. Specifically, we introduce the concept of new CEO prominence in firm communication (PFC), defined as the frequency and centrality of new CEO mentions in firm press releases and social media. We argue that new CEO PFC is distinct from traditional impression management tactics because CEOs are agents of the firm that will personally benefit from these impression management strategies. Thus, our research addresses the question: Who captures the value associated with new CEO PFC? We theorize that firms benefit from featuring new CEOs in firm communication through improved external stakeholder evaluations (i.e., analyst ratings). However, these efforts may also create value for the CEOs, as evidenced by increased compensation, more outside directorships, and decreased turnover rates. Our empirical study of efforts to publicize a new CEO following 557 succession events strongly supports our theory.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study links between the labor market for loan officers and access to mortgage credit. Using novel data matching mortgage applications to loan officers, we find that minorities are underrepresented among loan officers. Minority borrowers are less likely to complete mortgage applications, have completed applications approved, and to ultimately take up a loan. These disparities are reduced when minority borrowers work with minority loan officers. These pairings also lead to lower default rates, suggesting minority loan officers have an informational advantage with minority borrowers. Our results suggest minority underrepresentation among loan officers reduces minority borrowers’ access to credit.</content>

    <title>“You Pretend to Pay Me; I Pretend to Work”: A Multi‐Level Exploration of Quiet Quitting in the Greek Context</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study explores quiet quitting—a distinct form of workplace withdrawal—in the Greek context, adopting a multilevel approach to understand how cultural, institutional and individual factors shape this emerging phenomenon. Drawing upon relevant literature, we investigate the macro, meso‐organizational, and micro‐individual level factors that shape the emergence and persistence of quiet quitting. Through a qualitative, interview‐based methodology, we engage with a diverse sample of Greek Human Resource (HR) managers to capture their perceptions and lived experiences of the factors that contribute to quiet quitting. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between societal shifts, cultural norms, organizational practices, and individual coping mechanisms that give rise to and sustain quiet quitting behaviors. We propose a conceptual framework that situates quiet quitting within the unique socio‐cultural, economic, and institutional realities of the Greek context. This framework reveals how quiet quitting manifests as a dynamic process, initiated by psychological contract breaches and perpetuated through cycles of emotional exhaustion and identity rationalization. By providing a holistic understanding of the quiet quitting phenomenon, this study contributes to the advancement of contextualized Human Resource Management (HRM) research and offers valuable insights for practitioners navigating the challenges of the modern workplace.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how humans learn from artificial intelligence (AI), leveraging an introduction of an AI‐powered Go program (APG) that unexpectedly outperformed the best professional player. We compare the move quality of professional players to APG's superior solutions around its public release. Our analysis of 749,190 moves demonstrates significant improvements in players' move quality, especially in the early stages of the game where uncertainty is highest. This improvement was accompanied by a higher alignment with AI's suggestions and a decreased number and magnitude of errors. Young players show greater improvement, suggesting potential inequality in learning from AI. Further, while players of all skill levels benefit, less skilled players gain higher marginal benefits. These findings have implications for managers seeking to adopt and utilize AI in their organizations.Managerial AbstractWe examine how professionals can learn from artificial intelligence (AI) by studying an AI‐powered Go program (APG) that outperformed the best professional player. By analyzing 749,190 moves, we find that players' move quality improved significantly, closely aligning with the AI's recommendations. The number and magnitude of errors also decreased. This learning effect was particularly strong early in the game where decisions are more uncertain. Young players showed greater effect, suggesting that learning from AI may vary by age. While players of all skill levels benefited, those with less skill saw the greatest improvement. These findings highlight the instructional role of AI and offer guidance on how to effectively integrate AI into organizations to enhance worker performance across different age groups and skill levels.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The emotional rollercoaster of entrepreneurship is characterized by encounters with challenges that impede venture progress. Consequently, resilience, which is reflected in the ability to maintain functioning through such challenges, has become of particular interest to scholars. Existing research emphasizes the ability of resilient individuals to use positive emotions to overcome challenges. Yet, scholarship has largely overlooked the role of affective fluctuations in resilience processes, which is problematic for entrepreneurs facing the chahighs and lows of venturing. This daily diary study of technology entrepreneurs reveals that those who are more resilient report smaller day‐to‐day fluctuations in their affective state over the course of two working weeks. This finding suggests that theory on self‐regulation may serve as an important key in understanding the microprocesses underlying resilience.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurship is often considered an emotional rollercoaster. For this reason, many entrepreneurs are interested in understanding resilience and its role in managing the ups and downs of business venturing. This research examines the relationship between resilience and fluctuations in affect by studying entrepreneurs over the course of two working weeks, as they confront a challenge in their venture. The results show that entrepreneurs who are more resilient also report smaller changes in affect day‐to‐day. This suggests that entrepreneurs looking to enact resilience may need to turn the emotional rollercoaster of entrepreneurship into a train ride.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present a novel methodology for the out-of-sample forecast of the equity premium. Our predictive slope coefficient is a conservative constant that has a lower bias than the zero slope employed by the historical average, but has the same variance. We demonstrate that, theoretically and empirically, our method dominates the historical average in forecast performance. Our methodology establishes a simple yet powerful paradigm for exploiting the real-time equity premium predictability derived from a predictor. Applications of our method reveal that many predictors can forecast the equity premium, and that parameter estimates in previous studies add value to out-of-sample forecasts.

    <title>Revisiting Board Independence Mandates: Evidence from Director Reclassifications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide causal evidence on the effects of mandated board independence. We compare firms that replace existing non-independent directors to firms that retain these directors by reclassifying them as independent. Reclassification eligibility, being largely predetermined, offers quasi-exogenous variation in compliance strategies. We show that firms required to replace insiders perform worse post-mandate, driven by increased operational costs and reduced labor efficiency. Boards of non-reclassifying firms retain fewer former employees and replace them with directors more likely to join monitoring-focused committees, emphasizing the shift from advising to monitoring. Overall, these findings suggest that firm-specific director expertise contributes materially to performance and is consistent with pre-mandate board compositions optimized to balance benefits of enhanced monitoring against costs of reduced advisory capacity. We rule out alternative explanations, including adjustment costs due to director turnover and co-option. Our study underscores the importance of allowing firms flexibility in governance structures and cautions against uniform mandates.</content>

    <title>Design and Analysis of Efficient Sequencing Policies for Linear Cold Storage Devices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article, we investigate the problem of sequencing data requests for linear devices, such as magnetic tapes, to minimize response time in cold-storage solutions for archival data. Tapes are the technology of choice for long-term storage due to their reliability, low costs, security, and significant energy savings. However, physical limitations on tape pose challenges to policy implementation, which must be scalable on low-power hardware. We provide a theoretical and numerical analysis of existing policies and introduce new ones, identifying cases where each is applicable and evaluating their theoretical performance in terms of the number of requested files. In particular, we show that the standard first-in, first-out (FIFO) policy can be arbitrarily inefficient and investigate novel constant-ratio approximations and polynomial-time procedures. If data on the frequency with which each file is accessed is available, we consider a dynamic programming procedure to minimize a stochastic variant of the problem, providing a constant-time approximation for arbitrary file requests. We also investigate a quality criterion based on makespan and explore online variants of the problem. Our numerical analysis, conducted on both synthetic and real-world data from an industry partner, offers insights into when each policy is most appropriate, identifying cases where the proposed algorithms significantly outperform traditional policies, like FIFO, in terms of average reading times. This study has managerial implications, as current data retrieval practices in data centers are often limited to traditional policies with unknown theoretical performance. Our methodological and numerical analysis provides evidence of the value in appropriately sequencing requests based on tape structure, guiding algorithm choice and highlighting underlying trade-offs in response times.</content>

    <title>Expedited Shipping to Meet a Target Service Level: Analytical Recommendations and Behavioral Biases</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Maintaining a high service level with customers involves a fundamental tradeoff between investing in inventory and investing in expediting the shipping of the additional units needed to achieve that service level. We use a multi-method approach to show how and when ordering decisions are influenced by different levels of expediting costs and target service levels. First, we derive a mathematical model that provides a closed-form solution to this tradeoff. Second, we run a behavioral study to show how increments in the expediting cost and the target service level impact buyers’ ordering behavior. Results show that ordering decisions are influenced mainly by the expediting cost. Our econometric estimations provide a generalization of the pull-to-center effect to a setting with expedited shipping. Moreover, we find that buyers adjust their orders only when facing a high target service level. To reduce the observed behavioral biases, we propose that managers can increase the salience of key performance metrics in the buyers’ decision-making process. We test for the role of salience with a second behavioral study and a behavioral model. Results show that the extent to which salient information helps improve buyers’ ordering decisions depends on the level of the expediting cost. Interestingly, our behavioral model highlights how ordering decisions improve not by eliminating people’s biases but by amplifying some of those biases. We contribute to the literature on expedited shipping and behavioral operations, and provide practical recommendations for how managers can improve ordering decisions.</content>

    <title>Quality, Necessity, or Accessibility? Impact of Dockless Bike Sharing on Ineffective Use of Medical Resources</title>
    <updated>2025-02-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, patients have increasing autonomy in medical decision-making. With great autonomy in selecting medical institutions, patients with low-risk diseases may opt for treatment in prestigious hospitals, which limits the access of patients with high-risk diseases to these hospitals. Moreover, due to limited medical knowledge and a fear of uncertainty regarding diseases, patients with greater medical autonomy may request various unnecessary medical tests to alleviate their health-related anxiety. This study takes a novel patients’ perspective to investigate how dockless bike sharing, which addresses the “last-mile problem” and improves geographical accessibility to medical institutions, affects two types of ineffective use of medical resources: disease-institution mismatch and overuse of medical tests. By introducing the concept of quality-accessibility trade-off in patients’ decision-making processes, we shed light on the psychological mechanism underlying the effect of dockless bike sharing on patients’ medical institution choices. We also introduce a new concept, perceived necessity of medical tests, to explain how dockless bike sharing reduces unnecessary medical tests. In Study 1, we designed a quasi-experiment and applied a difference-in-differences model based on real-world electronic health record data to show that dockless bike sharing increased the likelihood of patients choosing hospitals over clinics and decreased the number of unnecessary medical tests. In Studies 2a, 2b, 3a, and 3b, four randomized controlled experiments were employed to replicate the findings and reveal the underlying mechanisms. In sum, we found that dockless bike sharing acted as a “double-edged sword” in terms of its impact on exacerbating disease-institution mismatch and alleviating the overuse of medical tests. This study makes significant theoretical contributions to the Operations Management, sharing economy, and medical resource management literature. It also offers important managerial insights for governments, shared mobility platforms, and healthcare providers.</content>

    <title>Is In-Game Purchase a Guilty Pleasure? Negative Beliefs and Treatment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In-game purchases have become the dominant source of revenue for developers of digital games and are critical to the growth of the digital game industry. However, the distribution of in-game purchases among gamers is highly skewed, where a very small proportion of gamers, labeled “whales,” account for the majority of in-game purchases, and a massive proportion of non-whales spend a minuscule amount. In this study, we explore how to improve in-game purchases by examining gamers’ underlying beliefs. We postulate that compared to spending on other forms of entertainment, in-game purchases suffer from an unusual set of negative beliefs that work against such purchases. We conduct four consecutive studies related to the negative beliefs, propose an approach to mitigate their impact on in-game purchases, and explain the heterogeneous effects of the proposed approach. Specifically, in study 1, we demonstrate the existence of negative beliefs. In Study 2, we identify five key types of negative beliefs. In Study 3, we develop an approach to reduce the negativity of these beliefs and improve gamers’ positive attitudes toward in-game purchases. Lastly, in Study 4, we examine reasons behind heterogeneous results from Study 3 on different gaming platforms and using different revenue models, and design more tailored approaches to incentivize in-game purchases for pay-to-play games and gamers on console platforms. Collectively, the findings in this paper reveal a set of overlooked factors that hinder in-game purchases and introduce a low-cost, effective technique that has the potential to influence gamers’ spending behaviors. Our findings extend beyond a single-game genre or platform and offer potential benefits to the entire digital game industry.</content>

    <title>From Social to Purchase: Customer Selection in Social Group Buying</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social scope group buying has emerged as an increasingly popular promotional strategy and has served as a new customer acquisition tool. In the service industry, companies use social group buying (SGB) to recruit new customers and promote full-price products. Through SGB activities, customers can trade their social capital to form buying groups, experience SGB-offered sample products, and further alleviate uncertainty regarding expensive full-price products before making a final purchase. We investigate this novel SGB phenomenon by examining customers’ decisions throughout the “experience-conversion” process. In collaboration with a leading online educational platform, we examine customers’ grouping behavior during SGB activities and analyze their subsequent purchases. Our analysis reveals an interesting pattern in which non-grouped customers have a higher proportion of full-price product purchases than grouped customers. We postulate that, in addition to observations from operational data, unobserved social information is important for gaining a deeper understanding of the customer behaviors underlying this pattern. Employing a Bayesian learning framework, we model customers’ three-stage discrete-choice decision-making processes and quantify two influential social information factors: social cost and social learning. By incorporating social information, our Bayesian learning model demonstrates improved effectiveness in assisting companies with accurately predicting final purchases in the conversion process. We provide actionable insights into how companies can employ our model to strategically tailor SGB designs by customer segments to increase overall purchase rates. Our study sheds light on the significance of social information in enhancing customer management and refining SGB design.</content>

    <title>Translating Empirical State-Dependent Service Times Into Queueing Models</title>
    <updated>2025-02-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent empirical studies suggest that human behavior in queues causes workload-dependent service times. We investigate the translation of empirical service times into state-dependent queueing models. To this end, we identify two types of state-dependent models, static and dynamic, and two types of corresponding behavioral mechanisms. For example, we view customer early task initiation as a static mechanism and social speedup pressure as a dynamic mechanism. For each model type, we discuss behavioral mechanisms consistent with the model assumptions and indicate how empirical service times can be translated into model input parameters. We illustrate how translating service times into dynamic models can result in invalid service rates, which provides evidence against dynamic mechanisms. For dynamic models, we find that mean service times are in general not the inverse of service rates, the directional change in service rates is not always the opposite of the directional change in mean service times, and workload measurement timing can drastically impact mean service time patterns. We provide closed-form equations to convert service times into service rates and vice versa, and find conditions under which monotonic mean service times imply monotonic service rates and vice versa. Our results provide guidelines for researchers to select and specify an appropriate state-dependent queueing model from service time data, and expand the scope of previously published analytical results.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article provides a comprehensive overview of the advancements and applications of operations research (OR) and management science (MS) in inventory management described by the Franz Edelman Award finalists from 1985 to 2023. The research presents the transformative potential of OR/MS in addressing complex inventory management challenges across various industries. Through an in-depth examination of the methodologies and solutions employed by these studies, we highlight the strategic implementations of several OR/MS techniques, including simulation-optimization, deep learning and advanced forecasting, dynamic pricing and yield management, and stochastic modeling. The analysis reveals the tangible benefits realized, such as optimized inventory levels, reduced costs, improved profits and revenue, and improved customer satisfaction. This research underscores the critical role of inventory process optimization and risk mitigation in navigating uncertainties and demand fluctuations. The managerial insights derived from these initiatives provide a roadmap for practitioners seeking to implement advanced OR/MS methodologies in real-world inventory management. The findings also encourage the adoption of innovative methods to enhance the operational efficiency and competitiveness. Through this exploration, we aim to stimulate further innovation and research in the evolving field of inventory management and to celebrate the achievements in applied analytics brought forth by the Franz Edelman Award finalists.</content>

    <title>When Platforms Go Public, Standards Drop</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms facilitate the direct exchange of goods, services, or financial transactions between individuals without the involvement of intermediaries. To maintain trust among their user bases, these platforms must implement stringent access controls to determine which users are eligible to participate in their digital marketplace. We argue that when a platform transitions from private to public ownership, it may be incentivized to strategically lower its access standards and admit users who might otherwise have been deemed unqualified. Lowering standards before an initial public offering (IPO) can enable platforms to rapidly increase their user base—and, consequently, enhance their perceived valuation—which could appeal to stock investors and positively influence the IPO price. While this strategy may bolster short-term growth, it could be costly to the platform’s user base. We support this hypothesis using data from two major P2P lending platforms—one that went public and one that remained private. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, we find that the platform preparing for an IPO admitted borrowers who exhibited higher risk levels. Additionally, lenders, in some cases, did not effectively screen out these subpar borrowers and ended up issuing loans to them, leading to higher default rates and lower returns for the lenders. This effect was particularly evident for a specific segment of lenders—namely, those who brokered small-valued loans and loans for necessary purchases (e.g., health emergencies). By contrast, lenders who screened for large-valued loans or loans for discretionary expenditures (e.g., vacations or weddings) were more successful in screening out these subpar borrowers and not issuing loans to them. These results fill a gap in the operations management literature on platform governance by integrating capital-raising objectives into the discussion of access control and operational screening. Our study highlights the nuanced trade-off between quality control and user expansion during capital-raising events, emphasizing both the opportunities and potential inefficiencies that arise in this context.</content>

    <title>Impact of Industrial and Geographical Concentrations of Upstream Industries on Firm Performance During COVID-19</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a large sample of supplier–firm relationships, we develop new measures to operationalize the industrial and geographical concentrations of firms’ upstream industries. The developed measures show an upstream industry might be competitive and contain many suppliers (low industrial concentration) and yet be concentrated in a few countries (high geopolitical concentration) or a small geographical area (high geographical concentration), thus leaving the downstream firm vulnerable to geographical or geopolitical disruptions. Using COVID-19 as an exogenous shock, we document that the firms whose upstream suppliers are operating in industries that have high concentration (either geographically or geopolitically), on average, experienced a reduction of 250 million US dollars in quarterly sales. Thus, competitive industries with ample suppliers may still impose significant risks on downstream firms if the upstream suppliers’ industries are concentrated mainly in a few countries or small geographical areas. Noteworthy, we find evidence that the link between upstream suppliers’ industry-level concentrations and downstream firms’ sales growth is heterogeneous. Specifically, firms can mitigate the negative relationship by adjusting their supply chain networks. The negative relationship is weaker for firms with a geopolitically diversified supply base and firms with more domestic suppliers. Our estimates are robust and consistently identified through several different empirical strategies. Our findings help policymakers and managers to systematically identify locations in supply networks that have the potential to create bottlenecks that may even threaten national security. Additionally, the proposed measures give policymakers insights into which industries to support for onshoring.</content>

    <title>Revisiting Seller Reputation: Impact of Internal and External Reputation on Sales in Online Knowledge Payment Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The emergence of the sharing economy has catalyzed the proliferation of online knowledge payment platforms, empowering individuals possessing untapped knowledge to engage as sellers. Within this landscape, reputation plays a pivotal role in shaping the sales dynamics of knowledge products, which are categorized as credence goods. Unlike conventional sellers, who typically focus on internal reputation-building efforts, knowledge providers have the opportunity to cultivate an external reputation through their professional contributions beyond the platform, potentially influencing sales within it. However, the relative impact of internal and external reputation on driving sales remains uncertain. Our study addresses this gap by investigating the influence of a knowledge provider's internal and external reputation on sales across two phases of live knowledge-sharing lectures—pre and post-live broadcast—using data obtained from a prominent online knowledge payment platform. Our findings reveal that both internal and external reputation positively impact sales during both phases. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the type of product moderates the effect of reputation on sales, with internal reputation exerting a greater influence on sales of hedonic products, while external reputation has a stronger effect on sales of utilitarian products. These discoveries contribute to technology operations management by providing theoretical insights into the formulation and implementation of innovative strategies aimed at enhancing the sales performance of knowledge-based products. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating distinct reputation-building approaches into the design of reputation systems, thereby charting a course toward achieving successful product sales in the realm of online knowledge payment platforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As data breaches become an increasingly common risk, they are now a matter of “when” rather than “if.” While there has been active research on breaches, much of the work has focused on the antecedents and prevention of breaches, leaving the quantitative ramifications and variations in breach impact relatively unexplored. To address this gap, our study quantifies the impact of breaches on operational performance and identifies how operational, technological, and market factors moderate the impact. Using a quasi-experimental design with a difference-in-differences technique and propensity score matching, we analyzed a matched sample of 1,766 US hospitals, consisting of 883 breached hospitals and their non-breached peers from 2010 to 2017. We find that breached hospitals experience a 2.1% reduction in hospital admissions and a 0.28% decrease in market share. Moreover, network affiliation, decentralized governance, and cloud-based information technology services negatively moderate breach impacts, while IT security systems for detection, identity governance, and recovery provide mitigating effects. Additionally, we find that breaches in one hospital spillover to affect non-breached hospitals in the same local market. Our findings contribute to the operations management and security literature and provide managerial insights for enhancing breach resilience. Understanding these moderating factors can help hospital managers and policymakers formulate tailored mitigation strategies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Retail store employees are increasingly being asked to pick orders from inventory. These tasks are performed under intense conditions and are often made more difficult because of high product variety and high degrees of product similarity. We conduct a real-effort task in a virtual environment where subjects must sort cubes into bins. We study task complexity by varying the degree of similarity between the cubes and task intensity by varying the arrival rate of the cube. We focus on four performance metrics: Throughput (number of cubes sorted per minute), Accuracy (percentage of correctly sorted cubes), Productivity (number of correctly sorted cubes per minute), and Error Rate (number of incorrectly sorted cubes per minute). Reducing task complexity increases productivity by as much as 38.2%, and the error rate falls by as much as 93.6%. It also leads to more efficient movements, according to a detailed analysis of our subjects' motion. Increasing task intensity improves throughput but decreases accuracy slightly while varying task intensity improves performance via faster learning. We also observe that subjects tend to cut corners when the task is more complex or more intense.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Choosing the right development team is crucial for companies. We investigate how project collaboration requirements and uncertainty levels affect the choice between “specialists” with higher levels of task-specific abilities and “generalists” with higher levels of collaboration skills. We also examine how these factors affect optimal team incentives. In addition to performance-enhancing helping, we consider another type of collaboration that has received less attention in the incentive literature: information-sharing, which can reduce uncertainty and lead to more compatible design decisions. In the case of helping, we show that if uncertainty is high then specialists might be preferred in order to reduce risk exposure—even if their task-specific abilities are only slightly better. Conversely, if information-sharing can significantly reduce uncertainty then generalists may be favored even if their task-specific abilities are much lower. Our study also reveals that task and collaboration incentives can be either complements or substitutes depending on the type of collaboration and level of project uncertainty: in projects that benefit from helping, firms will always substitute task incentives for collaboration incentives when selecting a team of specialists (rather than a team of generalists), yet this need not be the case with information-sharing. In such projects, it can be optimal to offer higher task incentives and also higher collaboration incentives to a team of specialists (than to a team of generalists) even though specialists’ collaboration skills are relatively lower.</content>

    <title>Equitable Workload Allocation in Vehicle Routing Problem With Heterogeneous Drivers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the private logistics service sector, considerations of fairness among service agents are relatively new but are gaining importance due to public and governmental pressures to improve equity in workload allocation among internal stakeholders, such as the service personnel. Fairness becomes more complex in settings with a heterogeneous workforce due to inherent worker differences. In this study, we present an equitable workload allocation model for the vehicle routing problem with heterogeneous drivers. We adopt the Nash Social Welfare (NSW) solution as the focal point for coalition among the various drivers. In our setup, while the ultimate goal is to maximize the equity and efficiency of drivers, the company’s efficiency is guaranteed by putting a cap on the deviation of the company’s cost from the least-cost solution value. We formulate the problem of last-mile delivery of online orders from a store using a fleet of crowdshippers as a variant of the vehicle routing problem with a highly nonlinear objective function inspired by NSW’s objective function. To solve the proposed new formulation, a column generation method is developed and used to study the behavior of the model. Through a comprehensive computational study, we investigate the behavior of the system in terms of the company’s cost, drivers’ total profit, and the level of achieved equity among the drivers when the main parameters of the problem vary. Our study demonstrates that the proposed framework outperforms the classical max–min approach in balancing workload equity and efficiency. We show a median equity improvement of 18% with a 5% cost deviation and 30% with a 10% deviation from the least-cost solution.</content>

    <title>Two Heads Are Better than One: Task Division and Decision Control in Inventory Planning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine when and how task division improves performance for inventory planning. Specifically, we consider a decentralized inventory management context with two interdependent subtasks: preparing a forecast and setting a service level. Using a behavioral experiment, we reveal that the task challenge moderates the relationship between task division and performance. Our findings indicate that task division improves performance when the task becomes more challenging, such as under high demand uncertainty. It facilitates counteracting behavior, where individuals adjust their decisions to counterbalance their partner's errors, leading to more stabilized final decisions. We identify this counteracting behavior as a critical mechanism driving the benefits of task division, mainly when subtasks are interdependent. We demonstrate the robustness of our findings by examining an egalitarian system, where decision-making authority is shared among team members, and a hierarchical system, where decision control resides entirely with one team member.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite recent theorizing on the power of rhetorical histories, scholars have yet to consider the dynamics of organizational generations (i.e., collectives defined by temporally proximal organizational entry and shared experiences and memories of organizational events) involved in their creation and long-term effects. Based on a comparative case study of two union organizations that participated in failed initiatives, we produce a parallel process model of cross-generational historical branching explaining the divergent and long-term influences of using history strategically across generational lines. Our model unpacks how theoretically distinct forms of what has been deemed “historical myth” offered by senior generations, while harboring similar utility in building cross-generational support, underlie divergent outcomes regarding how members across generations respond to subsequent failure and, in turn, historically position the initiative. We further suggest these processes have a lingering impact on an organization’s willingness to engage in a subsequent initiative. Our theory sheds light on the ways in which historical myths shared across generational divides, in tandem with the cross-generational mnemonic communities they create, engender divergent, long-term, and potentially unexpected consequences.Funding: This work was supported by Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and National Research Foundation of Korea [Grant NRF-2020S1A5A8042404], the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [KAKENHI Grant JP16K17159], and the Yonsei Signature Research Cluster Program [Grant 2024-22-0167].</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Chance constraints, under either known or ambiguous distributions, yield nonconvex feasible regions in general. This paper identifies sufficient conditions that lead to convex feasible regions of chance constraints with Wasserstein ambiguity. Notably, it generalizes the seminal work of other authors, which established the convexity of joint chance constraints under log-concave probability distributions, to the distributionally robust and distributionally optimistic settings.</content>

    <title>A Structural Model of a Firm’s Operating Cash Flow with Applications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Effective management of a firm’s operating cash flow is essential for supporting growth, servicing debt, and maintaining overall financial health. Mismanagement of cash flows can result in severe liquidity challenges and even business failure. However, managing operating cash flow is complex because of its intricate, endogenous relationships with operational variables, like sales, operating costs, inventory, payables, and the impact of exogenous macroeconomic factors on a firm. In this paper, we present a structural model of operating cash flow that untangles this endogeneity, allows us to estimate causal relationships among these variables, and provides a valuable tool for evaluating cash flow management policies. Applying our model to quarterly financial data from S&amp;P’s Compustat database spanning from 1990 to 2020 along with macroeconomic indicators, we provide empirical evidence of the endogenous nature of cash flow with other operational variables. We then showcase the practical value of our model by (i) identifying the characteristics of structural shocks and the new equilibria they induce within the system; (ii) offering a tool for evaluating alternative managerial actions or policy decisions to counteract these shocks; (iii) predicting the impacts of macroeconomic events, such as global recessions and fluctuations in economic sentiment, on firm performance; and (iv) demonstrating superior forecasting performance compared with traditional univariate models. In summary, our structural model of operating cash flow enhances our understanding of its dynamics, enabling better-informed decision making and more effective cash flow management in firms.This paper was accepted by David Simchi Levi, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03790 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a framework for the fundamental valuation of utility tokens. We introduce a requirement that is reminiscent of the cash-in-advance constraint, stipulating that services have to be accessed immediately. Our model endogenizes the velocity of token circulation, yielding a microfounded pricing formula that we calibrate using Ethereum’s adoption data. The equilibrium price path goes through two successive phases: initially, a portion of the tokens are held for purely speculative motives, and later on, all tokens are held with the intention of being used.This paper has been This paper was accepted by Will Cong for the Special Issue on Digital Finance.Funding: This project has benefited from the financial support of the academic chair Blockchain@Polytechnique.

    <title>Long Lags and Large Returns: Experimental Evidence from Advertising to Businesses</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a multiyear experiment, we show that advertising to businesses can generate very different responses than has been observed for consumers. First, we estimate larger advertising returns than typically found for consumers: a return on ad spend of 12.0 (95% CI: 4.8–24.5). Second, we estimate longer lags between ad delivery and purchase: 1–5 months for first-time purchases and 5–12 months or longer for repeat purchases. Third, we find that existing business customers are responsible for most of the revenue lift from advertising, though this appears to be driven by existing business customers purchasing new parts. Additionally, our results demonstrate that geography-based switchback experiments that randomize the time between treatments can provide an effective means of estimating lagged effects. For this study we randomized the delivery of digital display ads for electronic components offered by a semiconductor manufacturer; nearly all electronic products require such components.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Funding: M.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper introduces source theory, a new theory for decision under ambiguity (unknown probabilities). It shows how Savage’s subjective probabilities, with source-dependent nonlinear weighting functions, can model Ellsberg’s ambiguity. It can do so in Savage’s framework of state-contingent assets, permits nonexpected utility for risk, and avoids multistage complications. It is tractable, shows ambiguity attitudes through simple graphs, is empirically realistic, and can be used prescriptively. We provide a new tool to analyze weighting functions: pmatchers. They give Arrow–Pratt-like transformations but operate “within” rather than “outside” functions. We further show that ambiguity perception and inverse S probability weighting, seemingly unrelated concepts, are two sides of the same “insensitivity” coin.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: H.

    <title>EXPRESS: The Slang Paradox: Connecting or Disconnecting with Consumers?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many brands use slang in their marketing communications to connect with consumers. However, through analyses of two Twitter datasets and four experiments, we find that the use of slang in marketing communications could have unintended negative consequences for brands. We theorize and demonstrate that slang use in marketing communications can be perceived as inauthentic because such messages violate consumer expectations, leading to less favorable brand perceptions. To refine our understanding, we test conditions under which slang use aligns more with consumer expectations and is therefore perceived as less inauthentic. Specifically, we find that source characteristics play an important role. First, we show that brand personality impacts this process: Consumers have less favorable attitudes when sincere brands use slang, but not when exciting brands use slang. Second, when influencers (instead of brands themselves) publish brand messages, the negative effect of slang disappears. In addition to contributing new theoretical insights, this research provides practical guidance on effective social media engagement strategies by identifying conditions when slang use is perceived as inappropriate or not in marketing communications.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It has long been a mantra of marketing practice that, particularly in low-involvement situations, spokespeople should be physically attractive. This paper suggests there is a higher probability of gaining fame and influence (i.e., celebrity potential) than is captured by attractiveness or typicality. The authors identify 11 facial features that may predict celebrity potential by virtue of their purported relationship with charisma and resulting personality trait inferences. Using machine learning methods and a sample of 22,000 faces, the authors calculate the direction and strength of the correlation of each feature with celebrity potential. The model is 95.92% accurate in predicting whether a given face belongs to a celebrity or noncelebrity, and it allows calculating a celebrity visual potential (CVP) metric for any face. Two controlled experiments and two studies using photographs of faces of Instagram and LinkedIn users further validate that the model-generated CVP is consistent with human-rated CVP, showing predictive power above and beyond facial typicality and averageness. This paper challenges prior assumptions about the importance of attractiveness in spokesperson choice, offers a useful additional metric for marketers, and provides novel insights about the relative importance of various inferred personality traits for celebrity potential.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The vast amount of content on social media platforms makes it extremely challenging to get posts noticed. An increasingly popular approach to increase customer engagement relies on text overlays, where text is placed directly on images. Such practices raise questions of how to balance the visual and text elements for the best impact. Three key factors, commonly used by practitioners, can trigger engagement because of their visual salience: the degree of dynamism or implied motion in images as well as the size and centrality of the text overlay. With multiple methods, including field studies, online experiments, and managerial interviews, the authors establish that a text overlay that is too large and placed centrally, combined with dynamic images, has negative effects on consumer engagement, because these design combinations make the post look visually unappealing. They also leverage these findings to develop an interactive app that can help managers compose more engaging multimodal social media posts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With infeed advertising becoming an increasingly popular advertising tool for advertisers to reach mobile consumers, the authors propose an integrated model of contemporaneous, carryover, and spillover effects to measure the incremental contributions of infeed ads in multiple types of mobile apps: newsfeed, social, and video. They empirically examine the three proposed effects of newsfeed ads, social feed ads, and video feed ads using data from a large-scale ad campaign for a new mobile game. The data set contains 10,115,801 impressions, 286,506 clicks, and 12,706 conversions. First, the findings show that social feed ads have the strongest contemporaneous effects on both ad clicks and conversions; social feed ads are 1.87 times more likely to generate a click and 1.69 times more likely to generate a conversion than newsfeed ads, followed by video feed ads (clicks: 1.73 times; conversions: 1.55 times). Second, video feed ads have the strongest carryover effect, followed by social feed ads, while newsfeed ads have a negative carryover effect. Third, newsfeed ads exhibit the strongest spillover effect; prior newsfeed ad exposures are more effective than prior social or video feed ad exposures at promoting clicks and conversions upon subsequent exposure in other channels.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We aim to stimulate discussion on how innovation research within marketing can use a better world (BW) perspective to help innovation become a driver of positive change in the world. In this “Challenging the Boundaries” series paper, we hope to provide purposeful research opportunities for scholars seeking to bridge innovation research with the BW movement. We frame our discussion with four areas of innovation research in marketing that are particularly relevant to BW objectives. We discuss how the innovation process may be disrupted by potentially relinquishing customer centricity and embracing the constraints imposed by BW objectives. We explore how firms should organize for BW innovation, both in terms of who should be involved in the process internally and externally, and how the workforce and firm should be structured to support BW innovation. We then consider consumer response to innovation from a BW perspective, examining drivers of adoption behavior regarding BW innovations and how these innovations should be marketed. We also explore post-adoption behavior, as well as helping consumers resist adoption in certain contexts. Finally, we discuss how markets for BW innovation may be created and sustained, and how external constituencies (i.e., government, lawmakers, and academic communities) could shape these markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Climate change adaptation has for a long time been the neglected half of the climate equation, as most attention has been directed toward mitigation. Yet, the catastrophic effects of a changing climate are already occurring, unavoidable, and in many cases irreversible. Organizations need to identify ways of adapting to present and future climatic conditions. In this editorial, we make the case for climate change adaptation as a research topic on par with mitigation. We outline how and why management and organizational scholarship should work toward an integrated approach of mitigation and adaptation in responding to climate change, suggesting three key avenues of research for future inquiry. In so doing, we encourage more impactful and ecologically relevant management research that will make a difference to society at large.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Socioeconomic status (SES)—one’s objective economic and social standing—has the potential to yield critical implications for employee well-being. Despite the vast multidisciplinary literature on the topic, management scholars have historically treated SES as a control variable and have only recently begun to critically examine the role of SES at work. Because of this, relatively little is known about the role that work-specific factors play in the relationship between SES and employee well-being, as well as the role of the socio-environmental context (i.e., understanding who is more vulnerable to health inequalities due to demographics or the environmental contexts in which they operate). To integrate the study of SES more fully into management theory and research, we draw on resource-based theories to develop an organizing framework for reviewing and synthesizing the vast literature on this topic that spans multiple disciplines. In so doing, we unpack the dynamic and reciprocal relationship between SES and employee well-being, elucidating the role that work-specific mechanisms (i.e., job demands and resources) play in linking SES to well-being (and vice versa) and clarifying how these have the potential to amplify or attenuate the effects of SES on well-being. Further, we provide evidence for the role of the socio-environmental context in affecting the aforementioned relationships. We conclude with a critique of the literature, highlighting methodological limitations and opportunities for future research. Ultimately, our hope is for research in management and applied psychology to regard SES not merely as a nuisance variable, but as a subject meriting dedicated inquiry.</content>

    <title>Competitive overlap as a signal in expert partner choice: Evidence from patent law firm selection</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In market networks, firms regularly seek partners with needed expertise, but these partners often work with the firms' competitors. How such second‐order competitive overlap affects partner selection is unclear. Prior theory assumes firms view networks as “pipes” and emphasizes flows of competitor information via the shared partner as key in partner selection. We propose that firms also view networks as “prisms” and use competitive overlap as a signal of a potential partner's expertise. Hence, firms may prefer partners with competitive overlap. We find support for our claims in the patent law firm selection context. Furthermore, higher competitive overlap leads to slower patent acceptance but results in broader patents, implying that the competitive overlap expertise signal reduces search costs without significant performance loss.Managerial SummaryWhen selecting expert partners like law firms or consultants, some companies may consider avoiding firms that also serve their competitor. However, when little is known about potential partners, this “competitive overlap” might be a way to assess their quality. We found that firms are more likely to choose patent law firms who work with their competitors. This occurs because a competitor's choice signals that partner's expertise. Companies rely on this signal most when they lack direct experience with potential partners or when entering new technological domains. While working with partners who serve competitors might slightly increase processing times, it can increase patent protection without compromising overall performance. These findings suggest that avoiding partners based solely on competitive overlap may limit access to valuable expertise.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the effects of the largest residential racial desegregation initiative in U.S. history, the Gautreaux Assisted Housing Program. From the late 1970s to the 1990s, Gautreaux moved thousands of Black families into predominantly white neighborhoods to support racial and economic integration. We link historical program records to administrative data and use plausibly exogenous variation in neighborhood placements to study how desegregating moves impact children in the long-run. Being placed in the predominantly white neighborhoods targeted by the program significantly increases children’s future lifetime earnings and wealth. These moves also increase the likelihood of marriage and particularly raise the probability of being married to a white spouse. Moreover, placements through Gautreaux impact neighborhood choices in adulthood. Those placed in predominantly white neighborhoods during childhood live in more racially diverse areas with higher rates of upward mobility nearly 40 years later.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We exploit within-firm variations in plant-level toxic releases to examine the effect of managerial hometown preference on corporate environmental policies. We find that pollution levels are about 30% lower for plants located near chief executive officers’ (CEOs’) hometowns. This reduction is achieved through resource-intensive pollution control efforts, including source reduction and waste management activities. Analyses using CEO turnover provide causal inferences. Local residents benefit from CEO hometown pollution reduction as localities hosting more hometown plants experience improved environmental conditions and better residential health outcomes. On the other hand, some evidence suggests that CEOs’ hometown preference is related to agency frictions. Overall, our findings reveal the impact of CEOs’ personal motivations on corporate pollution dynamics and their consequential effects on the well-being of local communities.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: Q.

    <title>City Digitalization and Corporate Financial Fraud: An Information Asymmetry Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One pivotal driver of corporate financial fraud is the information asymmetry between cooperative executives and external stakeholders. We propose that city‐level digitalization can mitigate such information asymmetry and deter financial fraud of local firms. Using panel data from listed firms and archival data in China, we find that city digitalization is negatively associated with the incidence of corporate financial fraud. However, this association is weaker in regions with high bureaucratic corruption but is stronger for firms with low corporate social responsibility scores. Further mediating analyses show that city digitalization reduces information asymmetry between local firms and the market and in turn decreases financial fraud incidence. Overall, our research sheds novel light on the governance role of city digitalization and highlights the significance of complementarity between various governance components.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show a negative effect of opioid prescriptions on subsequent individual employment among employers in our sample using doctor-opioid-prescribing propensity as our instrument. This finding has implications for firms that must now contend with lower local labor supply. We find a negative relationship between opioid prescriptions and subsequent establishment growth. However, firms respond to labor shortages by investing more in technology, replacing the relatively scarcer labor with capital, especially when they are not financially constrained. We find positive abnormal returns, upon the passage of state laws intended to limit opioid prescriptions, that are driven by firms more reliant on labor. (JEL J21, G31, 033)</content>

    <title>Are U.S. GAAP-based and IFRS-based accounting amounts more comparable after the revised lease standards? Evidence from ASC 842 and IFRS 16</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines whether the revised lease standards (ASC 842 and IFRS 16) make U.S. GAAP-based accounting amounts more comparable with IFRS-based accounting amounts. Our study is motivated by the FASB and the IASB’s call for research on the comparability of the revised lease standards. We find that U.S. GAAP and IFRS pairs that are high operating lease users experience a larger increase in accounting comparability after the adoption of revised lease standards than low operating lease U.S. GAAP-IFRS pairs. Additionally, our results suggest that the improvement comes more from the changes to the balance sheet rather than the income statement and is more pronounced for IFRS firms from countries with stronger accounting enforcement. Lastly, we show that analysts who are more GAAP-focused (IFRS-focused) prior to the standard change are more likely to increase their forecasting of book value per share for IFRS (U.S. GAAP) firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Rapid technological developments in online markets fundamentally change the relationship between consumers and sellers. Online platforms can easily gather data about consumers’ search behavior, allowing for price discrimination. Therefore, product search becomes a strategic choice. Consumers face a tradeoff: Search intensely and receive a better fit at a potentially higher price or restrict search behavior, be strategically inattentive, and receive a worse fit but maybe a better deal. We study the resulting strategic buyer-seller interaction theoretically and experimentally. Our experimental results shed a critical light on the added value for consumers through the rise of online platforms and on the effectiveness of current regulations.This paper has been This paper was accepted by Elena Katok for the Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: This work was supported by the ZEW–Leibniz-Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung, and the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03413 .</content>

    <title>The Effect of On-the-Job Experience on Base-Rate Neglect: Evidence from Medical Professionals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effect of on-the-job experience on base-rate neglect, which is a common bias in assessing conditional probabilities. We do so by carrying out experiments with medical professionals, who are routinely exposed to conditional-probability problems in the form of diagnostic tests, and nonmedical professionals, who are not. As such, medical workers with more years of experience will have had more exposure to base-rate type problems than nonmedical workers with similar years of experience. We estimate the effect of on-the-job experience by comparing the answers of more or less experienced professionals in both the medical and nonmedical domains. Although the incidence of the bias is high for both groups and all levels of experience, we find that more experienced medical workers (a) have lower rates of perfect base-rate neglect (i.e., completely ignoring the base rates), (b) provide more accurate posterior estimates, and (c) adjust their estimates more in response to changes in the base rates. We observe no such difference for nonmedical workers. We conduct a number of robustness checks and consider possible mechanisms, such as education, job or survey attrition, selectivity into medical professions, and experience with false positives. Our results suggests that on-the-job experience mitigates, but does not eliminate, base-rate neglect.This paper was accepted by Lauren Cohen, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Lehigh University [FRG Grant].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05461 .</content>

    <title>All the Lonely People: An Integrated Review and Research Agenda on Work and Loneliness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Decades of studies spanning multiple disciplines have provided insight into the critical role of loneliness in work contexts. In spite of this extensive research, a comprehensive review of loneliness and work remains absent. To address this gap, we conducted a multidisciplinary review of relevant theory and research and identified 213 articles reporting on 233 empirical studies from management, organizational psychology, sociology, medicine, and other domains to uncover why people feel lonely, how different features of work can contribute to feelings of loneliness, and the implications of employee loneliness for organizational settings. This enabled a critical examination of the distinct conceptualizations and operationalizations of loneliness that have been advanced and the theories underpinning this scholarship. We developed a comprehensive conceptual model that integrates cognitive discrepancy theory, the affect theory of social exchange, and evolutionary theory. This model elucidates the core antecedents, mediators, outcomes, moderators, and interventions forming the nomological network of work related loneliness, including cross-level influences within teams and among leaders. Our review also identifies a number of promising areas for future inquiry to improve our understanding and measurement of loneliness, the process of experiencing and managing loneliness in the workplace, and potential interventions to reduce it. Finally, we provide tangible guidance for organizations and practitioners on how to address and mitigate employee loneliness. Ultimately, our review underscores the complex nature of loneliness and work and establishes a foundation for advancing both scholarly discourse and organizational practices in this critical domain.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online education is a vital consumer industry that is undergoing rapid technological change. This paper develops a deep learning model to predict instructor performance on online education platforms from a content-based perspective. Specifically, we design an interpretable hierarchical transformer with contextual attention to predict instructor rating and course rating using textual data. Our model captures the inherent hierarchical structure of online courses and the sequential dependency of lectures within a course. Moreover, it goes beyond prediction and enables interpretability analysis, which provides additional insights into potential reasons behind the predictions made by the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms classic machine learning models as well as state-of-the-art deep learning models. Furthermore, we conduct in-depth interpretability analysis to explore what factors might predict the success of an online course at the lecture, sentence, and word level. We also showcase the value and applicability of our model through a randomized experiment. Our findings and methods provide managerial implications for instructors and online education platforms to improve course creation and delivery in this vitally important emerging market.</content>

One reason shoppers abandon their carts is because they don’t feel their decision to buy is final. Our study focuses on interface interventions that can help make decisions feel final. By drawing upon theories about why people feel uneasy with their choices, we examine how these interface interventions can ease negative feelings and help people commit to their decisions and complete their purchase. We conducted a series of controlled experiments to test interface interventions that provide users with direct support (i.e., coupons) and social support (i.e., social endorsements) for their choices. Our findings show that these interventions help reduce negative feelings and make decisions feel more final (i.e., a sense of choice closure), ultimately leading to greater customer satisfaction with their decisions.</content>

    <title>What Does Not Kill You Makes You Search: The Effects of Failure Threat and Self-Evaluation on Entrepreneurs’ Ego Networks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social network theory suggests that social networks, particularly diverse ones, are crucial for entrepreneurial resource acquisition and success. However, previous research has found that entrepreneurs do not necessarily develop diverse networks but tend to associate with similar others and develop closed networks. Building on problemistic search theory and perceptual control theory, we propose that as developing diverse networks consumes cognitive and time resources, entrepreneurs are more likely to do so when they face failure threats and do not evaluate themselves as able to address the threats. An experiment with 155 entrepreneurs in China found that failure threat increases entrepreneurs’ network diversity and that this effect is attenuated by self-affirmation. A longitudinal survey of 153 entrepreneurs in China showed that entrepreneurs whose self-worth is contingent upon business success develop social networks rich in structural holes in the short term and dense networks in the long term, and these effects are attenuated by entrepreneurial self-efficacy. These findings highlight the motivational and cognitive factors driving entrepreneurs’ social networks and contribute to social network theory, problemistic search theory, and perceptual control theory.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates whether male and female entrepreneurs exhibit systematic differences in the customer learning actions they pursue, and how those actions convert to venture performance. Drawing from a dyadic sample of founders and startup advisors in the high-technology context, we explore the effects of two alternative customer learning actions—customer involvement as an information source (CIS) and customer involvement as co-developers (CIC). We find that, compared to male entrepreneurs, female entrepreneurs engage in higher levels of both types of customer learning actions (CIS and CIC). Contrary to research from the large established firm context, we find CIS and CIC have conflicting startup performance implications—CIS is beneficial, but CIC is detrimental.</content>

    <title>How the Interplay Between Algorithmic &lt;scp&gt;HRM&lt;/scp&gt; Systems Promotes Gig Workers' Self‐Efficacy: The Role of Technostressors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The increasingly crucial algorithmic Human Resource Management (HRM) field is spawning two research streams: Algorithmic monitoring and algorithmic control. Yet, the conceptual differences and interplay between them have been largely confused and ignored in research and practice. This study clarifies their conceptual differences by exploring their interplay effect on gig workers' technostressors. Based on the stress and coping theory, a partial least squares structural equation modeling analysis by running data from 407 gig workers participating in a three‐wave time‐lagged survey was conducted. Results show that observational or interactional algorithmic monitoring hinders or promotes gig workers' self‐efficacy via both challenge and threat technostressors, respectively. While enhancing the positive effect of interactional algorithmic monitoring on self‐efficacy via threat technostressors, guiding algorithmic control attenuates the negative effect of observational algorithmic monitoring on self‐efficacy via challenge and threat technostressors, which contrasts with prior algorithmic HRM literature considering algorithmic control as a universally “bad thing” by workers. These findings deepen the understanding of the algorithmic HRM realm by revealing the differences and interplay between algorithmic monitoring and algorithmic control. Operators should differentiate and synergize control and monitoring functions by emphasizing outcomes that the interplay between algorithmic HRM systems has on the workforce.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The impact of political connections on firm innovation remains unclear. Utilizing the unexpected removal of high‐ranking officials during China's anti‐corruption campaigns between 1999 and 2015 as an exogenous shock, we analyze this relationship to provide greater clarity. Employing a difference‐in‐differences approach, we find that firms that experience unexpected loss of political connections file significantly more patent applications than those that do not experience such disruption. Further analyses indicate that this innovation boost is more pronounced for firms operating in highly competitive markets and those with substantial knowledge stocks. Our research therefore contributes novel empirical evidence to the discourse on political connections and firm innovation, highlighting the inhibitory effect of political connections and offering insights into the political economy of innovation.Managerial SummaryThis study explores the impact of anti‐corruption campaigns on the innovation efforts of firms with political connections in China. We discover that when such firms experience the unexpected loss of their political connections, they tend to file more patent applications, although this does not necessarily result in more patents being granted. It is important for firms and policymakers to understand that the response to such losses is not uniform. Firms are more likely to enhance their innovation efforts through increased patent applications if they are facing intense market competition or possess a rich knowledge stock. These findings underscore the importance of fostering a competitive market environment alongside anti‐corruption campaigns to stimulate innovation. Our study therefore sheds light on how to precisely assess the impact of anti‐corruption campaigns on firm behaviors and strategies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Populism is a political phenomenon that attempts to harness existing institutions for populist ends, often leading to negative consequences for businesses. However, can national institutions resist this pressure and mitigate the damage to firms? This paper investigates how populist electoral success influences corporate investment, unraveling the intricate connection between a country’s political institutions and the investment behavior of companies. Through the lens of political uncertainty and transaction cost economics, we theorize that countries with fortified checks and balances—facilitated by electoral systems (situated at the entrance to power), judicial independence (supervising the exercise of power), and government accountability (serving as ex-post checks)—effectively mitigate populist impulses. However, these checks and balances are also often targeted by populist leaders, as they prevent full implementation of a populist agenda. Analyzing a dataset spanning over 36,000 firms across 42 countries from 1995 to 2021, we find that existing checks and balances shield firms from populist excesses. In line with our theory, the longer a ruler is in power, the weaker these checks and balances remain. Our study highlights populism’s harm to business and the role of robust political institutions as mitigating factors.</content>

    <title>From Apathy to Allyship: Does Discrimination Awareness Received From Cross‐Race Friends Facilitate Racial Allyship at Work?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leveraging theories from the friendship, contact, and collective action literatures we examine the effects of a unique learning function of cross‐race friendships—discrimination awareness—on workplace allyship. Using field and experimental designs, we found that this function of cross‐race friendships creates a sense of moral outrage that motivates Whites to engage in and support allyship at work. This function predicted allyship behaviors and was resilient to ally risk, which reflects organizational sanctions for voicing concerns about racism. Robustness tests showed that other forms of interracial contact (positive/negative contact; residential, family, and work group diversity) had little effect on allyship and the effects of this friendship function held when we controlled for them. This function also contributed explanatory power beyond individual differences in race‐related ideologies and personality traits, such as social dominance orientation and beliefs in the malleability of prejudice. The relationship lens offered here brings new theoretical traction to the field of allyship and illustrates the potential of cross‐race friendships as sources of learning and agents for organizational change.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The choice between historical cost and fair value measurement is one of the most debated issues among accounting academics and practitioners. We use the election of the fair value option (FVO) to study the effects of entities’ measurement choices on accounting comparability. The FVO enables entities to use different measurement bases for similar assets and liabilities, raising questions about whether the FVO compromises or enhances comparability. Using a sample of US banks, we find that FVO elections increase comparability both across FVO electing banks and between FVO electing banks and banks that never elect the FVO but only if the FVO elections comply with the intent of the standard setters to remedy accounting mismatches. Overall our results suggest that banks elect the FVO to better present their economics, yielding higher comparability.</content>

    <title>The opportunity for partner industry knowledge sharing within audit offices and audit quality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conjecture that a greater opportunity for audit partners to share personal industry knowledge with each other within audit offices is associated with higher audit quality. Using Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Form AP data, we analyze each partner’s client portfolio and construct sharing measures. First, we find extant measures of an audit office’s industry market share, industry portfolio share, and industry diversity are quite noisy in inferring our sharing measures. Next, we perform multivariate analyses and find negative associations between the opportunity to share industry knowledge and both restatements and absolute abnormal accruals. Further, we find this association varies cross-sectionally with other important auditor and client characteristics. Taken together, our evidence is consistent with a positive association between the opportunity for partners to share their industry knowledge with each other and audit quality.</content>

    <title>Why did the Big Four get so large? Evidence from Australia</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use a long time-series from Australia to shed light on economic factors that led to audit market concentration and the Big N. We show that increases in the size of a small number of public companies was an important factor that led to large audit firms and market concentration. We also show that emerging Big N firms made sunk cost investments, including in the ability to provide industry expertise and non-audit services, which allowed them to retain clients, differentiate, and grow. These changes occurred around the time the profession lifted restrictions on advertising, which helped facilitate differentiation, and that larger, more complex clients switched to emerging Big N firms while smaller clients switched to non-Big N firms. We do not find that increases in audit market concentration reduced competition; our results instead suggest the audit market became more competitive over time.</content>
