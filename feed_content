    <title>EXPRESS: A Blessing or a Curse: the Impact of Sampling in Crowdfunding Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The crowdfunding market has developed fast in recent years. However, the problem of information asymmetry is still an issue for both backers and fundraisers. Hence, crowdfunding platforms design various policies to reveal more project information to backers. This paper studies the impact of product sampling, a novel policy in the crowdfunding market, and provides suggestive evidence of the underlying mechanism. A product sampling campaign can be divided into three stages chronologically. InApplication Stage, backers can apply for free samples. InTrial Stage, users of free samples experience them, but no feedback reports are available. InReport Stage, at least one feedback report is published, and backers can refer to reports when making decisions. Leveraging a rich data set from a large online crowdfunding platform in China, we construct a structural model considering both the demand and supply sides of the market. We use a consideration set model to characterize the fact that backers cannot notice all projects on the crowdfunding platform. We find that sampling campaigns raise the awareness of backers on sampling projects in all stages. However, inTrial Stage, backers’ utility of supporting the project declines, which is most likely to be attributed to backers’ strategic delay waiting for valuable feedback reports. We also find that the scores of feedback reports and the number of free samples offered serve as effective quality signals of projects. These two signals largely determine how backers’ utility changes inReport Stage. Moreover, our counterfactual analysis shows that the demand for most projects rises inApplication Stagebut falls inTrial Stage, and half of the projects see a demand increase inReport Stagewhile the other half experience a decrease. Our research strives to uncover the underlying mechanisms of product sampling in the crowdfunding market, makes methodological contributions, and provides meaningful managerial implications for fundraisers and crowdfunding platforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze how a profit‐maximizing proxy advisor designs vote recommendations and research reports. The advisor benefits from producing informative, unbiased reports, but only partially informative recommendations, biased against the a priori likely alternative. Such recommendations induce close votes, increasing controversy and thereby the relevance and value of proxy advice. Our results suggest shifting from an exclusive emphasis on recommendations, highlighting the importance of both reports and recommendations in proxy advisors' information provision. They rationalize the one‐size‐fits‐all approach and help reinterpret empirical patterns of voting behavior, suggesting that proxy advisors' recommendations may not be a suitable benchmark for evaluating shareholders' votes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Large Language Models have been incorporated into an astounding breadth of professional domains. Given their capabilities, many intellectual laborers naturally question to what extent these AI models will be able to usurp their own jobs. As behavioral scientists, we performed an effort to examine the extent to which an AI can performourroles. To achieve this, we utilized commercially available AIs (e.g., ChatGPT 4) to perform each step of the research process, culminating in an AI‐written manuscript. We attempted to intervene as little as possible in the AI‐led idea generation, empirical testing, analysis, and reporting. This allowed us to assess the limits of AIs in a behavioral research context and propose guidelines for behavioral researchers wanting to utilize AI. We found that the AIs were adept at some parts of the process and wholly inadequate at others. Our overall recommendation is that behavioral researchers use AIs judiciously and carefully monitor the outputs for quality and coherence. We additionally draw implications for editorial teams, doctoral student training, and the broader research ecosystem.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Below are comments on Tomaino, Cooke, and Hoover by four teams of collaborative reviewers that helped clarify and focus its original version. Their comments on the refined version articulate how the fast‐moving world of generative AI can alter authors, readers, reviewers, and consumer behavior journals. In the first comment, Blythe, Kulis, and McGraw propose that Generative AI requires substantial effort to generate research that is fast, cost‐effective, and of high quality. They articulate three recommendations: to ask, to train, and to check the system.Askingbuilds on GenAI's ability to reveal its own capabilities at different stages of the research process.Trainingallows the system to be customized with relevant context, domain‐specific documents, and tailored examples, enhancing its accuracy and reducing errors.Checkingis strongly advised to validate that the outputs are both reasonable and robust. Haenlein, Hewett, and Yoo build on the capabilities of Large Language Models that go beyond the research practices central to consumer psychology. They outline strategic prompting strategies: starting broadly and gradually narrowing to specific domains, downloading information from relevant articles and data that is unlikely to be part of the current corpus, and evoking specific theories, methods, or presentation formats. They also elaborate on the ways the apparent magic of GenAI may raise learning or ethical challenges. The third comment by Stacy Wood focuses less on the capabilities of GenAI and more on how its adoption will depend on researcher feelings—in other words, how different aspects of its use may alter researchers' experiences of doing research and their identities as scholars. GenAI has the potential to both build (through increased productivity or increased accessibility) and limit (through loss of agency or faster production) pride of purpose in research. She argues that feelings from using GenAI are likely to differ across research steps, from developing novel concepts, processes, analyses, and writing of the paper. Wherever GenAI may lessen the excitement, satisfaction, motivation, and perceived status of the researcher, barriers to its use are likely to be erected. Finally, Vicki Morwitz identifies new AI capabilities beyond those explored in Tomaino et al. Those include the ability to generate synthetic data that can guide empirical experiments, a facility to create audio and visual stimuli, a capability to study group behavior, and a capacity to reliably interpret complex human statements. The comment then closes with important questions for editorial policies, raising issues about limitations on AI use by authors, its appropriate applications by review teams, and possible publishers' restrictions on uploading copyrighted articles.</content>

    <title>How Do Coworkers Interpret Employee &lt;scp&gt;AI&lt;/scp&gt; Usage: Coworkers' Perceived Morality and Helping as Responses to Employee &lt;scp&gt;AI&lt;/scp&gt; Usage</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations are increasingly introducing artificial intelligence (AI) into the workplace and encouraging employees to use AI to complete work. Correspondingly, research on AI usage predominantly focuses on the positive effects of AI usage on employees themselves. Drawing upon attribution theory and AI literature and taking an interpersonal perspective, this research challenges the prevailing consensus by investigating whether, when, and how employee AI usage would lead to negative coworker outcomes. We propose that when coworkers attribute employee AI usage as a way to slack off (i.e., slack attribution), employee AI usage is negatively related to coworkers' perceived morality of the employee, which in turn decreases coworkers' helping behavior toward the employee. Two experimental studies, a field survey study, and a field experiment provide substantial support for our hypotheses. This research adds new insights into the AI usage literature by revealing the negative coworker outcomes of employee AI usage.</content>

    <title>Peer Influence in the Workplace: The Moderating Role of Task Structures Within Organizations</title>
    <updated>2025-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Peer influence is crucial in shaping work practices within organizations, yet the impact of formal organizational structures on this influence remains underexplored. We argue that task structures, which capture how tasks are allocated and configured within organizations, significantly affect peer interactions and influence. Specifically, we examine how two features of task structures—task variety and task similarity with peers—moderate peer influence in a highly consequential setting: physicians’ decisions to perform a birth via caesarean section (C-section) versus vaginal delivery. Using data on nearly 5 million births performed by more than 16,500 physicians across 915 hospitals in Brazil, we find that working alongside peers whose practice style (enduring preference) favors C-sections leads the focal physician to perform more C-sections, even after controlling for features of the mother and the pregnancy. This influence is significantly stronger for physicians with higher task variety and with higher task similarity with peers. Through post-hoc analyses, we provide evidence that the observed behaviors are consistent with a mechanism of information sharing between physicians. This study contributes to our understanding of peer influence in the workplace by showing how the task structure within organizations can either amplify or diminish peer influence. This awareness is particularly crucial for health care organizations in which such dynamics can have life-changing consequences.</content>

    <title>Incumbent response to business model innovation: The role of &lt;scp&gt;CEO&lt;/scp&gt; opportunity framing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore how CEO sensegiving through framing influences incumbent firm response to business model innovation. Our historical analysis of Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble (B&amp;N) in the US bookselling industry after the entry of Amazon.com reveals that although both CEOs framed Amazon's entry as an opportunity, they did so in strikingly different ways. Their opportunity framing differed on four dimensions—intensity, concreteness, future orientation, and inclusiveness—closely associated with specific patterns in the respective incumbent's response: separation between the old and new business model for Borders and blending of the old and new models for B&amp;N. Our study highlights the role of multidimensional and sustained opportunity framing for blending actions contributing to business model innovation in established firms over time.Managerial SummaryWhat role do CEOs play in how established firms react to new entrants with innovative business models? We examined how the CEOs at B&amp;N and Borders framed the opportunity provided by the new online business model introduced by Amazon and found significant differences in their framing that influenced how the two firms adapted to it. The more intense, concrete, future‐oriented, and inclusive framing by B&amp;N's top managers contributed to a successful blending of the traditional store‐based and the new online model, while at Borders the business models were kept separate. Our study shows the importance of multidimensional and sustained framing of digital opportunities over time for the successful integration of new business models.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how the development ofvoluntarysustainability standards has affected the nature of information covered in earnings calls. Using industry-specific dictionaries of sustainability terms contained in the disclosure standards developed by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), we find an increase in coverage of sustainability topics identified as relevant to investors in SASB standards, particularly for companies that had little or no coverage of sustainability issues historically. This trend begins around the time when SASB released aprovisionalstandard for a given company’s industry and continues in the years afterward. We also find a stronger effect of SASB standards on conference call content for companies operating in industries with greater ex ante uncertainty about which sustainability topics are more likely to be financially material. Overall, our paper provides timely evidence as jurisdictions around the world consider whether to support sustainability reporting in their capital markets and, if so, how.</content>

    <title>Blurring Boundaries in Coworker Relationships: How a Nonwork Setting Becomes a Relational Holding Environment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Positive work relationships often emerge when coworkers blur the boundaries of their work and nonwork lives in their interactions. A growing body of scholarship suggests that such boundary blurring increasingly occurs in a variety of nonwork settings. However, existing research has drawn mixed conclusions about whether boundary-blurring interactions in nonwork settings lead to beneficial or detrimental outcomes for coworker relationships. Through an inductive study of users of the exercise platform Peloton, we build theory on how and why a nonwork interaction setting facilitates work-nonwork boundary blurring that leads to positive work relationships. Our findings demonstrate that informants perceive Peloton as having a unique set of characteristics that filters out the discomfort of interacting with coworkers in a nonwork setting and provides them with new ways of understanding the potential of their coworker relationships. These two processes enable Peloton to function as a relational holding environment or — a social context that reduces uncomfortable relational affect and facilitates relational sensemaking. Experiencing Peloton as a relational holding environment motivates informants to deepen their existing positive relationships and forge a broader set of positive relationships across work-related silos. Our theory advances scholarship on work-nonwork boundaries, positive work relationships, and the psychodynamic literature on holding environments. It also has important implications for how managers and employees navigate social contexts to facilitate positive work relationships.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Efficiently Computed Periodic Ordering Heuristics in Stochastic Distribution SystemsThe difficulty of analyzing and optimizing the stochastic one-warehouse multiretailer problem under the (S,T) policy motivates the need to consider approximate but high-fidelity models that are easier to scrutinize. In “Heuristic (S,T) Solutions via an FPTAS for a One-Warehouse Multiretailer Problem,” Najy, Elbassioni, and Diabat show how to efficiently compute competitive solutions for such systems based on an approximate formulation of the inventory problem proposed by Chu and Shen (2010) and build on the assumption of power-of-two (POT) policies. The authors first devise a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the continuous relaxation of the model and then show how to round it to a POT solution within an improved approximation factor relative to the present literature. These solutions are shown via simulation to be highly competitive with optimal (S,T) solutions and are derived in a tiny fraction of the time needed by the current best (S,T) algorithms.</content>

    <title>Contextual Data-Integrated Newsvendor Solution with Operational Data Analytics (ODA)</title>
    <updated>2025-03-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Qi Feng, J. George Shanthikumar, Jian Wu</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the data-integrated newsvendor problem in which the random demand depends on a set of covariates. Observing from the solutions analyzed in the existing studies, we identify the equivariant class of operational statistics (i.e., the mapping from the demand and covariate data to the inventory decision) to develop the operational data analytics (ODA) framework for the contextual newsvendor problem. The equivariant property is intuitively appealing, and it is justified by the fact that, regardless of the sample size, no other decision rule can uniformly dominate the optimal operational statistic within the equivariant class. We also demonstrate that nonequivariant solutions can produce unstable empirical performance with limited samples, whereas equivariant solutions exhibit robustness. When the distribution family of the demand is known but the coefficients of the demand function are unknown, we can directly validate the decision performance of operational statistics within the equivariant class and derive the uniformly optimal solution. When the distribution family of the demand is unknown, we formulate the data integration model as a subclass of equivariant operational statistics, obtained through adaptively boosting some candidate solution. For decision validation, we project the validation data to the demand for the covariates of interests, and the projection is constructed by utilizing the structure of the candidate solution. We demonstrate the superior small-sample performance of adaptive boosting and establish the consistency of the boosted operational statistics. Our ODA formulation, building on the inherent characteristics of the contextual newsvendor problem, highlights the importance of understanding structural properties in data-integrated decision making.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04164 .</content>

    <title>Incentivizing Blockchain Participation Through Task Assignment Mechanisms: Evidence From a Natural Experiment of Consensus Protocols on Ethereum</title>
    <updated>2025-03-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how task assignment mechanisms affect the participation of workers on decentralized blockchains. In developing the theory, I highlight that blockchain represents a distinct organizational form for coordinating operations under a highly decentralized structure, in which the essential tasks of system infrastructure maintenance are assigned to third‐party crowd workers through the unique governance mechanism of consensus protocol. I specifically focus on two widely adopted consensus protocols in the context of cryptocurrency, namely, proof‐of‐work (PoW), which assigns tasks that sustain the blockchain system operation based on workers' investments in computing power, and proof‐of‐stake (PoS), which assigns these tasks based on workers' investments in the native cryptocurrency as stakes. I argue that compared with PoW, PoS increases worker participation and task decentralization because the investment requirement of task participation in the form of blockchain native assets reduces workers' transaction costs in task contracting and their tendencies for hyper‐competition. My empirical analysis leverages a natural experiment on Ethereum, namely, the “Merge” event on September 15, 2022, in which the blockchain changed the assignment rules by switching the consensus protocol from PoW to PoS. The results under a difference‐in‐differences research design confirm my arguments.</content>

    <title>Institutional Logics and the Post‐Financing Relationship Between Investors and Entrepreneurs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How the investor–entrepreneur relationship can be better managed and maintained during the post‐financing stage is a central question for investors and entrepreneurs alike, particularly given the large numbers of failed new venture collaborations. Extant research has generally underexplored the two‐sided nature of this process, which requires both investors and entrepreneurs to opt in, while treating the norms and values underlying such behaviours as relatively homogeneous. Drawing on the institutional logics perspective, this study offers an alternative framework to explain the effective maintaining of the crucial investor–entrepreneur relationship. This framework suggests that a similarity in the two parties' institutional logics will facilitate the formation of aligned motives and shared perceptions between investors and entrepreneurs, which helps to maintain the relationship. Moreover, the interaction foundation provided by logic similarity is situated in context, and its activation depends on investment‐ and context‐specific stimuli that can influence investors and entrepreneurs' interpretation and choice of appropriate behaviour. Empirical analyses of 2052 deals made by 1032 investors in 382 portfolio firms during the period 2000–2018 in high‐tech industries in China provide general support for these arguments.</content>

    <title>Accounting Information Usage and Trading by Retail Investors: Evidence from Integrated Trading Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This registered report investigates self‐directed retail investors' information choices and trading decisions on an integrated trading platform that provides timely and convenient access to accounting information. The analyses reveal that these investors access a mosaic of information, with a high proportion not firm‐specific. In accessing accounting disclosures, retail investors are more interested in media articles providing summaries or expert analyses than original filings. Retail trades on this integrated trading platform are more informed than another retail trading platform providing little information services while exhibiting no significant differences in informativeness compared with institutional trades usingBulge Bracketplatforms. In particular, trade informativeness is more pronounced when there are accounting disclosures. The evidence suggests that self‐directed retail investors can benefit from a trading environment that provides rich and convenient access to a mosaic of information, particularly timely accounting disclosures.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using consumer complaints filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as a measure for the quality of financial products and services, we present evidence of racial disparities in the service quality received by consumers. Consumers in high‐minority communities file more complaints than those in low‐minority communities, and the racial gap in financial complaints increased by more than 60% during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Using a triple‐difference approach, we establish the role of corporate social attitudes, reflected in, for example, inclusive promotion practices and diversity in leadership, in mitigating the complaint racial gap and its pandemic‐period increase. Our results shed light on how inclusive corporate culture filters through an organization to benefit minority communities and underscore the effect of corporate social attitudes on important stakeholder outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present a dynamic model of information acquisition and disclosure. The manager seeks to maximize future stock prices and collects information privately about the firm's fundamentals. Information acquisition increases the arrival rate of private information. The manager can choose to disclose his private information or withhold it in perpetuity. We study the impact of information acquisition on the accumulation of private information, disclosure, and the firm's initial investment.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Drawing on the organizational identification perspective, this paper proposes that employee‐friendly workplace practices can positively impact employees' innovation productivity through their identification with the organization. Using a sample of 2642 firm‐year observations from public firms in the United States, a positive relationship was found between employee‐friendly workplace practices and employee innovation productivity, which was mediated by identification with the organization. The results also showed that the employee professional human capital dampened the relationship between employee‐friendly workplace practices and employee innovation productivity. Finally, the mediated relationship between employee‐friendly workplace practices and employees' innovation productivity through organizational identification was moderated by employees' professional human capital, such as when employees are credentialed knowledge workers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a tractable dynamic contracting framework to study bank bail-in regimes. In the presence of a repeated monitoring problem, the optimal bank capital structure combines standard debt, which induces liquidation and provides strong incentives, and bail-in debt, which restores solvency but provides weaker incentives. Given fire sales, an optimal policy response entails joint regulation: a bail-in regime reduces standard debt while leverage regulation reduces total debt. Bail-ins replace bailouts as a recapitalization tool. (JEL G28, G33)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide evidence that dividend-paying stocks are less exposed to return extrapolation than non-dividend-paying stocks. In particular, social media sentiment and analyst price targets of dividend-paying stocks are significantly less sensitive to past returns. Our findings indicate that this difference stems from price changes playing a larger role in extrapolation and dividends diverting attention away from price changes for dividend-paying stocks. Consistent with models of return extrapolation, dividend-paying stocks earn lower momentum and long-term reversal returns. The value premium, however, is similar among both groups. Collectively, our findings suggest that return extrapolation is an important source of some anomaly returns.</content>

    <title>Typical Ranges as Scale-Specific Benchmarks: When and Why Percentages Amplify Relative Magnitudes and Their Differences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Business managers and policymakers must often communicate magnitudes. Yet conveying large relative magnitudes without desensitizing people to further increases can be challenging because of diminishing sensitivity to large numbers. In this research, we propose that percentage expressions not only make large relative magnitudes (e.g., 500%) appear larger than equivalent non-percentage expressions but also make large increases in relative magnitudes (e.g., from 500% to 600%) appear larger. We posit an explanation: percentages typically have values between 0% and 100%, so when percentages and percentage-point differences reach 100% or more, they seem unusually large. This hypothesis is supported by data scraped from New York Times articles and a series of online experiments employing both management-relevant scenarios and incentive-compatible decisions. Existing theories of magnitude perception either cannot predict all the results of these studies (e.g., numerosity and unitosity) or need further specification to do so (e.g., decision-by-sampling and range-frequency theory). We discuss implications for the theory of magnitude and difference perception and the practice of communicating large magnitudes and changes.This paper was accepted by Yuval Rottenstreich, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02646 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Customer preferences for product features play an important role in designing successful goods and services. Preferences for features are typically obtained by utilizing a model of choice where the utility for all but one level of an attribute is estimable. That is, the traditional discrete choice model can provide information on the change in utility between attribute-levels, but cannot separately estimate the utility associated with all levels of an attribute. In this paper, we propose a model that integrates conjoint and Maximum Difference scaling data to identify part-worth utilities for all product features, using the outside good as a common reference level, instead of the usual practice of having a reference level for each product attribute. The preference data are also integrated with satisfaction data to identify market opportunities for new and existing products. We illustrate our model with data from a survey measuring customer satisfaction and preferences for large-screen TVs.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02560 .</content>

    <title>Too Long, Didn’t Read? The Impact of Length Limits on Microblogging Engagement</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media platforms aggressively compete for the participants who create content on their sites. In this study, we delve into one tactic of this competition that has become increasingly popular but received limited scholarly attention—the extension of length limits (i.e., the maximum number of characters in a post)—and how it affects both the production and consumption of social media posts. We investigate these questions by exploiting a natural experiment, the phased rollout of length limit extensions on a leading Chinese microblog platform. Findings suggest that extending length limits significantly increased the number of daily posts of individual users. However, and strikingly, only already active users appear to post more after the extension with little observed change from less active users. Further, results show that extending length limits increases the number of likes each post receives, indicating that extensions improve content quality and may increase engagement in the long term. This suggests that, by permitting longer posts, social media platforms can facilitate engagement from both the post generators and audiences (at least in terms of likes). However, findings also suggest that extending length limits risks further concentrating content generation from the vocal minority, thereby making the silent majority less visible on the platforms.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03629 .</content>

    <title>What Do Content Moderators Do? Emotion Work and Control on a Digital Health Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Content moderation determines the type of data displayed on platforms. Although this type of work is conducted online without interpersonal interactions, it does not remain emotionless. This article presents findings from a longitudinal qualitative study of how content moderation is conducted on a UK‐based platform that publishes patients' stories of their health experiences. Drawing upon the literatures on emotion work in organizations and on content moderation, this paper addresses the questions: what is the nature of emotion work that is undertaken during content moderation and how does emotion work play out with control on online platforms? Although management studies have made extensive contributions to platform work, content moderation remains under‐theorized, despite its significance in determining the type of information platforms exhibit. The paper contributes theoretically and empirically to this field in three ways. First, it categorizes the work practices moderators undertake on a health platform, which encompass application of rules, quantification, objectification, verification, and care. Second, our paper shows that content moderation is constitutive of emotion work and goes on to identify various types of emotion work, including managed and unmanaged authentic emotions. Third, our paper offers a model that illustrates how emotion work constitutes a sense‐making mechanism that allows moderators to exercise discretion and undertake care work, bypassing the prescriptive regulatory environment of content moderation, and sourcing occasional autonomy.</content>

    <title>Manufacturing national consent for industrial policy: a microhistorical analysis of Finnish shipbuilding</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Industrial policy, the use of state power to influence the development of industries, has become increasingly influential in international business, yet its firm-level dynamics remain understudied. Through a history-to-theory approach and microhistorical analysis, we investigate how the Finnish shipbuilding industry employed nonmarket strategies (NMS) to influenceoutward-orientedindustrial policies that supported its international expansion. Grounded in New Institutional Economics, we identify two key industrial policy shifts – in the mid-1950s and early 1980s – that reduced cross-border transaction costs for Finnish shipbuilders to enhance their international competitiveness. Before each shift, the industry proactively aligned its business interests with national policy priorities, engaging in what we term “manufacturing national consent” – positioning the sector as critical to national interests to legitimize supportive policies. We critically assess the double-edged role of NMS in industrial policy, demonstrating that while it creates regulatory capture and hinders alternative economic pathways, it also fosters government–business collaboration, improving the prospects of effective policy design. We further account for country-specific factors and broader inter-country dynamics to analyze policy implications for home-country firms. In all, our study contributes to the revitalization of industrial policy as a topic in the IB discipline by uncovering the active role of firms in shaping policy outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;High commissions in the U.S. residential real estate agency market pose a puzzle for economic theory because brokerage is not a concentrated industry. We model brokered markets as a game in which agents post prices for customers and then choose which other agents to work with. We show that there exists an equilibrium in which each agent conditions working with other agents on those agents' posted prices. Prices can therefore be meaningfully higher than the competitive level (for a fixed discount factor), regardless of the number of agents. Thus, brokered markets can remain uncompetitive even with low concentration and easy entry.</content>

    <title>Supervisor Actions for Supporting Employees Through Stressful Work Situations: A Critical Events Approach From the Perspective of Supervisors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this research, we aim to further our understanding of supervisors' enactment of psychosocial risk management and their own psychological responses to supporting employees through stressful work situations. Informed by event system theorizing and the special case of affective events, we examined 342 employee critical events of a stressful nature through the eyes of the supervisor. Thematic analysis revealed 16 supervisor actions that were aggregated into nine supervisor action themes that supervisors evaluated for stressfulness and effectiveness. Clustering stressfulness and effectiveness scores revealed the emergence of three supervisor groups: favorable, unfavorable, and challenge. Multinomial logistic regressions demonstrated that both organizational and supervisor psychosocial risk management capabilities reduced the odds of supervisors developing unfavorable psychological responses in relation to their supervisor action, whereas supervisors with time pressure and psychological distress had increased odds. In addition, supervisors experiencing psychological distress had a twofold likelihood of experiencing their chosen action as both stressful and effective, calling into question the potential for future benefits to arise from what might be otherwise considered a challenge experience. Overall, our findings demonstrate that pre‐existing features of the supervisor's own psychosocial work environment shape their psychological responses to having enacted psychosocial risk management, irrespective of the type of supervisor action.</content>

    <title>Can Stereotype Reactance Prompt Women to Compete? A Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Women are consistently underrepresented in leadership roles. One contributor may be that women are generally less willing than equally-qualified men to enter competitions (e.g., for jobs or promotions). We draw from research on “stereotype reactance”—the idea that telling people about stereotyped expectations can encourage defiance—to propose and test whether telling women about the gender gap in competition entry can increase their willingness to compete. Our prediction contrasts with prior work on stereotype threat and descriptive norms suggesting that highlighting the gender competition gap might lead women to refrain from competing. In two incentive-compatible, preregistered online experiments, we find that informing women about the gender competition gap increases their likelihood of competing for higher pay, and this effect is mediated by stereotype reactance, consistent with our theorizing. Moreover, exposing both men and women to information about the gender competition gap closes the gap. We then test this informational intervention in a large-scale field experiment on an executive job search platform (n = 4,245), examining whether telling women about the gender competition gap increases their willingness to compete for leadership roles relative to a control message that tells them about an identity-irrelevant competition gap. We find that relative to our control message, informing women about the gender gap in willingness to compete increases submitted job applications by over 20% on the day of condition assignment. This suggests that women’s willingness to compete is affected not just by confidence, but also by cultural expectations and motivation to defy stereotypical norms.Funding: The authors thank the Wharton School (and in particular, the Wharton Behavioral Laboratory and Analytics at Wharton) for funding support.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.19563 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a theoretical framework and provide empirical evidence on how resource complementarity or substitutability between entrepreneurs and seed investors drives selection and value creation in the context of high-tech startups. Specifically, we argue that seed investors specialized in training programs—startup accelerators—are the ideal match for entrepreneurial teams equipped with strong technological competencies but lacking business knowledge. On the other hand, when entrepreneurs with extensive business knowledge pair up with accelerators, the value created is typically less. Combining information from Crunchbase and LinkedIn, we provide robust empirical evidence based on the assortative matching of start-ups and investors and the ex- post analysis of joint value creation.Funding: S.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Personalized recommendation systems often face the challenge of making optimal decisions when user preferences are unknown, and outcomes are only observed if users engage with the platform (e.g., clicking a recommendation). In their paper, “Online Learning with Sample Selection Bias,” Singhvi and Singhvi study this problem in the context of sequential decision making, where the censoring of outcomes leads to selection bias. Ignoring this bias results in suboptimal recommendations and linear regret, even for well-performing existing learning algorithms. To address this, they propose the sample selection bandit (SSB) algorithm, which combines Heckman’s two-step estimator with the “optimism under uncertainty” principle. The authors also demonstrate that SSB achieves a near-optimal regret rate. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real-world donation data confirm that SSB significantly outperforms existing algorithms, effectively addressing selection bias while improving recommendations and outcomes in practical settings.</content>

    <title>Consequences of Performance-Enhancing Misconduct: Insights from Professional Road Cycling, 2000–2010</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore the career consequences experienced by professional cyclists implicated in performance-enhancing drug use as well the spillover effects experienced by their teammates and managers using a data set that observes members of all teams from 2000 to 2011. Our data captures publicly known doping implications that range from informal suspicions published in the media to formal convictions by antidoping and law enforcement authorities. Our unique setting, characterized by expectations of widespread doping despite a rigorous antidoping regulatory regime and close media scrutiny, provides a new perspective on the multilayered ways that actors in competitive industries assess the competing demands of extreme performance pressures versus playing by the rules. We find that only the most severe rules violations are associated with career interruptions for riders, whereas lesser offenses are not. More ambiguous cases of doping, those based on informal suspicion or moderately punished formal convictions, are associated with career interruptions primarily for the sport’s high-performing stars. In contrast to most prior work on spillover effects from peer misconduct, we find that most riders are at a lower risk of career interruptions following teammates’ doping convictions—an effect we attribute to a vetting process in which regulators proactively target peers for increased monitoring, which resolves uncertainties about peers’ doping. Regarding spillover effects on managers’ careers, we find that only extreme levels of formal convictions that signal major team scandals are associated with increased risk of managerial career interruptions.

    <title>Estimation Using Marginal Competitor Sales Information</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An abiding preoccupation for firms is understanding how customers value their products versus competitors' products. This is difficult to quantify and estimate from data as, even if competitor prices are public information, their sales are typically unobservable. However, in some industries, most prominently the hotel industry, third‐party information brokers collect and supply aggregate competitor sales information. In the hotel industry, these reports from Smith Travel Research, popularly known as STR reports, are widely subscribed to. Hotels participate by reporting their sales information and, in turn, obtain access to marginal competitor sales data, in the form of daily occupancy percentage, albeit aggregated across groups and lengths‐of‐stay. Despite its availability, this data is not widely incorporated into revenue management estimation, likely due to the lack of robust models and methodologies. In this paper, focusing mainly on the hotel industry, we develop a constrained maximum likelihood method (constrained by moment conditions) to overcome the following significant challenges in estimation of a market share model with a competitor attractiveness factor: (i) competitor data is aggregated across multiple lengths‐of‐stay with varying demand characteristics; (ii) no‐purchase data is unobservable, preventing tracking of customers who choose neither the focal firm's (we refer to as our) product nor the competitor's product; (iii) private (unobserved) group sales of competitors prior to retail sales reduce competitor capacity and influence their subsequent prices; and finally, (iv) maximizing the partial‐information likelihood function is intractable. We first evaluate our method through Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic data generated under a generalized Nash competition model. In these simulations, our method accurately recovers the true parameters to a close degree in almost all cases, exploiting the marginal competitor data. Next, we apply the method to real‐world hotel booking data and benchmark its performance against alternative approaches from the network tomography and revenue management literature.</content>

    <title>How Group Consumption Affects Coupon Acquisition and Redemption: The Moderating Role of Offline Agglomeration in Online Group Buying</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Local merchants have implemented coupon promotions to attract consumer traffic and improve product sales. Drawing upon signaling theory, this paper examines how a social characteristic of a coupon (i.e., group consumption) influences coupon acquisition and subsequent coupon redemption, along with how such relationships are further influenced by offline agglomeration (i.e., density and product agglomeration). Specifically, we argue that group consumption increases coupon acquisition, which in turn increases coupon redemption, with coupon acquisition serving as a mediator in the relationship. These relationships, however, are contingent upon offline agglomeration signals. Using a large panel data set from a prominent group buying platform, we collect 121,909 observations to test our theoretical model. The findings reveal a positive relationship between group consumption and coupon acquisition and a positive relationship between coupon acquisition and redemption, while the relationship between group consumption and coupon redemption is fully mediated by coupon acquisition. Furthermore, we find that the effect of group consumption on coupon acquisition is strengthened by density agglomeration but attenuated by product agglomeration. The effect of coupon acquisition on redemption is reinforced by density agglomeration. These findings offer valuable implications for local merchants who are seeking to optimize their coupon promotions.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Side‐Hustle Thriving on Full‐Time Work Performance: A Conservation of Resources Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise of digital labour platforms has made side‐hustles a defining feature of modern work. The debate over whether side‐hustles benefit or burden full‐time work remains unresolved. We propose side‐hustle thriving as a key factor. Drawing on the conservation of resources theory, we theorize dual pathways: Side‐hustle thriving enhances full‐time work performance through psychological detachment from and affective well‐being within employees' full‐time roles (resource gain), yet simultaneously impairs it via side‐hustle attention residue and full‐time work resource depletion (resource depletion). Two studies, one with 10‐day experience sampling (N = 97, 644 observations) and another with a multisource, multiwave design (N = 247), support this framework. Crucially, we identify boundary segmentation preference between side‐hustles and full‐time work as a key moderator: Employees who strongly separate work domains amplify the resource gain pathway while mitigating resource depletion. This research offers a nuanced framework for managing multiple jobholding in the gig economy era.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a unique data set of firms listed on China’s Shenzhen Stock Exchange, we show that investors’ corporate site visits convey information about future stock returns. Firms with abnormally frequent investor visits predictably outperform firms with abnormally infrequent investor visits by approximately 70-to-100 basis points per month. This return predictability concentrates on neglected firms with low trading volumes and when investors incur higher travel costs. Abnormally frequent investor visits accompany increased holdings among visiting institutions and predict improvements in firms’ fundamental performance, consistent with institutions using visits to gain an information advantage regarding underpriced firms.The significance of conducting site visits and in-depth research by fund companies is to consistently deliver stable and substantial returns to clients through professional expertise.

    <title>Limits to Political Capture: Evidence from Patent Grants, Disclosures, and Litigation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Substantial evidence suggests that regulatory agencies in the United States can be captured by the politicians who oversee them. We provide novel evidence of a federal agency in which capture is limited: the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Although patent applications from politically connected applicants are slightly more likely to be approved despite being of lower ex post quality, additional analyses suggest these outcomes are not indicative of capture. In particular, the disclosure quality of connected patents' legal claims increases more than unconnected patents during the review process, narrowing the scope of the patents and constraining the intellectual property rights. Furthermore, connected patents are no more likely than others to be litigated ex post, suggesting these patent grants are not spurious. Our findings provide insights into how the design of a regulator can limit the benefits that accrue to politically connected firms.</content>

    <title>The Death of a Technical Skill</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For managers, we show that opportunities for skill development strongly influence matching in online information technology (IT) markets. Employers cannot easily circumvent labor scarcity by adopting older technologies, as workers avoid projects with declining future skill value absent substantial wage premiums. However, older workers, having shorter career horizons, are less sensitive to declining skill value, suggesting potential benefits in matching them with legacy technologies. For policy makers, our research demonstrates that labor market tightness persists across both new and old technologies in online IT markets. This challenges the notion that employers can engage in labor arbitrage by avoiding cutting-edge technologies. Policy frameworks therefore need flexibility to address skill shortages wherever they emerge. Additionally, our findings highlight the need for more granular data collection on technical skill evolution beyond broad occupational categories. Our online context provides unique insights into how corporate decisions about technology standards cascade into labor markets. The findings underscore the importance of policies promoting continuous learning and adaptability, while suggesting that age-diverse hiring practices could help address both skill shortages and age discrimination concerns in technical fields.</content>

    <title>Organizational Burden or Catalyst for Ideas? Disability as a Driver of Cognitive Flexibility and Creativity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Disability is typically perceived negatively, and employees with a disability are viewed as a burden that requires accommodation. We draw from creativity theory to challenge this view and propose that disability can make workplace imperfections salient, can function as a situational cue that increases coworkers’ cognitive flexibility, and thus can be a catalyst for creativity. We apply a multi-study, multi-method approach to test these predictions. First, results from time-lagged and objective data in a sample of 7,037 employees from 425 units of a large German car manufacturer show that units with people with disabilities generate more ideas, particularly when employees engage in perspective taking. Second, an experiment with 954 employees shows that having a colleague with a disability has a positive individual-level effect on idea generation. Third, we extend these findings with a full model test in a second experiment of 1,314 employees, which shows that having a colleague with a disability (compared to not having a colleague with a disability) leads to more idea generation and higher idea novelty. Increased cognitive flexibility mediates these effects. Together, our findings contribute to the disability, diversity, and creativity literatures by integrating disability and creativity theory and showing that disability has the potential to serve as a catalyst for creativity and, ultimately, innovation.</content>

    <title>The Mixed Gamble of Competitive Dynamics in Family‐Controlled Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We extend the mixed gamble perspective to explain how family‐controlled firms frame and evaluate the difficult trade‐off between potential gains and losses in financial wealth (FW) and socioemotional wealth (SEW) when pursuing portfolio‐level strategic initiatives, as captured by competitive aggressiveness and complexity. Analyzing 570 public‐listed Korean firms from 1998 to 2017, we find that family‐controlled firms tend to avoid competitive aggressiveness and complexity in their strategic action portfolios. However, our broader perspective leads us to identify critical boundary conditions: this reluctance weakens when firms fall below historical and social performance aspiration levels, as the risks to FW and SEW become more apparent. Conversely, their reluctance strengthens when they retain many family business group affiliations that provide safeguards for FW and SEW.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Variance decomposition approaches are often used to identify key sources of heterogeneity in firm performance. While previous variance decomposition studies have decomposed the drivers of firm performance in product markets (financial performance), we focus on differences in firms' abilities to create the resources that underlie such product market successes. Specifically, we focus on innovation performance. We identify the relative importance of technology area, corporation, business unit, and star inventor effects in determining firms' (1) innovation output, (2) innovation social value, (3) innovation value appropriation, and (4) innovation financial value. We find, across our four measures of innovation performance, the business unit effect is by far the largest (32.6 per cent), followed by the star inventor effect (11.5 per cent), the corporate effect (5.5 per cent), and the technology area effect (1.9 per cent). We discuss the implications of these findings for future innovation studies.</content>

    <title>Future Making: Towards a Practice Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Management scholars are increasingly interested in ‘future making’, observing and theorizing how organizational actors produce and enact the yet‐to‐come. However, the rapid growth of the conversation runs the risk of emptying the notion of future making, calling into question its meaning and relevance. In response to these concerns, ourPointis that there is value in understanding future making from a practice perspective. A practice perspective, we argue, is empirically sufficiently open to account for the plurality and open‐endedness of futures and future making amidst the continual emergence of interrelated crises, large‐scale challenges, and intractable technologies. Thus, it reinforces the relevance of research on future making as a central part of contemporary organizational life. At the same time, the four practice‐based dimensions elaborated in thisPointprovide sufficient conceptual specificity to discern what counts as future making and what does not, thereby providing solid ground for cumulative theory‐building and research in this area. OurPointextends research on future making in management studies by substantiating the relevance of examining and theorizing future making, and by articulating and clarifying a practice perspective on future making that directs scholarly attention to important areas for future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite increasing interest, research within the context of Africa, particularly in relation to its unique historical dynamics, remains relatively underexplored in international business (IB). ​Our paper explores how colonial-era historical legacies continue to shape the outcomes of present-day private participation infrastructure (PPI) projects in Africa. By analyzing 301 PPI projects across 102 ethnic groups in 32 African countries, we offer insights into how borders misaligned with pre-colonial ethnic boundaries contribute to conflicts that undermine project viability. The findings reveal that ethnic partitioning, defined as the division of ethnic groups across artificial national borders, negatively impacts PPI project survival, with conflict mediating this relationship. While higher institutional quality mitigates these adverse effects, its impact remains marginal. We incorporate historical perspectives and highlight the importance of considering the path dependence of contemporary institutional environments. It also addresses the growing demand for Africa-focused IB research. By incorporating ethnicity into institutional analyses, our study also challenges the traditional IB assumption regarding the primacy of national borders in business activities. Our study points to the importance of understanding historical backgrounds when doing business in Africa.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Effective communication relies on consumers remembering, sharing, and applying relevant information. Source memory, the ability to link a claim to its original source, is an essential aspect of accurate recall, attitude formation, and decision making. We propose that claim objectivity, whether a claim is a fact or an opinion, affects memory for the claim’s source. This proposal follows a two-step process: (i) opinions provide more information about sources than facts do; (ii) claims that provide more information about sources during information encoding are more likely to be accurately attributed to original sources during recall. Across thirteen pre-registered experiments (N = 7,510) and a variety of consumer domains, we investigate the effect of claim objectivity on source memory. We find that source memory is more accurate for opinions than for facts, with no consistent effect on claim recognition memory. We find support for the proposed process by manipulating facts to be more informative about sources and opinions to be less informative about sources. When forming inferences and seeking advice from sources, participants rely more on previously-shared opinions than on previously-shared facts. Our results indicate that opinions are more likely to be accurately attributed to original sources than are facts.</content>

    <title>Minding the Gap: How Perspective-Taking and Status Reflexivity Help Black Women Executives to Relate Across Difference at Work</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Workplace relationships are a necessary and critical component of being able to perform one’s job and advance in one’s career. The personal and professional resources required for navigating relationships with dissimilar work colleagues can be particularly costly for those in minority groups who are most often different from their relational partners. Drawing from interviews conducted with Black women executives, we examined how these women experience relational triggers that emphasize their differences from others because of their limited numbers at their level. Our findings indicate that Black women executives respond to these relational triggers by engaging in perspective-taking and status reflexivity to understand others’, and their own, perspectives on the identity and status differentials present in the interaction. Through an introspective process, these women assess and address gaps in how they believe their partners see them and how they see themselves, which prompts them to either reduce or maintain perceived gaps depending on the importance of the interaction partner. We also explore how reducing or maintaining the perceived gap ultimately influences how Black women think, feel, or behave toward their relational partner (i.e., relational valence) in ways that may shape how they interpret future interactions. This study advances workplace relationships research by integrating intersectionality literature and by considering how minority perspective-taking and status reflexivity can be useful in navigating relationships across difference.</content>

This paper shows that such statistical arbitrage problems can be solved in closed form for general nonparametric price forecasts and for price impact models that account for the nonlinearity in order sizes and gradual decay of impact observed empirically. The implications of these results are illustrated by an empirical case study, in which the price impact models are calibrated to proprietary metaorder data.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the joint determination of haircuts and interest rates for collateralized loans in shadow banking within a general equilibrium model. Three results emerge. First, higher downside quality (the distribution of future collateral payoffs below the debt face value) reduces haircuts only under certain conditions, whereas higher upside quality (the distribution of future collateral payoffs above the debt face value) always increases them. Second, the relative insensitivity of interest rates to shocks, compared with haircuts, occurs when shocks affect only the upside collateral quality and can also arise endogenously, with changes in haircuts amplified and changes in interest rates dampened. Third, when depositors’ saving needs increase, interest rates unexpectedly rise while haircut requirements are relaxed. The same effects occur when banks’ collateral supply shrinks.This paper was accepted by Bruno Biais, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00541 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many firms struggle with how to craft their messages in conversations with customers on social media. The problem is compounded by the fact that these conversations take place in different, simultaneous threads, each of which potentially requires a different approach depending on the conversation. This paper studies how firms can adapt their responses in individual social media conversations such that the sentiment in different conversations becomes more favorable. We examine a comprehensive set of firm-generated content elements inspired by theory of dialogic listening that emphasizes that a conversation partner should offer 1) empathetic understanding, 2) unconditional positive regard, 3) a spirit of mutual understanding, 4) presentness, and 5) genuineness. We augment this set by also considering taking conversations to a one-on-one channel and whether agents sign with their own name, indicating a personal connection. We furthermore test whether the FGC elements’ effectiveness depends on preceding user sentiment. Based on an analysis of nearly a million tweets capturing over 206k threads involving four major US banks across 10 years, we provide concrete managerial guidance on responding effectively on social media to maximize the positive impact on the sentiment of subsequent user-generated content, and how this guidance depends on preceding user sentiment.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Putting Words in Their Mouths: Firm-Generated User Content and Consumer Sharing Behavior</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;User-generated content, such as word of mouth, traditionally has been immune to firm influences. However, companies have recently started developing content and encouraging consumers to post it rather than relying solely on organic consumer-generated content. Such firm-generated user content (FGUC), which consumers can share easily, potentially alters their sharing behavior by providing specific language to be included in users’ posts. In investigating the effectiveness of FGUC, the current research addresses if and when consumers share this content and whether they alter it. It also identifies which mechanisms drive sharing decisions and the moderating effects of satisfaction. With a series of lab and field studies, the authors demonstrate that providing FGUC increases the likelihood that consumers share a post about their brand experience, by making the sharing process easier. It also tempers the extent to which dissatisfied consumers share posts, by creating incongruence with their experience. This initial, extensive assessment of the emerging FGUC phenomenon offers relevant guidance for marketers regarding when and how to use this novel tool and the potential implications for consumer welfare.</content>

    <title>Rethinking international business scholarship as cross-language knowledge production: a dialogical approach to qualitative research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As a disciplinary field, international business (IB) is characterized by language diversity. Too often, however, international business (IB) research regards language diversity as a challenge to be overcome rather than an opportunity to generate new scientific knowledge. Consequently, previous research has primarily focused on the pragmatic, logistical, and methodological hurdles of translating multilingual datasets. In contrast, this conceptual paper takes language diversity as an opportunity to produce new knowledge and proposes a dialogical approach to qualitative cross-language research. The dialogical approach has the potential to enrich IB research with novel perspectives from under-represented voices, improve the understanding of IB phenomena and nurture tolerance for diversity and inclusion through cross-language interaction. It is worth noting that the dialogical approach does not promote shared understanding but mutual understanding that is achieved through collaboration. In doing so, it builds on two types of dialogue: (self-)reflexive dialogue, and dialogue between the researcher and others (interviewees, supervisors, and collaborators participating in the research process). The outcome is knowledge that is pluralistic and multivocal, including the voices that belong to non-English-speaking participants and scholars. We argue that the dialogical approach contributes to the future vision of responsible and linguistically inclusive IB scholarship.</content>
