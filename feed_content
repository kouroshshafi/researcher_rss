    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For endogenous shaping to be recognized as an evolutionary process that helps explain the co‐evolution of firms and their environment, theories on shaping need to provide a direct link between the endogenously introduced modifications and the evolutionary trajectory of actors in the industry. Integrating insights from the sensemaking literature into the evolutionary perspective on shaping, we establish this link and identify evolutionary feedback—the response of market actors to endogenous modifications—as a distinct feature in the shaping process. To advance toward more generalized theorizing on the mechanisms of the shaping process, we ground our theoretical insights in a real‐life case by conducting a history‐friendly study of endogenous shaping and evolutionary feedback in the photovoltaic cell industry.Managerial SummaryUnderstanding how firms actively shape their environment is essential for explaining industry evolution. This study highlights the need for theories on shaping to establish a link between shapers' modifications to the industry environment and the evolutionary trajectory of firms. By integrating sensemaking insights into the evolutionary economics perspective on shaping, we provide this link and demonstrate that evolutionary feedback—market actors' responses to endogenous changes—is a distinctive feature of the shaping process. We demonstrate the shaping process and evolutionary feedback in the photovoltaic cell industry. Our findings illustrate how endogenous modifications to the industry environment triggered evolutionary feedback. This research gives managers a deeper understanding of how their strategic decisions can influence evolutionary trajectories, highlighting the importance of evolutionary feedback in this process.</content>

    <title>Delegation of decision rights and capital reallocation: Evidence from &lt;scp&gt;US&lt;/scp&gt; municipalities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the role of organizational structure in influencing internal capital reallocations. Despite the importance of flexible capital reallocation, empirical evidence suggests remarkably high levels of stability in these decisions. Adopting a behavioral perspective, we focus on information processing demands faced by boundedly rational decision‐makers as an antecedent of such decision patterns. We argue, and provide evidence, that centralization of decision rights, which increases information processing demands, results in lower levels of capital reallocations, compared with decentralized structures. Empirically, we explore the causal effect of centralization on reallocation, leveraging an exogenous variation in decision rights among Illinois state municipalities. Additional analyses provide further evidence that a likely mechanism explaining our findings is that of decentralization reducing information processing load on decision‐makers.Managerial SummaryDrawing on data from municipalities in the State of Illinois, we show that the delegation of decision rights for resource allocation leads to a higher reallocation among municipal functions, compared with a centralized decision‐making structure. Organizations often face resource constraints, and they must make trade‐offs when allocating resources to competing projects. In such an environment, resource reallocation process can be paramount to achieving strategic goals. Given that managers have a choice in designing decision‐making arrangements for allocation of resources, they can decide to (de)centralize resource allocation process according to the desirability of reallocation. Our findings indicate that centralization of decision‐making leads to a greater information processing burden faced by managers, affecting the magnitude of resource reallocation.</content>

    <title>“Descended from Immigrants and Revolutionists:” How Family History Shapes Immigration Policymaking</title>
    <updated>2025-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does family history matter for policymaking in democracies? Linking members of Congress to the census, we observe countries of birth for members, their parents, and their grandparents, allowing us to measure ancestry for the politicians in office when U.S. immigration policy changed dramatically, from closing the border in the 1920s to reshaping admittance criteria in the 1960s. We find that legislators descended from immigrant parents or grandparents support more permissive immigration legislation. They are also less likely to speak negatively about immigration in speeches before Congress. A regression discontinuity design analyzing close elections, which addresses district-level selection and holds district composition constant, confirms our results on roll call voting and speech. Efforts to account for selection into immigration—such as comparing international immigrants to domestic migrants and exploiting variation in restrictive legislation targeting specific regions of origin—further confirm the relationship between family immigration experience and more permissive stances on immigration policy. We then explore mechanisms, finding support for in-group identity in connecting family history with policymaking. MCs name their children in ways that express immigrant identity, and immigrant-descended MCs discuss immigration using more personal frames, emphasizing family over economic considerations. Our findings illustrate the important role of personal background in legislative behavior in democratic societies, even on major and controversial topics like immigration, and suggest how experiences transmitted from previous generations can inform lawmakers’ views.</content>

    <title>Reject or Protect? Corrective Action in Response to Women’s vs. Men’s Reports of Workplace Abuse</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations encourage employees to report abusive behavior as such reports are believed to facilitate corrective action against transgressors. However, there are competing perspectives on whether reports made by women (versus men) will facilitate corrective action. On the one hand, a dominant stream of research suggests that reports made by women are often ignored and disregarded because women are not seen as credible. On the other hand, an emerging stream of research suggests that third parties will see reports made by women as serious and important. To reconcile these perspectives, we draw on aversive discrimination theory, which hints that the degree of corroboration about abuse plays a key role. That is, under situations of low corroboration, third parties are unlikely to take corrective action when women (versus men) make reports, but under situations of high corroboration, third parties are equally or even more likely to take corrective action when women (versus men) make reports. We additionally theorize and find that corroboration is particularly influential when the reporter’s general credibility is not established. Our empirical package includes six complementary studies: an archival data set of U.S. Government employees and five preregistered experiments.Funding: For financial assistance, we thank the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [Junior Faculty Development Award].</content>

    <title>Designing AI-Based Work Processes: How the Timing of AI Advice Affects Diagnostic Decision Making</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although clinical artificial intelligence (AI) systems can augment medical diagnosis decisions by providing competent second opinions, how to effectively integrate AI into routine diagnostic processes, such as when to present AI advice to human physicians, remains largely unexplored. Therefore, our research experimentally examines how the timing of AI advice affects diagnostic decision making using a think-aloud approach. Physicians perform medical diagnoses under three conditions: ex post advice (AI advice given after an initial diagnosis), ex ante advice (AI advice given concurrently with clinical information), and a control condition (no AI advice). Our results indicate that the timing of AI advice significantly affects diagnostic accuracy and calibration, with the ex post advice condition yielding the best performance and the control condition the worst. We then conduct several analyses to disentangle the underlying mechanism. We reveal that the superior diagnostic quality in the ex post advice condition can be attributed to more thorough clinical information processing and more active cognitive engagement with AI’s reasoning rationale. As a result, participants in the ex post advice condition are more capable of differentiating correct from incorrect AI advice than those in the ex ante advice condition. Additionally, they benefit more from high-quality AI advice that contradicts their initial diagnoses. To gain additional insights, we estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects based on physician and clinical case characteristics. Our findings underscore the importance of presenting AI advice at appropriate times during routine diagnostic processes to achieve successful decision augmentation with AI advice.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: This work was supported by the National University of Singapore [Grants Dean Strategic Fund - Health Informatics (HIIOT)/E and NSCP/ N-171-000-499-001] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72301279].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01454 .</content>

    <title>Skilled Labor Uncertainty and Corporate Investment: Evidence from H-1B Visa Lottery Cycles</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how periodic uncertainty about skilled labor supply affects corporate investment using the H-1B visa program for skilled workers as an empirical setting. Exploiting cross-regional variation in H-1B labor flows based on historical immigrant enclaves, we find that firms in regions that attract more H-1B workers concentrate their investments in the quarter after uncertainty about visa access is resolved by the H-1B lottery. Consistent with a skilled labor uncertainty channel, we find that the investment spikes are confined to industries where invested capital cannot be easily redeployed, to firms that cannot easily find domestic substitutes for lost H-1B workers, and to firms that cannot easily arrange alternative employment visas for their foreign employees.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: S.-J.

    <title>Confronting the Climate Crisis: Fossil Fuel Hegemony and the Need for Decarbonization, Degrowth, and Democracy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this Counterpoint, we argue for the importance of social movements in responding to the climate crisis by challenging the taken‐for‐granted practices and policies of corporate capitalism. These challenges politicize what is seen as ‘common sense’ and show that there are alternatives to the dominant social order of fossil‐fuelled economic growth. More specifically, we set out three ways to minimise future harm and suffering by discussing (i) the required decarbonisation of the economic system, (ii) the eventual degrowth needed to address the existing crisis and avoiding the creation of another, and (iii) the strengthening of democracy essential to breaking fossil fuel dependence. Challenges to corporate capitalism are often accused of being naïve and unrealistic, but responding to climate change demands an epochal rethink of what should be seen as ‘sensible’.</content>

    <title>War as a Phenomenon of Inquiry in Management Studies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We argue that war as a phenomenon deserves more focused attention in management. First, we highlight why war is an important and relevant area of inquiry for management scholars. We then integrate scattered conversations on war in management studies into a framework structured around three building blocks – (a) the nature of war from an organizational viewpoint, (b) the actors involved in war and (c) war's contextual factors. This framework provides a roadmap to identify pressing questions that management scholars can address, thus laying the foundations of a programmatic theory for analysing war as a specific area of inquiry. We especially emphasize the recursive relationship between war and management theory, demonstrating how they can mutually inform each other. Finally, we highlight empirical challenges and offer specific recommendations to guide future management research on war. Aiming to stimulate a new scholarly conversation, this paper contributes to establishing a forward‐looking research agenda that can help management scholars problematize key issues in the analysis of war.</content>

    <title>Submission titled: “It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it”: Committed consumers' voluntary emotion work in alternative market systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite increasing attention to alternative market systems, where consumers perform considerable voluntary labor, consumer researchers have a limited understanding of the nature or implications of the emotion work entailed in making such contributions. This paper addresses this gap, focusing on “committed consumers” defined as those who provide extensive volunteer labor to support alternative markets and their principles. It does so based on hermeneutic analysis of ethnographic and netnographic data collected from participants in local food markets (REKO markets) in Norway. The paper identifies four distinct types of institutional emotion work that contribute to perpetuating alternative markets and conceptualizes how committed consumers' own emotions are affected when making such contributions. This paper extends our understanding of consumers' roles in alternative market systems and of the socially constituted and constitutive emotions entailed in consumer volunteerism.</content>

    <title>Strategic Scientific Disclosure: Evidence from the Leahy–Smith America Invents Act</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of technological competition on voluntary innovation disclosure around the enactment of the Leahy–Smith America Invents Act of 2011 (“AIA”). The AIA moves the US patent system from the first‐to‐invent to first‐inventor‐to‐file system and induces a patent race that increases technological competition. Firms that are slow to file a patent are disadvantaged in this race. We find that focal firms with lagging patent classes strategically increase scientific publications in their lagging technology areas in an attempt to block competitors from obtaining a patent. This effect is more pronounced in technology areas where the firm has better information about their relative competitive position (proxied by greater inventor mobility), in technology classes with constraints on increasing patent filing timeliness (proxied by fewer experienced attorneys), and areas characterized by more intense competition. We find that the peers of firms with lagging classes experience greater patent filing rejections for lack of novelty and obviousness reasons after the AIA, suggesting that strategic scientific disclosure is effective.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Researchers constantly face challenging new phenomena that warrant study. Although we do a remarkable job of studying these phenomena, we continue to miss a big opportunity to learn from these findings in ways that can help future work. This article calls for researchers to re-think common major research processes to abstract principles that can lead to more cumulative knowledge. Specifically, this paper suggests change related to four research activities—defining the problem, anchoring to prior research, seeking novelty, and reporting practices.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper contributes to sustainable HRM theory, policy, and practice by applying and extending systems theory. A framing is developed and applied by triangulating data from 85 interviews with workers, managers, and other stakeholders (e.g., unions, employer representatives, charities) in adult social care, along with qualitative and quantitative secondary data sources. The findings highlight three main (un)sustainable HRM challenges shaped by inconsistencies between employment in the public and independent sectors:constrained system resources,disconnected career structures, anduneven voice patterns. The article contributes to HR theory by re‐framing “(un)sustainable HRM” to include how actors are constrained and/or supported by multi‐level relationships between systems and sub‐systems. The research advances policy and practice by proposing how more sustainable HRM approaches could be implemented.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Destructive entrepreneurship is an important research topic because it challenges the frequent implicit assumption that all entrepreneurship is “good.” Recent scholarly interest has been directed toward destructive entrepreneurship from various perspectives, including economics, psychology, and business ethics. This article offers a comprehensive review of the literature on destructive entrepreneurship. We begin with a definition of destructive entrepreneurship, distinguishing it from seemingly similar constructs, such as unproductive entrepreneurship. We organize the fragmented studies into a multilevel model highlighting what we know about destructive entrepreneurship. This study also reveals potential holes in this framework that future research can fill.</content>

First, we attempted an exact replication to rule out mistakes and questionable manipulations influencing the original results. Second, we included the initial stage of development as an additional control variable, reflecting on updates suggested in later research. Third, we extended the original analyses using a sample from a different spatiotemporal context, enhancing theoretical generalizability. We largely validate D&amp;H’s findings, highlight the importance of modeling initial entrepreneurial processes, and emphasize the underappreciated complexities and value of replication studies.</content>

    <title>Systemizing Entrepreneurial Metacognition: Thinking About the Past and Future</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This review of the entrepreneurial metacognition literature systematizes the existing literature. Metacognition is vital for entrepreneurs to sense, act, and mobilize cognitive resources under uncertainty. Despite the rapidly growing stream of metacognitive research in entrepreneurship, indicating that the topic is promising and emerging, these bits of knowledge still need to be brought together to provide a big picture of where we have been to explore where we can go. Our review addresses this need by analyzing the literature on entrepreneurial metacognition. We define entrepreneurial metacognition as the mental activities of generating self-awareness and monitoring and controlling one’s cognition about identifying potential opportunities, creating a new venture, and/or managing a new venture. The inductive results reveal five attributes that reflect the essence of entrepreneurial metacognition: (a) adaptive cognition, (b) metaheuristics, (c) self-regulated cognition, (d) cultural adaptation, and (e) metacompetencies. We address definitional issues and empirical patterns, synthesize the attributes of entrepreneurial metacognition, and present a model that links entrepreneurial metacognition’s antecedents and outcomes to advance future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why do migrants return home and start businesses? Research on this multistage phenomenon—that is, return followed by entrepreneurship—is fragmented, reflecting different scholarly approaches and reasons migrants return and start businesses (or not). We systematically review 80 papers addressing aspects of returnee entrepreneurship and organize findings into a two-stage process model grounded in three levels of analysis—institutional, social, and individual. Our model contributes by providing a parsimonious way to understand returnee entrepreneurship and describe what has been learned. We also contribute a research agenda to help entrepreneurship scholars leverage what is known about entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial processes to address critical unanswered questions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How new family CEOs use the structural setup they initially find to foster post-succession change in their family firms remains a theoretical and practical puzzle. Building on strategic change and family succession insights, we draw upon 74 interviews from 43 intra-family CEO successions to employ a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. We reveal three change-enabling solutions (authority, empowerment, and alignment) and develop a model of how new family CEOs navigate different structural setups. We add configurational insights to strategic change research in entrepreneurial organizations such as family firms, extend knowledge on new CEO power, and provide contingency factors to the role of new CEO distance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As threats to democracy endanger the rights and freedoms of people around the world, scholars are increasingly interrogating the role that organizations play in shaping democratic and authoritarian societies. Just as societies can be more or less democratic, so, too, can organizations. This essay, in honor ofASQ’s 70th volume, argues for a deeper focus in organizational research on the extent to which organizations themselves are democratic and the outcomes associated with these varied models of organizing. First, we provide a framework for considering the extent to which organizations are democratically organized, accounting for the varied ways in which workers can participate in their organizations. Second, we call for research on the outcomes associated with democratic organizing at both the organizational and societal levels. We build from research arguing that the extent to which workers participate in organizational decision making can spill over to impact their expectations of and participation in civic life. Moving forward, we argue it is critical to recognize that questions of democracy and authoritarianism concern not only the political contexts in which organizations are embedded but also how organizations themselves are structured and contribute to society.</content>

    <title>In Safe Hands: The Financial and Real Impact of Investor Composition over the Credit Cycle</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I show that investor composition affects bond price dynamics and capital allocation during crises. Using large-scale holdings data and within-firm ownership variation across near-identical bonds, I causally identify bond returns’ investor composition elasticities. Corporate bonds held predominantly by insurers rather than mutual funds suffer milder losses in downturns: increasing insurer holdings by half a bond’s size causes 20% shallower drawdowns. A shift-share instrument isolates variation from large insurers’ idiosyncratic primary-market allocations. Differences in intermediaries’ liability structures drive these results, which hold across countries. During crises, firms with more stable bondholders maintain higher borrowing at lower cost and invest more. (JEL G00, G12, G23, G30, E22, E30)</content>

    <title>Common Pricing of Decentralized Risk: A Linear Option Pricing Model</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a top-down linear option pricing model that unifies the pricing of different option contracts not by assuming common dynamics but by imposing common pricing on each risk source in proportion to decentralized risk estimates. The model generates significantly better pricing performance than existing bottom-up models. Its high-dimensional risk structure effectively explains the options return variation, allowing for the seamless integration of option pricing with risk management. The market price of risk estimate from the model strongly predicts the future excess return of the corresponding risk-targeting option portfolio, an important dimension of attribute completely absent from prior literature.

    <title>‘Bad’ Oil, ‘Worse’ Oil and Carbon Misallocation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Not all barrels of oil are created equal: their extraction varies in both private cost and carbon intensity. Leveraging a comprehensive micro-dataset on world oil fields, alongside detailed estimates of carbon intensities and private extraction costs, this study quantifies the additional emissions and costs from having extracted the ’wrong’ deposits. We do so by comparing historical deposit-level supplies to counterfactuals that factor in pollution costs, while keeping annual global consumption unchanged. Between 1992 and 2018, carbon misallocation amounted to at least 11.00 gigatons of CO2-equivalent, incurring an environmental cost evaluated at $2.2 trillion (US$2018). This translates into a significant supply-side ecological debt for major producers of high-carbon oil. Looking forward, we estimate the gains from making deposit-level extraction socially optimal at about 9.30 gigatons of CO2-equivalent evaluated at $1.9 trillion along a future aggregate demand pathway coherent with the objective of net-zero emissions in 2050, and document unequal reserve stranding across oil nations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do global value chain (GVC) linkages modify countries’ incentives to impose import protection? Are these linkages important determinants of trade policy in practice? We develop a new approach to modeling tariff setting with GVCs, in which optimal policy depends on the nationality of value-added content embedded in home and foreign final goods. Theory predicts that discretionary tariffs will be decreasing in the domestic content of foreign-produced final goods and the foreign content of domestically-produced final goods. Using data for 14 countries between 1995 and 2015, we show that governments set lower tariffs and curb their use of temporary trade barriers where GVC linkages are strongest, consistent with theory. Turning to quantitative model counterfactuals, we find that severing GVC linkages would lead to the disappearance of tariff preferences. Further, targeted policies to decouple China from GVCs would increase the optimal tariff set by G7 countries on Chinese exports.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Group Service or Individual Service? Differentiated Pricing for a Private or Public Service Provider</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Facilitated by information technology and online platforms, group service has emerged in many service systems, such as one-to-many tour guide service, one-to-many tutoring courses and one-to-many medical diagnosis. We consider a service provider offering both group service and individual service and model it as a single-server queue in which customers with heterogeneous waiting costs make both joining/balking and group/individual service decisions. We solve the private provider's service assortment and pricing strategies for profit maximization (system C), whose solution leads to six equilibrium structures. Furthermore, both equilibrium service volume and service price are nonmonotonic in the potential arrival rate, which contradicts classical theory due to the follow-the-crowd (FTC) characteristics associated with group service. This leads to a counterintuitive and novel pricing implication: sustaining full coverage in a larger market may necessitate an increase in service prices when group service is offered. We then numerically show that the optimal group size is unique. Furthermore, compared with scenarios where only individual service is provided, the simultaneous provision of both services can create a win-win-win situation, particularly when the potential arrival rate is relatively high. We extend the discussion to the scenario with a welfare-maximizing objective (system S) and show that the aforementioned results continue to hold. Furthermore, we find that the socially optimal price is lower than the profit-maximizing price, resulting in a larger total number of customers served in system S. Notably, our findings suggest that system S is more likely to provide group service and achieve full market coverage than system C.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Probabilistic Selling with Customization? a Theoretical Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Customized mystery bag/box products are examples of a new business model of combining probabilistic selling and customization in practice. We develop an analytical framework to study the economic value of customized mystery bag/box products and explore the interrelationship between probabilistic selling and customization. We define probabilistic selling and customization to be complements (substitutes) as that customization increases (decreases) the value of probabilistic selling. We find that probabilistic selling and customization may be either complements or substitutes, which depends on the customization level and the product marginal cost. As long as customization level is low and product marginal cost is high, they are generally complements. The complementarity benefit comes from the fact that customization can enhance probabilistic selling's price improvement value when the customization level is sufficiently low. In addition, the complementarity benefit reaches the maximum when the product marginal cost is sufficiently large and the customization is at an intermediate level. We further show that probabilistic selling and customization may still be complements when the customization level is endogenously determined with investment cost, when the customization service is strategically chosen by consumers, when the inventory decision is optimized with demand uncertainty, or when customization is achieved by product assortment planning.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research assesses the impact of Indian government-mandated firms’ corporate social responsibility (CSR) related investments on gross margins. Using a multi-method approach, we show (i) a positive relationship between CSR investments and gross margin and (ii) the moderating role of advertising investment. The contribution of our research is three-fold. First, our results suggest that mandating firms to spend on CSR can be a win-win situation for firms and governments, as opposed to the view of considering mandatory CSR as an additional burden. Second, our inquiry is one of the first to analytically and empirically show CSR contribution positively affects gross margin premium, which is based on price, an important revenue-generating marketing and operations construct. Third, we show the moderating role of advertising in achieving CSR related gross-margin premium. We discuss our study’s implications for marketing and operations managers and policymakers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Behaviour-Based Pricing for Competing Firms Facing Variety-Seeking Consumers</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many firms adopt behavioural-based pricing (BBP) to customize prices for both existing and new consumers whose valuations of products are influenced by the variety-seeking behaviour, i.e., the tendency to pursue diversity in brand or product choices. While this behaviour is common in practice, it remains under-explored in the literature. To investigate BBP in markets with variety-seeking consumers, we develop a two-period model involving two competing firms. Our findings reveal that when firms adopt BBP, a greater degree of variety-seeking among consumers mitigates first-period price competition, resulting in higher profits for the firms. The adoption of BBP increases profits when consumers exhibit high variety-seeking behaviour, enhances consumer welfare when this behaviour is low, and can lead to mutually beneficial outcomes for both firms and consumers. If a firm unilaterally adopts BBP, its competitor benefits when the consumer’s variety-seeking degree is high. In scenarios where firms can strategically decide whether to adopt BBP, asymmetric equilibria may arise, with only one firm choosing to implement it. Firms may strategically adopt BBP without necessarily price-discriminating consumers, as the potential for price discrimination can reduce first-period competition. When BBP is exogenously feasible, firms experience higher profits in relation to the consumer’s variety-seeking degree compared with when it is not feasible, with gains from BBP feasibility increasing as the degree of variety-seeking rises. In addition, with behavioural-based personalized pricing, i.e., firms can charge tailored prices to existing consumers, profits also increase with the consumer’s variety-seeking degree. However, with behavioural-based services, i.e., firms can customize prices for both new and past consumers and provide additional services to previous customers, as variety-seeking behaviour increases, service levels decline while profits initially decrease before they rise again. These findings highlight the distinct characteristics of BBP and elucidate various real-world operational strategies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Currently, major online retail platforms, such as Amazon and JD, provide both conventional reselling channels and online marketplaces (i.e., agency channels), enabling their suppliers to encroach more efficiently than the traditional self-established direct channel. We construct a parsimonious model of a bilateral monopoly supply chain where the supplier can encroach through online marketplaces as both reselling and agency channels are available. Surprisingly, the encroachment option does not necessarily benefit the supplier. Unlike the traditional supplier encroachment literature, the supplier now always prefers simultaneous ordering, suggesting that more information can hurt the supplier. We further characterize the retailer’s channel offering strategy and identify a win-win region where both firms prefer encroachment (i.e., the hybrid mode). Our work provides a guideline for supplier encroachment in the era of dominant platforms and sheds light on its impact on vertical channel relationships.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Joint Estimation of the Arrival Rate and Customer Taste Coefficients from Censored Transactional Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This work aims to jointly estimate the arrival rate of customers to a market and the nested logit model that forecasts hierarchical customer choices from an assortment of products. The estimation is based on censored transactional data, where lost sales are not recorded. The goal is to determine the arrival rate, customer taste coefficients, and nest dissimilarity parameters that maximize the likelihood of the observed data. The problem is formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation model that addresses two prevailing challenges in the existing literature: estimating demand fromdata with unobservable lost salesand capturingcustomer taste heterogeneity arising from hierarchical choices. However, the model is intractable to solve or analyze due to the non-concavity of the likelihood function in both taste coefficients and dissimilarity parameters. We characterize conditions under which the model parameters are identifiable. Our results reveal that the parameter identification is influenced by thediversity of products and nests. We also develop a sequential minorization-maximization algorithm to solve the problem, by which the problem boils down to solving a series of convex optimization models with simple structures. Then, we show the convergence of the algorithm by leveraging the structural properties of these models. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm by comparing it with widely used benchmarks, using both synthetic and real data. Our findings show that the algorithm consistently outperforms the benchmarks in maximizing in-sample likelihood and ranks among the top two in out-of-sample prediction accuracy. Moreover, our algorithm is particularly effective in estimating nested logit models with low dissimilarity parameters, yielding higher profitability compared to the benchmarks.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Sellers’ Peer Comparison under Uncertainty in Online Marketplace</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How will peer pressure among sellers affect their operations in an online marketplace? Motivated by online platforms’ marketplace designs that prompt sellers to compare their performances, in this paper, we develop and study a price competition model in which sellers account for both profits and peer comparison outcomes. In our model, two sellers offer substitutable products, and each of them sets a price ex ante to maximize their expected total utility, which is the sum of one’s profit and the payoff from peer comparison. In particular, peer comparison takes place ex post based on sellers’ realized sales. It results in a penalty for one’s underperformance (i.e., sellers are behind-averse) or a reward for outperformance (i.e., sellers are ahead-seeking) relative to the other seller. Contrary to what extant research on social comparison would predict, we find that peer comparison is not always pro-competitive. Indeed, while the behind-aversion aspect of peer comparison fosters competition, the ahead-seeking aspect can be anti-competitive when the market uncertainty is sufficiently large. This is because market uncertainty causes a greatervariationin sellers’ performance disparity ex post (uncertainty effect), which can have a more salient impact on sellers than theexpectationof their performance gap (comparison effect); While sellers’ behind-aversion further aggravates the uncertainty effect and encourages them to take more aggressive actions, their ahead-seeking counterbalances the tension by absorbing part of it into the comparison effect and moderating the marginal disutility of lagging behind. Overall, we find that peer comparison can intensify sellers’ price competition, which lowers the expected profits and utilities for both sellers, benefits the consumers, and reduces the hosting platform’s profit. Our main insights are robust in a number of extensions, including general demand specifications, seller asymmetry, sellers’ misperceptions of market uncertainties, and consumers’ reference-dependent decision-making. They highlight the importance of sellers’ behavioral regularities in online platforms’ daily operations and shed light on marketplace designs regarding algorithmic transparency, information sharing, and so forth.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The COVID-19 crisis has starkly highlighted the vulnerability of businesses and underscored the critical importance of organizational resilience. Firms across multiple sectors—particularly non-essential businesses—have suffered a heavy blow during the height of the pandemic. Guided by the resource dependence theory and using a proprietary and rich dataset from a leading online-to-offline (O2O) platform for medical aesthetics services—a typical type of non-essential business, we find that the pandemic adversely affects clinic performance in terms of the number of orders a clinic received on the platform. However, the adoption of telemedicine enables clinics to mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic on clinic performance, which is referred to as “digital resilience”. Moreover, we reveal that the mitigating effect of telemedicine adoption on clinic performance is stronger for smaller clinics and those focusing on lower-risk products. Additional analyses reveal that telemedicine also bolsters consumer interest in specific products during the pandemic, regardless of the product risk level. Furthermore, telemedicine takes effect amid the pandemic mainly by cultivating the interests of more experienced consumers. Our study contributes to the operations management literature by exploring the impacts of COVID-19 and digital resilience in non-essential sectors. It also offers practical insights for these businesses to improve their crisis responses and gain strategic digital resilience in the face of a sudden crisis.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dominant online platforms are increasingly collecting user-specific data across multiple markets, raising red flags as regards privacy, as well as potential anti-competitive abuses. We analyze competition among two platforms, with one platform collecting data in market 1 where it is dominant, using it to improve its competitive edge in market 2 where it competes in both prices and advertisements with the other platform. Our analysis unearths a novel anti-competitive effect of competition – that increased market 2 competition may increase the dominant firm’s market power in market 1, which in turn leads to several interesting results. First, that data collection by the dominant firm is increasing in market 2 competition. Second, efficiency of data collection is non-monotonic in the level of competition; being, from a welfare perspective, excessive (respectively low) whenever market competition is at an intermediate level (respectively weak). We then use this framework to examine several policy proposals – user control of data, blocking data-driven mergers, restricting data collection, and allowing data-sharing – deriving actionable prescriptions for managers and policymakers. For example, in markets with effective ad-targeting, we find that user control of data decreases data collection, thus improving privacy, if and only if competition is strong.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Modern decision-support applications build on planning parameters such as lead time, price, yield, etc., which are maintained as master data. The accuracy of master data significantly influences the viability of such applications. However, the maintenance of master data is considered a tedious and error-prone task. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of plan lead times. We apply both unsupervised and supervised learning methods for creating lead time prediction models. We test our approach using historical data of a global equipment manufacturer. In a numerical analysis the calculated plan lead times are over 30% more accurate than current plan lead times in terms of mean-squared-error (MSE). This increased accuracy of plan lead times reduces inventory investment by approximately 7%.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Follow My Lead? Impacts of Multi-dimensional Expert Reviews on Subsequent Consumer Ratings</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To mitigate information asymmetry, Expert Review Programs, in which experts evaluate products on multiple dimensions, have gained traction on platforms. However, the role of multi-dimensional expert reviews and how they affect consumer behaviors remain unknown. Using an empirical opportunity on an automobile review platform, we investigate how multi-dimensional expert reviews affect subsequent consumer ratings and the underlying mechanism. Our findings first reveal that expert reviews tend to be neutral and more critical than consumer ratings. We then find that consumers provide reviews with higher ratings following expert reviews due to the information disclosure effect. Decomposing the effect by expert reviews’ multi-dimensional characteristics, we find the effect is attenuated by multi-dimensional expert rating valence and multi-dimensional rating discrepancy between experts and consumers but amplified by multi-dimensional expert rating variance. Natural language processing of consumer review texts unveils a positive impact of multi-dimensional expert reviews on consumer satisfaction and a negative impact on consumer disappointment, which speaks to the underlying mechanism behind the information disclosure effect. Lastly, we find that the effect varies with expert characteristics, product characteristics, and information channels, diminishes when multi-dimensional expert reviews are posted sooner after product launch, and decays over time but persists in the long run. These findings not only advance information theories in understanding expert reviews and multi-dimensional rating systems but also provide valuable insights for stakeholders, such as platforms, firms, and expert reviewers, to improve review program operations and consumer engagement.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Team Design and Its Implications for Competition and Disclosure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how the composition of managerial teams influences the information and competitive landscapes in which firms operate. Specifically, the impact of teams depends on the task environment under which they operate and the extent of competition the firm faces in the product markets. Under a substitute task environment, team heterogeneity better facilitates firm learning, whereas, under a complementary task environment, team homogeneity enhances learning. However, more learning is not always optimal, as this accentuates adverse selection concerns, which leads the firm’s rival to counter by becoming more aggressive in competition. This, in turn, forces the firm to cede some of its information advantage through disclosures. In effect, when designing teams to manage information, the firm must balance its learning needs with its rival’s competitive threats. Consequently, in a substitute task environment, team heterogeneity is only optimal for the firm when competition is not fierce, and homogeneity is desirable otherwise. In a complementary task environment, the preference for teams as a function of competition is reversed. Additionally, any inherent heterogeneity in the level of competition in the product markets in which the firm operates diminishes the demand for team heterogeneity. The paper also derives the firm’s optimal team composition when the markets are characterized by Bertrand or Cournot competition; when the available managerial pool for the firm is constrained or unconstrained; when tasks are market-specific or firm specific; and when the task environment is generalized.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the increasingly uncertain future of brick-and-mortar (B&amp;M) retailing, companies are exploring new ways to avoid the high costs associated with maintaining traditional, full-service retail stores. One solution, pop-up stores, has gained popularity in recent years. This paper uses empirical evidence from a leading U.S. retailer to examine the value of pop-up retailing. Specifically, we focus on pop-up stores operated by a traditional multichannel retailer over three years and examine their impact on customer demand and order fulfillment in the short run and long run. We further evaluate whether the impact of a pop-up store is sensitive to its operational terms, including whether it is a first-time or returning “pop-up” to a market region and the duration of the store. Using a quasi-field experiment, we find that having pop-up stores leads to an expansion in the overall demand during and after operations, indicating a spillover effect that extends beyond a pop-up store's limited operational window. From an operational perspective, our empirical evidence suggests that customers migrate from the online channel to pop-up stores for faster demand fulfillment. Moreover, recurring pop-up stores are slightly less effective at stimulating local demand than first-time pop-up stores. Finally, results reveal that pop-up stores are not as effective as permanent stores in generating demand; however, the flexibility in operations still makes pop-up stores an attractive physical retail format, especially for exploring markets with modest potential.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Converting Counterfeiters in Emerging Markets to Authorized Suppliers: a New Anti-Counterfeiting Measure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, “super fakes,” i.e., high-quality counterfeits, have gained popularity. The ability of super fake manufacturers to produce high-quality products has inspired a novel anti-counterfeiting measure:converting counterfeiters to authorized suppliers. We develop a game-theoretic model to examine the interactions between a brand-name firm with a licit home supplier and a counterfeiter who can be potentially converted to an authorized overseas supplier. Our analysis leads to three main results. First, the brand-name firm can convert the counterfeiter to a licit supplier through either dual sourcing or single sourcing when the cost differential between two suppliers is moderate to high, or the quality perception differential between brand-name products produced by two suppliers is low. However, this conversion does not necessarily prevent counterfeiting unless the penalty from law enforcement is stringent. Our paper recommends that brand-name firms strategically use their wholesale pricing and sourcing decisions to establish socially responsible supply chain operations and prevent counterfeiting. Second, while dual sourcing is known for its risk diversification, our study identifies another benefit previously not reported in the literature: mitigating counterfeit risks. Dual sourcing can be more effective than single sourcing as the quality perception of super fakes approaches that of brand-name products, and its effectiveness becomes more pronounced when the brand-name firm offers wholesale price contracts in a sequential order. Conversely, single sourcing is preferable under conditions of high cost differential and low quality perception differential. Lastly, converting counterfeiters to authorized suppliers can reduce consumer surplus and does not improve social surplus unless authorities enforce high penalties on counterfeiters or the cost differential between two suppliers is substantial.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Customer service has evolved beyond in-person visits and phone calls to include live chat, AI chatbots and social media, among other contact options. Service providers typically refer to these contact modalities as “channels”. Within each channel, customer service agents are tasked with managing and resolving a stream of inbound service requests. Each request involves milestones where the agent must decide whether to keep assisting the customer or to transfer them to a more skilled – and often costlier – provider. To understand how this request resolution process should be managed, we develop a model in which each channel is represented as a gatekeeper system and characterize the structure of the optimal request resolution policy. We then turn to the broader question of the firm’s customer service design, which includes the strategic problem of which channels to deploy, the tactical questions of at what level to staff the live-agent channel and to what extent to train an AI chatbot, and the operational question of how to control the live-agent channel. Examining the interplay between strategic, tactical, and operational decisions through numerical methods, we show, among other insights, that service quality can be improved, rather than diminished, by chatbot implementation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;E-waste take-back regulation in the United States requires producers to manage their products at the end of life. This legislation aims to stimulate product and process innovations that reduce the environmental impact of E-waste. In this study, we employ a staggered difference-in-differences approach to explore the causal relationship between state E-waste regulations and eco-innovation among producers. Our results indicate that E-waste regulations significantly boost the number of eco-patents filed by producers, with the effect intensifying as regulatory pressure increases. Additionally, our findings show that regulated producers tend to focus more on upstream resource efficiency innovations than on downstream waste management. This research offers valuable insights for policymakers and industry practitioners aiming to enhance practices for E-waste management.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online platforms that rely on voluntary user contributions face persistent challenges in maintaining sustained and active participation. This study investigates the effectiveness of a unique combination of social mechanisms—a group reputation system—in motivating individual voluntary contributions within the context of online prosocial crowdfunding. While a strong group identity can inspire member participation, the study also acknowledges a potential downside: a positive group reputation may “crowd out” individual contributions by signaling the efforts of other members. Using data collected from Kiva, we empirically examine the impact of group reputation, measured in the form of group rankings, on both overall team contributions and individual member contributions. The findings indicate that teams with higher rankings experience a decline in subsequent contributions, supporting the idea of group reputation as a public good. Further analyses explore the mechanisms driving this negative impact, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of group reputation systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Federal agencies use reverse auctions to procure cloud infrastructure services offered by major public cloud providers such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Although recent research has examined operational issues in cloud computing, these papers have not analyzed the vendor base design decisions when these cloud capacity instances are procured through the reverse auction mechanism. Therefore, several important research questions are still unaddressed. For example, how should federal clients decide on the number of cloud providers for the multi-cloud strategy? How should clients decide on private cloud capacity investments along with sourcing requirements from multiple cloud providers? We find that the client’s capacity portfolio decision is determined by factors such as vendors’ cost heterogeneity and available capacity. Specifically, we find higher cost heterogeneity leads to a smaller vendor base. Interestingly and somewhat counter-intuitively, we find that higher cost heterogeneity may increase or decrease private cloud investments. We also study the client’s decision on the type of capacity instances to be procured via reverse auctions. We find federal clients should only utilize the on-demand instances mechanism (where capacity is procured after demand realization) to fulfill the cloud computing requirements. We further observe that if vendors experience capacity outages, then the client should upfront reserve capacity instances.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the competition between two software vendors: one offering software as a service (SaaS) and the other providing on-premises software, both facing software upgrades with different customizability and implementation costs. We build a theoretical model to explore the vendor’s pricing and market segmentation strategies. We find that (1) enhancing the customizability of SaaS software does not necessarily benefit the SaaS vendor, nor does it necessarily harm the on-premises vendor, depending on the current level of the SaaS software’s customizability; (2) The SaaS vendor generally prefers pay-per-use pricing to subscription pricing because it can not only serve more consumers, but also help relieve competition pressure from the on-premises vendor; (3) Adopting a hybrid model is not necessarily profit enhancing. Specifically, while the SaaS vendor always benefits from adopting a hybrid pricing strategy, the on-premises vendor may be better off by either not offering or offering a SaaS version with limited customizability, even if it does not make sales. Nevertheless, both vendors adopting a hybrid model leads to socially efficient competition outcome, where both vendors and consumers are better off, a win-win-win scenario.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study experimentally investigates the ordering behavior of a financially constrained newsvendor‐like retailer facing stochastic demand under trade credit. Using controlled laboratory experiments, we examine the ordering behavior of a retailer procuring inventory on trade credit from the supplier under no‐bankruptcy risk (NBR) and bankruptcy risk (BR) at low‐ and high‐profit margins. Our experimental observations show deviations from normative optimality, and we find a contrast in the ordering behavior in NBR and BR settings. Compared to the respective normative optimal quantities, in the NBR setting, retailers overorder in the low‐profit margin and underorder in the high‐profit margin conditions, whereas, in the BR setting, consistent underordering is observed in both the low and high‐profit margin conditions. Next, we employ a dynamic panel regression model driven by the demand‐chasing heuristic to capture the ordering pattern. Finally, we develop a prospect theoretic model to describe the underordering behavior observed in the BR setting and find that the reference point plays a key role. Our results provide insights into the need to identify the behavior of financially constrained retailers and develop descriptive models for improved decision making.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Location-based advertising is increasingly prevalent thanks to advanced data tracking and targeting infrastructure. By combining TV ad viewership data with mobile location data of 6.4 million users, we study spatial heterogeneity in retail advertising effectiveness in the home improvement industry. The granularity of user locations that goes beyond the targeting capabilities of traditional TV ads allows us to identify spatially heterogeneous effects. Contrary to the conventional focus on radius-based targeting, we find that spatial heterogeneity is more nuanced. First, geo-competitive structure plays an important role in determining advertising effectiveness, with the proximity of a store relative to its rival serving as a significant moderator. Second, advertising effectiveness has an inverted U-shaped relationship with a customer’s distance to the store, reflecting differences in customer information. Moreover, spatial heterogeneity varies across ad types: price-promotional ads tend to influence customers closer to the store and steal rival traffic, compared to non-promotional ads. Overall, our findings offer valuable insights for location-based advertising strategies and platform targeting design.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Consumers Believe Legal Products Are Less Effective than Illegal Products</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research examines how consumers judge a product’s effectiveness based on its legal status. Across eight pre-registered experiments, we find that consumers tend to believe legal products are less effective than illegal ones. Even when observing identical, objective product outcomes (e.g., equal weight loss from a drug), consumers perceive reduced product benefits from a product described as legal (vs. illegal). We test an account of why this belief occurs. When a product is legal, consumers infer that the government allows broad access to it, which they associate with lower product strength. In contrast, illegal products, which consumers presume are harder to access, are viewed as higher in product strength. This strength inference leads consumers to believe a legal product produces smaller effects than an illegal product—both smaller positive effects (lower efficacy) and smaller negative effects (lower harm). Supporting this theory, the impact of legality on perceived efficacy is eliminated if legal and illegal products are described as equally accessible or equally strong. We further demonstrate that these beliefs influence consumer choice. Given the significant health and economic consequences of illegal product consumption, this research has important implications for consumers, marketers, public health professionals, and policymakers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While most marketing studies have focused on what salespeople say, less is known about the persuasiveness of how they say it, particularly in the distinct contexts of customer acquisition and retention. This research investigates how salespeople’s vocal brightness and loudness influence new and existing customers’ purchase behavior. Based on two studies conducted in China (a field study using a large real-world dataset of over 8,000 telephone calls and a randomized controlled experiment), the authors find that high brightness and high loudness positively predict new customers’ purchase behavior and timing, whereas low brightness and high loudness positively affect existing customers’ repurchase behavior and timing. The authors demonstrate that perceived arousal is the underlying mechanism driving customers’ purchase behavior in customer acquisition, while perceived competence serves as a mediator in customer retention. No effect of brightness or loudness on purchase volume is observed in either customer acquisition or retention. This research makes theoretical contributions to the marketing and nonverbal communication literature. It also provides valuable managerial insights regarding how to manipulate voice features to improve sales performance.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Too Many or Too Few? Information Cues in Recommender Systems and Consequences for Search and Purchase Behavior</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how the number of information cues in recommender systems influences consumer search and purchase. E-commerce platforms often display a list of recommended products on product pages, where consumers can browse and click on individual items for details. Given space constraints, determining the appropriate amount of information to display is crucial, as it affects consumers’ use of both recommender systems and non-recommender search tools. Through a field experiment with an online retailer, we test four information designs: no cues (product name only), single cues (either price or review), and dual cues (price and review). We find an inverted U-shaped relationship between the number of information cues and sales, with single cues yielding the highest sales compared to both more (dual cues) and less information (no cues). This nonlinear effect stems from the interplay between search intensity and efficiency. The no-cue condition increases search intensity but forces consumers to rely on a less efficient non-recommender search process. In contrast, the highly efficient dual-cue condition provides sufficient information for evaluation but discourages further exploration beyond recommenders. Single cues strike a balance, offering just enough information to aid product evaluation while maintaining high search intensity across both recommender and non-recommender tools.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In sectors across the experience economy—from live sports to festivals, nightlife entertainment, private members’ clubs, and invite-only events—firms compete by staging social atmospheres. When firms successfully stage social atmospheres, they benefit from enhanced customer experiences, loyalty, and place attachment. However, social atmospheres often fail when firms struggle to bring together the ‘optimal mix’ of customers. Yet marketing research offers limited insight into how firms can attract and select heterogeneous customers who fit together productively to create meaningful shared experiences of place. Accordingly, this article draws on aesthetic work literature to conceptualizesocial atmosphere curation—the process through which firms manage customer heterogeneity to achieve social fit as a means to stage social atmospheres. Through an ethnographic study of Berlin’s iconic electronic music club scene, this paper reveals a three-stage social atmosphere curation model, comprising curation mechanisms of cultivation, selection, and mystification. This research advances marketing scholarship’s understanding of social atmospheres, customer heterogeneity, and marketplace inclusion and exclusion. By outlining the managerial tasks associated with each curation mechanism, this study provides actionable guidance for managers across various service contexts on how to curate the right crowd to deliberately stage social atmospheres.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The well-established disruptive effects of employee turnover on firms have typically been attributed to post-exit dynamics, such as losses of human and social capital. Little is known, however, about leavers’ pre-exit job performance, which, if declining in sufficient magnitude as separation nears, may drive some of this disruption. Drawing on career concerns research, we argue that impending exit weakens incentives to improve future career prospects at the firm, thereby resulting in reduced performance. Our analysis reveals strikingly large negative relationships, as job performance during the impending-exit period declines by 53.9% and 79.8% across two performance measures. Additionally, we predict and find that these performance decrements are more pronounced for junior-level employees and partially mitigated for those anticipating a continuing relationship with the organization after exit. We test our predictions using longitudinal data on 4,104 patent examiners who left the United States Patent and Trademark Office from 2001 to 2018.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this editorial, we discuss and define the “future of work” as a phenomenon and research area, and outline avenues for further research at the conceptual and empirical level. We first offer a brief review of the different streams of research that study the future of work, both in management and organization studies and in adjacent fields. We then elaborate on what we see as the most promising avenues for research on the future of work, organized around five questions of what, when, who, how, and why. That is, research on the future of work needs to clarify its assumptions about (1) the phenomena it considers within scope; (2) the temporality associated with these phenomena; (3) which future of work actors it is about and whom it is for; (4) the methods and data types used to be able to study the future empirically; and (5) desired impact and envisioned outcomes. We discuss how moving beyond techno-determinism, depoliticization, and a present-day focus could open up new and important avenues for further research on the near and distant future of work. We conclude with some specific examples of research questions and methods.</content>

    <title>A Study of Ride-Hailing Platforms’ Business Models in the Presence of Surge Demand</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractThis study analyzes whether a ride-hailing platform should adopt a closed business model, that is, serving riders only with platform-owned vehicles, or an open business model, that is, allowing private vehicles to utilize the platform to provide services. Analytical results reveal that the open business model leads to more service supply (supply-augmenting effect) and a lower price increase (price discrimination–hindering effect) in the surge period, both benefiting riders. It also reduces the number of idle vehicles in the normal period, thus resulting in more efficient utilization of vehicle resources. Interestingly, the platform does not always benefit from adopting the open business model. In sum, the open business model always benefits the riders, private drivers, and the society as a whole, but it may not be more profitable for the platform. This interesting result calls for policymakers to incentivize the platform so that it adopts the open business model instead of the closed one.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impact of uncertainty on optimal contracting in a multidivisional firm. Headquarters contract with division managers to induce effort. Uncertainty creates endogenous disagreement, thereby aggravating moral hazard. By hedging uncertainty, headquarters design incentive contracts that reduce disagreement and lower incentive provision costs, thereby promoting effort. Because hedging uncertainty can conflict with hedging risk, optimal contracts differ from those in standard principal-agent models. Our model helps explain the prevalence of equity-based incentive contracts and the rarity of relative-performance contracts, especially in firms facing greater uncertainty. (JEL G12, G31)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that implied volatility (IV) curves of short-term equity options frequently become concave prior to earnings announcements day (EAD), typically reflecting a bimodal risk-neutral distribution for the underlying stock price. Firms with concave IV curves exhibit significantly higher absolute stock returns on EAD and higher realized volatility after the announcement, rendering concavity an ex-ante signal for event risk. Returns on delta-neutral straddles, delta-neutral strangles, and delta- and vega-neutral calendar straddles are negative and significantly lower in the presence of concave IV curves, showing that investors pay a substantial premium to hedge against the gamma risk arising from this event.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many auctions and procurement contests entail non-trivial bidding costs, which makes the bidders’ participation decisions endogenous to the auction design. We analyse the effect of different auction rules on potential bidders’ incentives to participate. We focus on first-price auctions with affiliated common values and a large pool of potential bidders. Our main interest is on auctions where the realized number of bidders is unknown at the bidding stage. In contrast to the standard case, both participation and bidding decisions are often non-monotonic in the symmetric equilibrium of our model. The expected revenue to the seller is often higher in the auction where the realized number of participating bidders is not disclosed.</content>

    <title>The Role of Reviewer Characteristics on the Diversity of Successful Applicants</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In their efforts to foster diversity and talent, organizations, banks, and venture capitalists utilize the expertise of reviewers to evaluate applications from a broad range of applicants. Reviewers make decisions under different types of cognitive load, such as the necessity to aggregate complex information and workload pressure. To cope with the stress, reviewers might use automatic biases to make decisions faster, which can result in lower organizational diversity. We explore the characteristics of reviewers in a particular setting—patent applications at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). We leverage quasi-exogenous variation from the random assignment of patent examiners, allowing us to find the causal impact of applicant gender and examiner characteristics on the application success rate. We find evidence that applicants with more female-sounding names have a 3.6-percentage-point lower likelihood of patent approval. We find that a high workload of the examiner leads to a decrease in the likelihood that the patent application of a female inventor would be approved, consistent with theories on coping strategies when experiencing cognitive load. Our results extend to applications filed by teams of inventors. These results suggest that it is essential to manage the stress related to reviewers’ workloads to guarantee a variety of successful candidates.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17910 .</content>

    <title>Does a Theory-of-Value Add Value? Evidence from a Randomized Control Trial with Tanzanian Entrepreneurs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs making decisions under uncertainty are encouraged to evaluate their initial ideas through hypothesis testing, but entrepreneurial approaches vary in their emphasis on ex-ante theory development prior to collecting evidence. In this paper, we examine whether and how entrepreneurs benefit from adopting an evidence-based approach or a theory-and-evidence-based approach to decision making. We conducted a field experiment with Tanzanian agribusiness entrepreneurs by randomly assigning entrepreneurs to two different training conditions. We find that entrepreneurs in the theory-and-evidence–based condition have higher economic performance during the observation period following the intervention. We conjecture this result stems from differences in the types of changes enacted: entrepreneurs in the theory-and-evidence–based training make more coordinated changes that encompass both core and operational elements of their business models.Funding: This work was supported by the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research [Grant DFs-18-0000000008], the Rockefeller Foundation [Grant 2018 FOD 004], and Ed Snider Center for Enterprise and Markets.

    <title>Let Us Not Speak of Them, But Look and Pass? Organizational Responses to Online Reviews</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a world where five stars have become the standard for evaluating many transactions and consumers turn to the crowd for guidance when making a wide variety of choices, organizations cannot dismiss online reviews as inconsequential. And whereas we know a lot about how organizations respond to reviews online, there has been a lack of systematic evidence showing how organizations behave in response to online feedback once their screens are turned off. This paper leverages a novel combination of insights from a lab-in-the-field experiment, an archival study, and two rounds of qualitative interviews in the French restaurant industry to examine online and offline responses to reviewer feedback. We identify characteristics of the review, the restaurant, and the respondent that influenced when restaurants in our sample were more likely to align their actions online and offline and when they were more likely to decouple them—that is, posting an online response promising to take corrective action while having no intention to change how the restaurant operates “in real life.” We conclude by speculating on potential mechanisms behind our respondents’ reactions and discussing our contribution to the literature on producer reactivity and the symbolic management of change.Funding: This work was supported by Università Bocconi, Labex Ecodec, and Fondation HEC.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2020.14091 .</content>

    <title>Correction to “How Does Financial‐Reporting Regulation Affect Industry‐Wide Resource Allocation?”</title>

      <name>Matthias Breuer</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This correction describes errors in the program code of Breuer [2021] and presents revised results. The errors affect the construction of the standardized reporting and auditing scopes, the treatment variables of the primary research design in Breuer [2021]. The revised results show weaker evidence that reporting mandates facilitate ownership dispersion in capital markets compared to Breuer [2021]. They also show weaker evidence that reporting mandates spur competition in product markets, including mixed evidence on product‐market entry. Consistent with Breuer [2021], the revised results continue to show no unambiguous evidence that reporting mandates improve the efficiency of industry‐wide resource allocation. With respect to audit mandates, the revised results continue to show evidence that the mandates impose a barrier to entry. Overall, the correction indicates that the impacts of reporting and auditing mandates are even more uncertain than reported in Breuer [2021] and that further research on these impacts is called for.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: A Blessing or a Curse: the Impact of Sampling in Crowdfunding Market</title>
    <updated>2025-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The crowdfunding market has developed fast in recent years. However, the problem of information asymmetry is still an issue for both backers and fundraisers. Hence, crowdfunding platforms design various policies to reveal more project information to backers. This paper studies the impact of product sampling, a novel policy in the crowdfunding market, and provides suggestive evidence of the underlying mechanism. A product sampling campaign can be divided into three stages chronologically. InApplication Stage, backers can apply for free samples. InTrial Stage, users of free samples experience them, but no feedback reports are available. InReport Stage, at least one feedback report is published, and backers can refer to reports when making decisions. Leveraging a rich data set from a large online crowdfunding platform in China, we construct a structural model considering both the demand and supply sides of the market. We use a consideration set model to characterize the fact that backers cannot notice all projects on the crowdfunding platform. We find that sampling campaigns raise the awareness of backers on sampling projects in all stages. However, inTrial Stage, backers’ utility of supporting the project declines, which is most likely to be attributed to backers’ strategic delay waiting for valuable feedback reports. We also find that the scores of feedback reports and the number of free samples offered serve as effective quality signals of projects. These two signals largely determine how backers’ utility changes inReport Stage. Moreover, our counterfactual analysis shows that the demand for most projects rises inApplication Stagebut falls inTrial Stage, and half of the projects see a demand increase inReport Stagewhile the other half experience a decrease. Our research strives to uncover the underlying mechanisms of product sampling in the crowdfunding market, makes methodological contributions, and provides meaningful managerial implications for fundraisers and crowdfunding platforms.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze how a profit‐maximizing proxy advisor designs vote recommendations and research reports. The advisor benefits from producing informative, unbiased reports, but only partially informative recommendations, biased against the a priori likely alternative. Such recommendations induce close votes, increasing controversy and thereby the relevance and value of proxy advice. Our results suggest shifting from an exclusive emphasis on recommendations, highlighting the importance of both reports and recommendations in proxy advisors' information provision. They rationalize the one‐size‐fits‐all approach and help reinterpret empirical patterns of voting behavior, suggesting that proxy advisors' recommendations may not be a suitable benchmark for evaluating shareholders' votes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Large Language Models have been incorporated into an astounding breadth of professional domains. Given their capabilities, many intellectual laborers naturally question to what extent these AI models will be able to usurp their own jobs. As behavioral scientists, we performed an effort to examine the extent to which an AI can performourroles. To achieve this, we utilized commercially available AIs (e.g., ChatGPT 4) to perform each step of the research process, culminating in an AI‐written manuscript. We attempted to intervene as little as possible in the AI‐led idea generation, empirical testing, analysis, and reporting. This allowed us to assess the limits of AIs in a behavioral research context and propose guidelines for behavioral researchers wanting to utilize AI. We found that the AIs were adept at some parts of the process and wholly inadequate at others. Our overall recommendation is that behavioral researchers use AIs judiciously and carefully monitor the outputs for quality and coherence. We additionally draw implications for editorial teams, doctoral student training, and the broader research ecosystem.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Below are comments on Tomaino, Cooke, and Hoover by four teams of collaborative reviewers that helped clarify and focus its original version. Their comments on the refined version articulate how the fast‐moving world of generative AI can alter authors, readers, reviewers, and consumer behavior journals. In the first comment, Blythe, Kulis, and McGraw propose that Generative AI requires substantial effort to generate research that is fast, cost‐effective, and of high quality. They articulate three recommendations: to ask, to train, and to check the system.Askingbuilds on GenAI's ability to reveal its own capabilities at different stages of the research process.Trainingallows the system to be customized with relevant context, domain‐specific documents, and tailored examples, enhancing its accuracy and reducing errors.Checkingis strongly advised to validate that the outputs are both reasonable and robust. Haenlein, Hewett, and Yoo build on the capabilities of Large Language Models that go beyond the research practices central to consumer psychology. They outline strategic prompting strategies: starting broadly and gradually narrowing to specific domains, downloading information from relevant articles and data that is unlikely to be part of the current corpus, and evoking specific theories, methods, or presentation formats. They also elaborate on the ways the apparent magic of GenAI may raise learning or ethical challenges. The third comment by Stacy Wood focuses less on the capabilities of GenAI and more on how its adoption will depend on researcher feelings—in other words, how different aspects of its use may alter researchers' experiences of doing research and their identities as scholars. GenAI has the potential to both build (through increased productivity or increased accessibility) and limit (through loss of agency or faster production) pride of purpose in research. She argues that feelings from using GenAI are likely to differ across research steps, from developing novel concepts, processes, analyses, and writing of the paper. Wherever GenAI may lessen the excitement, satisfaction, motivation, and perceived status of the researcher, barriers to its use are likely to be erected. Finally, Vicki Morwitz identifies new AI capabilities beyond those explored in Tomaino et al. Those include the ability to generate synthetic data that can guide empirical experiments, a facility to create audio and visual stimuli, a capability to study group behavior, and a capacity to reliably interpret complex human statements. The comment then closes with important questions for editorial policies, raising issues about limitations on AI use by authors, its appropriate applications by review teams, and possible publishers' restrictions on uploading copyrighted articles.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations are increasingly introducing artificial intelligence (AI) into the workplace and encouraging employees to use AI to complete work. Correspondingly, research on AI usage predominantly focuses on the positive effects of AI usage on employees themselves. Drawing upon attribution theory and AI literature and taking an interpersonal perspective, this research challenges the prevailing consensus by investigating whether, when, and how employee AI usage would lead to negative coworker outcomes. We propose that when coworkers attribute employee AI usage as a way to slack off (i.e., slack attribution), employee AI usage is negatively related to coworkers' perceived morality of the employee, which in turn decreases coworkers' helping behavior toward the employee. Two experimental studies, a field survey study, and a field experiment provide substantial support for our hypotheses. This research adds new insights into the AI usage literature by revealing the negative coworker outcomes of employee AI usage.</content>

    <title>Peer Influence in the Workplace: The Moderating Role of Task Structures Within Organizations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Peer influence is crucial in shaping work practices within organizations, yet the impact of formal organizational structures on this influence remains underexplored. We argue that task structures, which capture how tasks are allocated and configured within organizations, significantly affect peer interactions and influence. Specifically, we examine how two features of task structures—task variety and task similarity with peers—moderate peer influence in a highly consequential setting: physicians’ decisions to perform a birth via caesarean section (C-section) versus vaginal delivery. Using data on nearly 5 million births performed by more than 16,500 physicians across 915 hospitals in Brazil, we find that working alongside peers whose practice style (enduring preference) favors C-sections leads the focal physician to perform more C-sections, even after controlling for features of the mother and the pregnancy. This influence is significantly stronger for physicians with higher task variety and with higher task similarity with peers. Through post-hoc analyses, we provide evidence that the observed behaviors are consistent with a mechanism of information sharing between physicians. This study contributes to our understanding of peer influence in the workplace by showing how the task structure within organizations can either amplify or diminish peer influence. This awareness is particularly crucial for health care organizations in which such dynamics can have life-changing consequences.</content>

    <title>Incumbent response to business model innovation: The role of &lt;scp&gt;CEO&lt;/scp&gt; opportunity framing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore how CEO sensegiving through framing influences incumbent firm response to business model innovation. Our historical analysis of Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble (B&amp;N) in the US bookselling industry after the entry of Amazon.com reveals that although both CEOs framed Amazon's entry as an opportunity, they did so in strikingly different ways. Their opportunity framing differed on four dimensions—intensity, concreteness, future orientation, and inclusiveness—closely associated with specific patterns in the respective incumbent's response: separation between the old and new business model for Borders and blending of the old and new models for B&amp;N. Our study highlights the role of multidimensional and sustained opportunity framing for blending actions contributing to business model innovation in established firms over time.Managerial SummaryWhat role do CEOs play in how established firms react to new entrants with innovative business models? We examined how the CEOs at B&amp;N and Borders framed the opportunity provided by the new online business model introduced by Amazon and found significant differences in their framing that influenced how the two firms adapted to it. The more intense, concrete, future‐oriented, and inclusive framing by B&amp;N's top managers contributed to a successful blending of the traditional store‐based and the new online model, while at Borders the business models were kept separate. Our study shows the importance of multidimensional and sustained framing of digital opportunities over time for the successful integration of new business models.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how the development ofvoluntarysustainability standards has affected the nature of information covered in earnings calls. Using industry-specific dictionaries of sustainability terms contained in the disclosure standards developed by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), we find an increase in coverage of sustainability topics identified as relevant to investors in SASB standards, particularly for companies that had little or no coverage of sustainability issues historically. This trend begins around the time when SASB released aprovisionalstandard for a given company’s industry and continues in the years afterward. We also find a stronger effect of SASB standards on conference call content for companies operating in industries with greater ex ante uncertainty about which sustainability topics are more likely to be financially material. Overall, our paper provides timely evidence as jurisdictions around the world consider whether to support sustainability reporting in their capital markets and, if so, how.</content>

    <title>Blurring Boundaries in Coworker Relationships: How a Nonwork Setting Becomes a Relational Holding Environment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Positive work relationships often emerge when coworkers blur the boundaries of their work and nonwork lives in their interactions. A growing body of scholarship suggests that such boundary blurring increasingly occurs in a variety of nonwork settings. However, existing research has drawn mixed conclusions about whether boundary-blurring interactions in nonwork settings lead to beneficial or detrimental outcomes for coworker relationships. Through an inductive study of users of the exercise platform Peloton, we build theory on how and why a nonwork interaction setting facilitates work-nonwork boundary blurring that leads to positive work relationships. Our findings demonstrate that informants perceive Peloton as having a unique set of characteristics that filters out the discomfort of interacting with coworkers in a nonwork setting and provides them with new ways of understanding the potential of their coworker relationships. These two processes enable Peloton to function as a relational holding environment or — a social context that reduces uncomfortable relational affect and facilitates relational sensemaking. Experiencing Peloton as a relational holding environment motivates informants to deepen their existing positive relationships and forge a broader set of positive relationships across work-related silos. Our theory advances scholarship on work-nonwork boundaries, positive work relationships, and the psychodynamic literature on holding environments. It also has important implications for how managers and employees navigate social contexts to facilitate positive work relationships.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Efficiently Computed Periodic Ordering Heuristics in Stochastic Distribution SystemsThe difficulty of analyzing and optimizing the stochastic one-warehouse multiretailer problem under the (S,T) policy motivates the need to consider approximate but high-fidelity models that are easier to scrutinize. In “Heuristic (S,T) Solutions via an FPTAS for a One-Warehouse Multiretailer Problem,” Najy, Elbassioni, and Diabat show how to efficiently compute competitive solutions for such systems based on an approximate formulation of the inventory problem proposed by Chu and Shen (2010) and build on the assumption of power-of-two (POT) policies. The authors first devise a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the continuous relaxation of the model and then show how to round it to a POT solution within an improved approximation factor relative to the present literature. These solutions are shown via simulation to be highly competitive with optimal (S,T) solutions and are derived in a tiny fraction of the time needed by the current best (S,T) algorithms.</content>

    <title>Contextual Data-Integrated Newsvendor Solution with Operational Data Analytics (ODA)</title>
    <updated>2025-03-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the data-integrated newsvendor problem in which the random demand depends on a set of covariates. Observing from the solutions analyzed in the existing studies, we identify the equivariant class of operational statistics (i.e., the mapping from the demand and covariate data to the inventory decision) to develop the operational data analytics (ODA) framework for the contextual newsvendor problem. The equivariant property is intuitively appealing, and it is justified by the fact that, regardless of the sample size, no other decision rule can uniformly dominate the optimal operational statistic within the equivariant class. We also demonstrate that nonequivariant solutions can produce unstable empirical performance with limited samples, whereas equivariant solutions exhibit robustness. When the distribution family of the demand is known but the coefficients of the demand function are unknown, we can directly validate the decision performance of operational statistics within the equivariant class and derive the uniformly optimal solution. When the distribution family of the demand is unknown, we formulate the data integration model as a subclass of equivariant operational statistics, obtained through adaptively boosting some candidate solution. For decision validation, we project the validation data to the demand for the covariates of interests, and the projection is constructed by utilizing the structure of the candidate solution. We demonstrate the superior small-sample performance of adaptive boosting and establish the consistency of the boosted operational statistics. Our ODA formulation, building on the inherent characteristics of the contextual newsvendor problem, highlights the importance of understanding structural properties in data-integrated decision making.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04164 .</content>

    <title>Incentivizing Blockchain Participation Through Task Assignment Mechanisms: Evidence From a Natural Experiment of Consensus Protocols on Ethereum</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how task assignment mechanisms affect the participation of workers on decentralized blockchains. In developing the theory, I highlight that blockchain represents a distinct organizational form for coordinating operations under a highly decentralized structure, in which the essential tasks of system infrastructure maintenance are assigned to third‐party crowd workers through the unique governance mechanism of consensus protocol. I specifically focus on two widely adopted consensus protocols in the context of cryptocurrency, namely, proof‐of‐work (PoW), which assigns tasks that sustain the blockchain system operation based on workers' investments in computing power, and proof‐of‐stake (PoS), which assigns these tasks based on workers' investments in the native cryptocurrency as stakes. I argue that compared with PoW, PoS increases worker participation and task decentralization because the investment requirement of task participation in the form of blockchain native assets reduces workers' transaction costs in task contracting and their tendencies for hyper‐competition. My empirical analysis leverages a natural experiment on Ethereum, namely, the “Merge” event on September 15, 2022, in which the blockchain changed the assignment rules by switching the consensus protocol from PoW to PoS. The results under a difference‐in‐differences research design confirm my arguments.</content>

    <title>Institutional Logics and the Post‐Financing Relationship Between Investors and Entrepreneurs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How the investor–entrepreneur relationship can be better managed and maintained during the post‐financing stage is a central question for investors and entrepreneurs alike, particularly given the large numbers of failed new venture collaborations. Extant research has generally underexplored the two‐sided nature of this process, which requires both investors and entrepreneurs to opt in, while treating the norms and values underlying such behaviours as relatively homogeneous. Drawing on the institutional logics perspective, this study offers an alternative framework to explain the effective maintaining of the crucial investor–entrepreneur relationship. This framework suggests that a similarity in the two parties' institutional logics will facilitate the formation of aligned motives and shared perceptions between investors and entrepreneurs, which helps to maintain the relationship. Moreover, the interaction foundation provided by logic similarity is situated in context, and its activation depends on investment‐ and context‐specific stimuli that can influence investors and entrepreneurs' interpretation and choice of appropriate behaviour. Empirical analyses of 2052 deals made by 1032 investors in 382 portfolio firms during the period 2000–2018 in high‐tech industries in China provide general support for these arguments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This registered report investigates self‐directed retail investors' information choices and trading decisions on an integrated trading platform that provides timely and convenient access to accounting information. The analyses reveal that these investors access a mosaic of information, with a high proportion not firm‐specific. In accessing accounting disclosures, retail investors are more interested in media articles providing summaries or expert analyses than original filings. Retail trades on this integrated trading platform are more informed than another retail trading platform providing little information services while exhibiting no significant differences in informativeness compared with institutional trades usingBulge Bracketplatforms. In particular, trade informativeness is more pronounced when there are accounting disclosures. The evidence suggests that self‐directed retail investors can benefit from a trading environment that provides rich and convenient access to a mosaic of information, particularly timely accounting disclosures.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present a dynamic model of information acquisition and disclosure. The manager seeks to maximize future stock prices and collects information privately about the firm's fundamentals. Information acquisition increases the arrival rate of private information. The manager can choose to disclose his private information or withhold it in perpetuity. We study the impact of information acquisition on the accumulation of private information, disclosure, and the firm's initial investment.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using consumer complaints filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as a measure for the quality of financial products and services, we present evidence of racial disparities in the service quality received by consumers. Consumers in high‐minority communities file more complaints than those in low‐minority communities, and the racial gap in financial complaints increased by more than 60% during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Using a triple‐difference approach, we establish the role of corporate social attitudes, reflected in, for example, inclusive promotion practices and diversity in leadership, in mitigating the complaint racial gap and its pandemic‐period increase. Our results shed light on how inclusive corporate culture filters through an organization to benefit minority communities and underscore the effect of corporate social attitudes on important stakeholder outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Drawing on the organizational identification perspective, this paper proposes that employee‐friendly workplace practices can positively impact employees' innovation productivity through their identification with the organization. Using a sample of 2642 firm‐year observations from public firms in the United States, a positive relationship was found between employee‐friendly workplace practices and employee innovation productivity, which was mediated by identification with the organization. The results also showed that the employee professional human capital dampened the relationship between employee‐friendly workplace practices and employee innovation productivity. Finally, the mediated relationship between employee‐friendly workplace practices and employees' innovation productivity through organizational identification was moderated by employees' professional human capital, such as when employees are credentialed knowledge workers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a tractable dynamic contracting framework to study bank bail-in regimes. In the presence of a repeated monitoring problem, the optimal bank capital structure combines standard debt, which induces liquidation and provides strong incentives, and bail-in debt, which restores solvency but provides weaker incentives. Given fire sales, an optimal policy response entails joint regulation: a bail-in regime reduces standard debt while leverage regulation reduces total debt. Bail-ins replace bailouts as a recapitalization tool. (JEL G28, G33)</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide evidence that dividend-paying stocks are less exposed to return extrapolation than non-dividend-paying stocks. In particular, social media sentiment and analyst price targets of dividend-paying stocks are significantly less sensitive to past returns. Our findings indicate that this difference stems from price changes playing a larger role in extrapolation and dividends diverting attention away from price changes for dividend-paying stocks. Consistent with models of return extrapolation, dividend-paying stocks earn lower momentum and long-term reversal returns. The value premium, however, is similar among both groups. Collectively, our findings suggest that return extrapolation is an important source of some anomaly returns.</content>

    <title>Typical Ranges as Scale-Specific Benchmarks: When and Why Percentages Amplify Relative Magnitudes and Their Differences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Business managers and policymakers must often communicate magnitudes. Yet conveying large relative magnitudes without desensitizing people to further increases can be challenging because of diminishing sensitivity to large numbers. In this research, we propose that percentage expressions not only make large relative magnitudes (e.g., 500%) appear larger than equivalent non-percentage expressions but also make large increases in relative magnitudes (e.g., from 500% to 600%) appear larger. We posit an explanation: percentages typically have values between 0% and 100%, so when percentages and percentage-point differences reach 100% or more, they seem unusually large. This hypothesis is supported by data scraped from New York Times articles and a series of online experiments employing both management-relevant scenarios and incentive-compatible decisions. Existing theories of magnitude perception either cannot predict all the results of these studies (e.g., numerosity and unitosity) or need further specification to do so (e.g., decision-by-sampling and range-frequency theory). We discuss implications for the theory of magnitude and difference perception and the practice of communicating large magnitudes and changes.This paper was accepted by Yuval Rottenstreich, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02646 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Customer preferences for product features play an important role in designing successful goods and services. Preferences for features are typically obtained by utilizing a model of choice where the utility for all but one level of an attribute is estimable. That is, the traditional discrete choice model can provide information on the change in utility between attribute-levels, but cannot separately estimate the utility associated with all levels of an attribute. In this paper, we propose a model that integrates conjoint and Maximum Difference scaling data to identify part-worth utilities for all product features, using the outside good as a common reference level, instead of the usual practice of having a reference level for each product attribute. The preference data are also integrated with satisfaction data to identify market opportunities for new and existing products. We illustrate our model with data from a survey measuring customer satisfaction and preferences for large-screen TVs.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02560 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media platforms aggressively compete for the participants who create content on their sites. In this study, we delve into one tactic of this competition that has become increasingly popular but received limited scholarly attention—the extension of length limits (i.e., the maximum number of characters in a post)—and how it affects both the production and consumption of social media posts. We investigate these questions by exploiting a natural experiment, the phased rollout of length limit extensions on a leading Chinese microblog platform. Findings suggest that extending length limits significantly increased the number of daily posts of individual users. However, and strikingly, only already active users appear to post more after the extension with little observed change from less active users. Further, results show that extending length limits increases the number of likes each post receives, indicating that extensions improve content quality and may increase engagement in the long term. This suggests that, by permitting longer posts, social media platforms can facilitate engagement from both the post generators and audiences (at least in terms of likes). However, findings also suggest that extending length limits risks further concentrating content generation from the vocal minority, thereby making the silent majority less visible on the platforms.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03629 .</content>

    <title>What Do Content Moderators Do? Emotion Work and Control on a Digital Health Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Content moderation determines the type of data displayed on platforms. Although this type of work is conducted online without interpersonal interactions, it does not remain emotionless. This article presents findings from a longitudinal qualitative study of how content moderation is conducted on a UK‐based platform that publishes patients' stories of their health experiences. Drawing upon the literatures on emotion work in organizations and on content moderation, this paper addresses the questions: what is the nature of emotion work that is undertaken during content moderation and how does emotion work play out with control on online platforms? Although management studies have made extensive contributions to platform work, content moderation remains under‐theorized, despite its significance in determining the type of information platforms exhibit. The paper contributes theoretically and empirically to this field in three ways. First, it categorizes the work practices moderators undertake on a health platform, which encompass application of rules, quantification, objectification, verification, and care. Second, our paper shows that content moderation is constitutive of emotion work and goes on to identify various types of emotion work, including managed and unmanaged authentic emotions. Third, our paper offers a model that illustrates how emotion work constitutes a sense‐making mechanism that allows moderators to exercise discretion and undertake care work, bypassing the prescriptive regulatory environment of content moderation, and sourcing occasional autonomy.</content>

    <title>Manufacturing national consent for industrial policy: a microhistorical analysis of Finnish shipbuilding</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Industrial policy, the use of state power to influence the development of industries, has become increasingly influential in international business, yet its firm-level dynamics remain understudied. Through a history-to-theory approach and microhistorical analysis, we investigate how the Finnish shipbuilding industry employed nonmarket strategies (NMS) to influenceoutward-orientedindustrial policies that supported its international expansion. Grounded in New Institutional Economics, we identify two key industrial policy shifts – in the mid-1950s and early 1980s – that reduced cross-border transaction costs for Finnish shipbuilders to enhance their international competitiveness. Before each shift, the industry proactively aligned its business interests with national policy priorities, engaging in what we term “manufacturing national consent” – positioning the sector as critical to national interests to legitimize supportive policies. We critically assess the double-edged role of NMS in industrial policy, demonstrating that while it creates regulatory capture and hinders alternative economic pathways, it also fosters government–business collaboration, improving the prospects of effective policy design. We further account for country-specific factors and broader inter-country dynamics to analyze policy implications for home-country firms. In all, our study contributes to the revitalization of industrial policy as a topic in the IB discipline by uncovering the active role of firms in shaping policy outcomes.</content>

    <title>Collusion in Brokered Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;High commissions in the U.S. residential real estate agency market pose a puzzle for economic theory because brokerage is not a concentrated industry. We model brokered markets as a game in which agents post prices for customers and then choose which other agents to work with. We show that there exists an equilibrium in which each agent conditions working with other agents on those agents' posted prices. Prices can therefore be meaningfully higher than the competitive level (for a fixed discount factor), regardless of the number of agents. Thus, brokered markets can remain uncompetitive even with low concentration and easy entry.</content>
