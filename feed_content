    <title>Competitive overlap as a signal in expert partner choice: Evidence from patent law firm selection</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In market networks, firms regularly seek partners with needed expertise, but these partners often work with the firms' competitors. How such second‐order competitive overlap affects partner selection is unclear. Prior theory assumes firms view networks as “pipes” and emphasizes flows of competitor information via the shared partner as key in partner selection. We propose that firms also view networks as “prisms” and use competitive overlap as a signal of a potential partner's expertise. Hence, firms may prefer partners with competitive overlap. We find support for our claims in the patent law firm selection context. Furthermore, higher competitive overlap leads to slower patent acceptance but results in broader patents, implying that the competitive overlap expertise signal reduces search costs without significant performance loss.Managerial SummaryWhen selecting expert partners like law firms or consultants, some companies may consider avoiding firms that also serve their competitor. However, when little is known about potential partners, this “competitive overlap” might be a way to assess their quality. We found that firms are more likely to choose patent law firms who work with their competitors. This occurs because a competitor's choice signals that partner's expertise. Companies rely on this signal most when they lack direct experience with potential partners or when entering new technological domains. While working with partners who serve competitors might slightly increase processing times, it can increase patent protection without compromising overall performance. These findings suggest that avoiding partners based solely on competitive overlap may limit access to valuable expertise.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the effects of the largest residential racial desegregation initiative in U.S. history, the Gautreaux Assisted Housing Program. From the late 1970s to the 1990s, Gautreaux moved thousands of Black families into predominantly white neighborhoods to support racial and economic integration. We link historical program records to administrative data and use plausibly exogenous variation in neighborhood placements to study how desegregating moves impact children in the long-run. Being placed in the predominantly white neighborhoods targeted by the program significantly increases children’s future lifetime earnings and wealth. These moves also increase the likelihood of marriage and particularly raise the probability of being married to a white spouse. Moreover, placements through Gautreaux impact neighborhood choices in adulthood. Those placed in predominantly white neighborhoods during childhood live in more racially diverse areas with higher rates of upward mobility nearly 40 years later.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We exploit within-firm variations in plant-level toxic releases to examine the effect of managerial hometown preference on corporate environmental policies. We find that pollution levels are about 30% lower for plants located near chief executive officers’ (CEOs’) hometowns. This reduction is achieved through resource-intensive pollution control efforts, including source reduction and waste management activities. Analyses using CEO turnover provide causal inferences. Local residents benefit from CEO hometown pollution reduction as localities hosting more hometown plants experience improved environmental conditions and better residential health outcomes. On the other hand, some evidence suggests that CEOs’ hometown preference is related to agency frictions. Overall, our findings reveal the impact of CEOs’ personal motivations on corporate pollution dynamics and their consequential effects on the well-being of local communities.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: Q.

    <title>City Digitalization and Corporate Financial Fraud: An Information Asymmetry Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One pivotal driver of corporate financial fraud is the information asymmetry between cooperative executives and external stakeholders. We propose that city‐level digitalization can mitigate such information asymmetry and deter financial fraud of local firms. Using panel data from listed firms and archival data in China, we find that city digitalization is negatively associated with the incidence of corporate financial fraud. However, this association is weaker in regions with high bureaucratic corruption but is stronger for firms with low corporate social responsibility scores. Further mediating analyses show that city digitalization reduces information asymmetry between local firms and the market and in turn decreases financial fraud incidence. Overall, our research sheds novel light on the governance role of city digitalization and highlights the significance of complementarity between various governance components.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show a negative effect of opioid prescriptions on subsequent individual employment among employers in our sample using doctor-opioid-prescribing propensity as our instrument. This finding has implications for firms that must now contend with lower local labor supply. We find a negative relationship between opioid prescriptions and subsequent establishment growth. However, firms respond to labor shortages by investing more in technology, replacing the relatively scarcer labor with capital, especially when they are not financially constrained. We find positive abnormal returns, upon the passage of state laws intended to limit opioid prescriptions, that are driven by firms more reliant on labor. (JEL J21, G31, 033)</content>

    <title>Are U.S. GAAP-based and IFRS-based accounting amounts more comparable after the revised lease standards? Evidence from ASC 842 and IFRS 16</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines whether the revised lease standards (ASC 842 and IFRS 16) make U.S. GAAP-based accounting amounts more comparable with IFRS-based accounting amounts. Our study is motivated by the FASB and the IASB’s call for research on the comparability of the revised lease standards. We find that U.S. GAAP and IFRS pairs that are high operating lease users experience a larger increase in accounting comparability after the adoption of revised lease standards than low operating lease U.S. GAAP-IFRS pairs. Additionally, our results suggest that the improvement comes more from the changes to the balance sheet rather than the income statement and is more pronounced for IFRS firms from countries with stronger accounting enforcement. Lastly, we show that analysts who are more GAAP-focused (IFRS-focused) prior to the standard change are more likely to increase their forecasting of book value per share for IFRS (U.S. GAAP) firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Rapid technological developments in online markets fundamentally change the relationship between consumers and sellers. Online platforms can easily gather data about consumers’ search behavior, allowing for price discrimination. Therefore, product search becomes a strategic choice. Consumers face a tradeoff: Search intensely and receive a better fit at a potentially higher price or restrict search behavior, be strategically inattentive, and receive a worse fit but maybe a better deal. We study the resulting strategic buyer-seller interaction theoretically and experimentally. Our experimental results shed a critical light on the added value for consumers through the rise of online platforms and on the effectiveness of current regulations.This paper has been This paper was accepted by Elena Katok for the Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: This work was supported by the ZEW–Leibniz-Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung, and the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03413 .</content>

    <title>The Effect of On-the-Job Experience on Base-Rate Neglect: Evidence from Medical Professionals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effect of on-the-job experience on base-rate neglect, which is a common bias in assessing conditional probabilities. We do so by carrying out experiments with medical professionals, who are routinely exposed to conditional-probability problems in the form of diagnostic tests, and nonmedical professionals, who are not. As such, medical workers with more years of experience will have had more exposure to base-rate type problems than nonmedical workers with similar years of experience. We estimate the effect of on-the-job experience by comparing the answers of more or less experienced professionals in both the medical and nonmedical domains. Although the incidence of the bias is high for both groups and all levels of experience, we find that more experienced medical workers (a) have lower rates of perfect base-rate neglect (i.e., completely ignoring the base rates), (b) provide more accurate posterior estimates, and (c) adjust their estimates more in response to changes in the base rates. We observe no such difference for nonmedical workers. We conduct a number of robustness checks and consider possible mechanisms, such as education, job or survey attrition, selectivity into medical professions, and experience with false positives. Our results suggests that on-the-job experience mitigates, but does not eliminate, base-rate neglect.This paper was accepted by Lauren Cohen, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Lehigh University [FRG Grant].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05461 .</content>

    <title>All the Lonely People: An Integrated Review and Research Agenda on Work and Loneliness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Decades of studies spanning multiple disciplines have provided insight into the critical role of loneliness in work contexts. In spite of this extensive research, a comprehensive review of loneliness and work remains absent. To address this gap, we conducted a multidisciplinary review of relevant theory and research and identified 213 articles reporting on 233 empirical studies from management, organizational psychology, sociology, medicine, and other domains to uncover why people feel lonely, how different features of work can contribute to feelings of loneliness, and the implications of employee loneliness for organizational settings. This enabled a critical examination of the distinct conceptualizations and operationalizations of loneliness that have been advanced and the theories underpinning this scholarship. We developed a comprehensive conceptual model that integrates cognitive discrepancy theory, the affect theory of social exchange, and evolutionary theory. This model elucidates the core antecedents, mediators, outcomes, moderators, and interventions forming the nomological network of work related loneliness, including cross-level influences within teams and among leaders. Our review also identifies a number of promising areas for future inquiry to improve our understanding and measurement of loneliness, the process of experiencing and managing loneliness in the workplace, and potential interventions to reduce it. Finally, we provide tangible guidance for organizations and practitioners on how to address and mitigate employee loneliness. Ultimately, our review underscores the complex nature of loneliness and work and establishes a foundation for advancing both scholarly discourse and organizational practices in this critical domain.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online education is a vital consumer industry that is undergoing rapid technological change. This paper develops a deep learning model to predict instructor performance on online education platforms from a content-based perspective. Specifically, we design an interpretable hierarchical transformer with contextual attention to predict instructor rating and course rating using textual data. Our model captures the inherent hierarchical structure of online courses and the sequential dependency of lectures within a course. Moreover, it goes beyond prediction and enables interpretability analysis, which provides additional insights into potential reasons behind the predictions made by the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms classic machine learning models as well as state-of-the-art deep learning models. Furthermore, we conduct in-depth interpretability analysis to explore what factors might predict the success of an online course at the lecture, sentence, and word level. We also showcase the value and applicability of our model through a randomized experiment. Our findings and methods provide managerial implications for instructors and online education platforms to improve course creation and delivery in this vitally important emerging market.</content>

One reason shoppers abandon their carts is because they don’t feel their decision to buy is final. Our study focuses on interface interventions that can help make decisions feel final. By drawing upon theories about why people feel uneasy with their choices, we examine how these interface interventions can ease negative feelings and help people commit to their decisions and complete their purchase. We conducted a series of controlled experiments to test interface interventions that provide users with direct support (i.e., coupons) and social support (i.e., social endorsements) for their choices. Our findings show that these interventions help reduce negative feelings and make decisions feel more final (i.e., a sense of choice closure), ultimately leading to greater customer satisfaction with their decisions.</content>

    <title>What Does Not Kill You Makes You Search: The Effects of Failure Threat and Self-Evaluation on Entrepreneurs’ Ego Networks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social network theory suggests that social networks, particularly diverse ones, are crucial for entrepreneurial resource acquisition and success. However, previous research has found that entrepreneurs do not necessarily develop diverse networks but tend to associate with similar others and develop closed networks. Building on problemistic search theory and perceptual control theory, we propose that as developing diverse networks consumes cognitive and time resources, entrepreneurs are more likely to do so when they face failure threats and do not evaluate themselves as able to address the threats. An experiment with 155 entrepreneurs in China found that failure threat increases entrepreneurs’ network diversity and that this effect is attenuated by self-affirmation. A longitudinal survey of 153 entrepreneurs in China showed that entrepreneurs whose self-worth is contingent upon business success develop social networks rich in structural holes in the short term and dense networks in the long term, and these effects are attenuated by entrepreneurial self-efficacy. These findings highlight the motivational and cognitive factors driving entrepreneurs’ social networks and contribute to social network theory, problemistic search theory, and perceptual control theory.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates whether male and female entrepreneurs exhibit systematic differences in the customer learning actions they pursue, and how those actions convert to venture performance. Drawing from a dyadic sample of founders and startup advisors in the high-technology context, we explore the effects of two alternative customer learning actions—customer involvement as an information source (CIS) and customer involvement as co-developers (CIC). We find that, compared to male entrepreneurs, female entrepreneurs engage in higher levels of both types of customer learning actions (CIS and CIC). Contrary to research from the large established firm context, we find CIS and CIC have conflicting startup performance implications—CIS is beneficial, but CIC is detrimental.</content>

    <title>How the Interplay Between Algorithmic &lt;scp&gt;HRM&lt;/scp&gt; Systems Promotes Gig Workers' Self‐Efficacy: The Role of Technostressors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The increasingly crucial algorithmic Human Resource Management (HRM) field is spawning two research streams: Algorithmic monitoring and algorithmic control. Yet, the conceptual differences and interplay between them have been largely confused and ignored in research and practice. This study clarifies their conceptual differences by exploring their interplay effect on gig workers' technostressors. Based on the stress and coping theory, a partial least squares structural equation modeling analysis by running data from 407 gig workers participating in a three‐wave time‐lagged survey was conducted. Results show that observational or interactional algorithmic monitoring hinders or promotes gig workers' self‐efficacy via both challenge and threat technostressors, respectively. While enhancing the positive effect of interactional algorithmic monitoring on self‐efficacy via threat technostressors, guiding algorithmic control attenuates the negative effect of observational algorithmic monitoring on self‐efficacy via challenge and threat technostressors, which contrasts with prior algorithmic HRM literature considering algorithmic control as a universally “bad thing” by workers. These findings deepen the understanding of the algorithmic HRM realm by revealing the differences and interplay between algorithmic monitoring and algorithmic control. Operators should differentiate and synergize control and monitoring functions by emphasizing outcomes that the interplay between algorithmic HRM systems has on the workforce.</content>

    <title>Do political connections stifle firm innovation? Natural experimental evidence from China's anti‐corruption campaigns</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The impact of political connections on firm innovation remains unclear. Utilizing the unexpected removal of high‐ranking officials during China's anti‐corruption campaigns between 1999 and 2015 as an exogenous shock, we analyze this relationship to provide greater clarity. Employing a difference‐in‐differences approach, we find that firms that experience unexpected loss of political connections file significantly more patent applications than those that do not experience such disruption. Further analyses indicate that this innovation boost is more pronounced for firms operating in highly competitive markets and those with substantial knowledge stocks. Our research therefore contributes novel empirical evidence to the discourse on political connections and firm innovation, highlighting the inhibitory effect of political connections and offering insights into the political economy of innovation.Managerial SummaryThis study explores the impact of anti‐corruption campaigns on the innovation efforts of firms with political connections in China. We discover that when such firms experience the unexpected loss of their political connections, they tend to file more patent applications, although this does not necessarily result in more patents being granted. It is important for firms and policymakers to understand that the response to such losses is not uniform. Firms are more likely to enhance their innovation efforts through increased patent applications if they are facing intense market competition or possess a rich knowledge stock. These findings underscore the importance of fostering a competitive market environment alongside anti‐corruption campaigns to stimulate innovation. Our study therefore sheds light on how to precisely assess the impact of anti‐corruption campaigns on firm behaviors and strategies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;National culture plays a vital role in shaping operations management (OM) practices, yet its impact remains largely underexplored. This paper builds on the Gupta and Gupta’s cross-cultural OM research framework that consists of three categories: operational decisions, supply chain management, and interdisciplinary topics. It highlights how national culture influences key areas such as product return policies, dynamic operations complexity, and buyer–supplier conflict management in cross-cultural relationships. Additionally, it examines national culture's role in determining post-acquisition performance in cross-border mergers and acquisitions, the adoption of digital piracy prevention strategies, and the relationship between language and operational performance in supply chains. To address emerging challenges, the paper extends the framework by introducing new research themes. It concludes with recommendations for future research, offering valuable guidance for scholars and practitioners navigating the complexities of managing culturally diverse and globally interconnected operations.</content>

    <title>Only a “Longish” Tail</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior to the Internet, many industries catering to mass audiences, particularly entertainment industries, tended to have very skewed sales distributions with most sales volume accruing to a small share of products (titles) generally known by terms such as “blockbusters.” The long tail hypothesis claims that increased Internet usage will weaken the dominance of blockbusters in these industries, so that the large number of obscure products, in aggregate, will become an important, perhaps primary, portion of the market. Such a change would have significant implications for firms’ operations. We test this hypothesis for the book industry with two analyses. First, using unusually rich data on book sales, we examine the temporal share of sales taken by niche titles as Internet retailing grew from obscurity to ubiquity. Changes in the distribution of sales by title popularity are weakly consistent with the direction of the hypothesis but not with the magnitude. Second, we exploit the 2011 bankruptcy of the Borders bookstore chain, and the resulting sudden shutdown of all its physical stores as a natural experiment. This analysis also finds a shift in sales away from the most successful titles. But the major beneficiaries are not the most obscure titles but instead titles that would regularly be found in most bookstores. Both analyses support a version of the long tail where the share of obscure titles changes from one very small value to a somewhat greater but still very small value. These results are inconsistent with proposed radical changes in management practices to accommodate a presumed large increase in product variety.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Beyond Opt-Out: How Presumed-Consent Language Shapes Persuasion</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When using opt-out (vs. opt-in) policies, choice architects presume that people consent, rather than explicitly asking them to state their consent. While opt-out policies often increase compliance, they are also associated with managerial issues such as ethical considerations, legal regulations, limited public support, and increased no-show rates. This research demonstrates that choice architects can also establish presumed-consent through the language they use, holding the opt-in policy constant. Seven studies in various health domains indicate that presumed-consent language (e.g., “a vaccine was arranged for you”) rather than explicit-consent language (e.g., “you can choose to get a vaccine”) increases persuasion (i.e., behavioral intentions, actual behaviors). This effect occurs through perceived endorsement: Decision makers infer through the presumed-consent language that the desired health behavior (e.g., vaccination) is the recommended course of action. Furthermore, this research examines the proposed endorsement process under various conditions. When product tangibility is low (e.g., a flu shot), the effectiveness of presumed-consent language stems primarily from perceived endorsement rather than psychological ownership or perceived ease. In contrast, when product tangibility is high (e.g., a sunscreen lotion), the effect stems primarily from psychological ownership rather than perceived endorsement or perceived ease.</content>

    <title>Holding back the damage: strong political institutions and the effect of populism on business investment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Populism is a political phenomenon that attempts to harness existing institutions for populist ends, often leading to negative consequences for businesses. However, can national institutions resist this pressure and mitigate the damage to firms? This paper investigates how populist electoral success influences corporate investment, unraveling the intricate connection between a country’s political institutions and the investment behavior of companies. Through the lens of political uncertainty and transaction cost economics, we theorize that countries with fortified checks and balances—facilitated by electoral systems (situated at the entrance to power), judicial independence (supervising the exercise of power), and government accountability (serving as ex-post checks)—effectively mitigate populist impulses. However, these checks and balances are also often targeted by populist leaders, as they prevent full implementation of a populist agenda. Analyzing a dataset spanning over 36,000 firms across 42 countries from 1995 to 2021, we find that existing checks and balances shield firms from populist excesses. In line with our theory, the longer a ruler is in power, the weaker these checks and balances remain. Our study highlights populism’s harm to business and the role of robust political institutions as mitigating factors.</content>

    <title>From Apathy to Allyship: Does Discrimination Awareness Received From Cross‐Race Friends Facilitate Racial Allyship at Work?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leveraging theories from the friendship, contact, and collective action literatures we examine the effects of a unique learning function of cross‐race friendships—discrimination awareness—on workplace allyship. Using field and experimental designs, we found that this function of cross‐race friendships creates a sense of moral outrage that motivates Whites to engage in and support allyship at work. This function predicted allyship behaviors and was resilient to ally risk, which reflects organizational sanctions for voicing concerns about racism. Robustness tests showed that other forms of interracial contact (positive/negative contact; residential, family, and work group diversity) had little effect on allyship and the effects of this friendship function held when we controlled for them. This function also contributed explanatory power beyond individual differences in race‐related ideologies and personality traits, such as social dominance orientation and beliefs in the malleability of prejudice. The relationship lens offered here brings new theoretical traction to the field of allyship and illustrates the potential of cross‐race friendships as sources of learning and agents for organizational change.</content>

    <title>Not in my homeland: Immigrant &lt;scp&gt;CEOs&lt;/scp&gt; and the geography of corporate social irresponsibility</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how immigrant CEOs influence the geography of multinational enterprises' (MNEs) corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) incidents. Building on place attachment theory and social capital theory, we theorize that immigrant CEOs have strong psychological attachment to and social capital in their homeland countries, which could reduce the occurrence and media disclosure of their MNEs' CSI incidents in those countries. Moreover, this effect will be further enhanced if the CEO emigrates as an adult, if the focal firm has a higher sustainability rating, and if the CEO's homeland country has lower press freedom. A difference‐in‐differences analysis using a propensity score‐matched sample of MNEs from the US S&amp;P 500 during the 2007–2020 period supports our arguments.Managerial SummaryWhy do firms engage in different levels of corporate irresponsibility in different locations? Our study reveals a connection between the appointment of an immigrant CEO and the locations of multinational enterprises (MNEs') irresponsible incidents. Immigrant CEOs can not only reduce their MNEs' harmful acts in their homelands because of their strong psychological attachment but also leverage social relationships in their homelands to mitigate media coverage of their firms' negative incidents there. Such impacts of appointing immigrant CEOs are subject to CEOs' immigration as adults or children, their firms' sustainability ratings, and their homeland countries' press freedom.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The choice between historical cost and fair value measurement is one of the most debated issues among accounting academics and practitioners. We use the election of the fair value option (FVO) to study the effects of entities’ measurement choices on accounting comparability. The FVO enables entities to use different measurement bases for similar assets and liabilities, raising questions about whether the FVO compromises or enhances comparability. Using a sample of US banks, we find that FVO elections increase comparability both across FVO electing banks and between FVO electing banks and banks that never elect the FVO but only if the FVO elections comply with the intent of the standard setters to remedy accounting mismatches. Overall our results suggest that banks elect the FVO to better present their economics, yielding higher comparability.</content>

    <title>The opportunity for partner industry knowledge sharing within audit offices and audit quality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conjecture that a greater opportunity for audit partners to share personal industry knowledge with each other within audit offices is associated with higher audit quality. Using Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Form AP data, we analyze each partner’s client portfolio and construct sharing measures. First, we find extant measures of an audit office’s industry market share, industry portfolio share, and industry diversity are quite noisy in inferring our sharing measures. Next, we perform multivariate analyses and find negative associations between the opportunity to share industry knowledge and both restatements and absolute abnormal accruals. Further, we find this association varies cross-sectionally with other important auditor and client characteristics. Taken together, our evidence is consistent with a positive association between the opportunity for partners to share their industry knowledge with each other and audit quality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use a long time-series from Australia to shed light on economic factors that led to audit market concentration and the Big N. We show that increases in the size of a small number of public companies was an important factor that led to large audit firms and market concentration. We also show that emerging Big N firms made sunk cost investments, including in the ability to provide industry expertise and non-audit services, which allowed them to retain clients, differentiate, and grow. These changes occurred around the time the profession lifted restrictions on advertising, which helped facilitate differentiation, and that larger, more complex clients switched to emerging Big N firms while smaller clients switched to non-Big N firms. We do not find that increases in audit market concentration reduced competition; our results instead suggest the audit market became more competitive over time.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Response Time Minimization for Cardiac Arrests</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cardiac arrests are a significant health concern in the United States, as more than 350,000 occur annually and 90% of them are fatal. Providing quick access to automated external defibrillators is paramount since irreversible damage to vital organs occurs within minutes without cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation. We propose a novel optimization model to design a network of drones delivering automated external defibrillators in response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. The network is modeled as a collection of queues in which the occurrence of cardiac arrests is modelled as a Poisson process while the drone service times and the arrival of cardiac arrest requests at drone bases are random variables whose distribution parameters are determined endogenously. The model is formulated as a fractional integer problem with bilinear terms and minimizes the average response time which is conducive to maximizing the chance of survival of patients. We derive a mixed-integer linear reformulation and develop an exact solution method that includes a warm-start approach and new optimality-based bound tightening models. We use real-life cardiac arrest data (i) to derive health care insights about the impact of delivery mode and drone technology on response time and probability of survival, (ii) to showcase the dependency of the service rate and response time on the utilization of drones and the need to endogenize the response time, and (iii) to ascertain the computational efficiency and scalability of our approach. The cross-validation analysis confirms the robustness of the model and its applicability to unseen OHCA data.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Maximizing Profit and Minimizing Waste with Buy-x-Get-y-Free Promotion Policies for Clearance Sales</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Maximizing profit and minimizing waste (leftover inventory) can be two conflicting objectives during clearance sales. BxG y policies (buy x units at full price and get y units free) are popular promotion policies for achieving these objectives. We consider four scenarios depending on whether customers are homogeneous/heterogeneous in their valuations and whether the retailer’s objective is to maximize profit/minimize waste. In each scenario, we characterize the structure of the optimal promotion policy (OPP). We categorize the two kinds of OPPs based on the retailer’s objective as profit-based and clearance-based OPPs. If customers are homogeneous, we show that B1G y policies are always optimal. However, if they are heterogeneous, B1Gy policies may not maximize profit, resulting in a complex structure for profit-based OPPs. Therefore, we focus on B1G0, B1G1, and B2G1 policies due to their prevalence among retailers. We then derive how both kinds of OPPs change with quantity. We explain the impact of quantity using the ideas of bundling effect and differentiation effect. We perform a numerical study to examine (i) the impact of the two kinds of OPPs on profit and waste, and (ii) the impact of demand uncertainty. Finally, we discuss how our results apply to several practical instances.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Failing to follow expert advice can have real and dangerous consequences. While any number of factors may lead a decision maker to refuse expert advice, the proliferation of algorithmic experts has further complicated the issue. One potential mechanism that restricts the acceptance of expert advice is betrayal aversion, or the strong dislike for the violation of trust norms. This study explores whether the introduction of expert algorithms in place of human experts can attenuate betrayal aversion and lead to higher overall rates of seeking expert advice. In other words, we ask: are decision makers averse to algorithmic betrayal? The answer to this question is uncertain ex ante. We answer this question through an experimental financial market where there is an identical risk of betrayal from either a human or algorithmic financial advisor. We find that the willingness to delegate to human experts is significantly reduced by betrayal aversion, while no betrayal aversion is exhibited toward algorithmic experts. The impact of betrayal aversion toward financial advisors is considerable: the resulting unwillingness to take the advice of the human expert leads to a 20% decrease in subsequent earnings, while no loss in earnings is observed in the algorithmic expert condition. This study has significant implications for firms, policymakers, and consumers, specifically in the financial services industry.This paper has been This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <title>EXPRESS: Overestimating Stars, Underestimating Numbers: The Hidden Impact of Rating Formats</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Some retailers use stars, while others use Arabic numerals to present product ratings. Do consumers evaluate product ratings differently depending on the format? Which format more accurately represents the true magnitude of ratings? Across 12 experiments, we find that neither format is veridical. Consumers overestimate fractional star ratings (e.g., [Formula: see text]) and underestimate fractional Arabic numerals (e.g., 3.5). The overestimation of graphical ratings arises from the visual-completion effect: when the visual system perceives an incomplete image of a star, it instinctively activates the complete image, causing consumers to anchor their magnitude judgments on rounded-up numbers (i.e., evaluation of [Formula: see text] is anchored on [Formula: see text]). Importantly, our results show that this overestimation of star ratings can be mitigated by using visually complete stars (e.g., [Formula: see text]). Conversely, the underestimation of Arabic numeral ratings stems from the left-digit effect, which leads consumers to anchor magnitude judgments on rounded-down numbers (i.e., evaluation of 3.5 is anchored on digit 3). Thus, both star and Arabic numeral ratings are systematically misestimated by consumers, with the extent of misestimation varying based on the fractional value and the star-filling technique employed. These findings demonstrate that prevalent rating formats are misleading, highlighting the need for new industry standards.</content>

    <title>Understanding Unitized Food Choice:  The Role of Social Context and Marketing Factors in Mitigating Overconsumption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The unit bias, which asserts that consumption decreases as a food unit size decreases, is a prominent effect studied in psychology, health, and obesity research domains, yet little is known about when or why this effect occurs, or how marketing plays a role in the effect. To address this gap in the literature, this research extends the current understanding of the unit bias by proposing the social unitization effect, which posits that consumers’ selection of discrete unitized foods is dependent on impression management motives. That is, when impression management motives are low, consumers choose a greater number of small (vs. large) food units; however, in social (public) settings, when impression management motives are higher, this difference between numbers of small and large food units selected is attenuated. This effect is driven by a reduction in the number of small units selected when consumers are with others (vs. when they are alone). The research then demonstrates how the social unitization effect manifests in various marketing contexts via marketing-related factors like servicescape design (e.g., in-store surveillance), food branding (e.g., branding food as “mini”), and food design (i.e., the shape of food units). These findings offer novel and actionable implications for marketers, health advocates, and consumers.</content>

    <title>Frame Overlapping in Moral Markets: The Case of an ‘Open, Free, and Neutral’ Telecommunications Network</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study explores how social movement activists, engaged in constructing and expanding moral markets, sustain the integrity of their initial moral values, avoiding dilution or cooptation by conventional market practices. Through a qualitative case study of a telecommunications network, we show that activists can expand a moral market by a process of frame overlapping, which involves the mechanisms of frame amplification with plural moral values, frame bridging with a resonant economic frame and frame extension adapting cultural templates. This process stands in contrast to previously identified dynamics in moral markets literature, such as ‘mutual cooptation’ between movements and firms, de‐coupling and re‐coupling the initial values, and ‘frame divergence’. We also underline different contextual factors that shape frame overlapping. Finally, the article examines the nature of moral markets and proposes a dynamic view of what makes a moral market ‘moral’.</content>

    <title>How Memes Affect Constituents’ Social Approval and Intention to Support Firms</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Theorists have suggested that firms seek to maintain or increase their social approval—defined as constituents’ general affinity for a firm—due to the belief that such approval significantly influences support for the firm and other important firm outcomes. However, the mechanisms underlying changes in constituents’ social approval and the translation of such approval into intention to support the firm remain unclear. In addition, most social approval research has focused on traditional media, whereas constituents increasingly get their news about firms from social media. To address these omissions, we use rhetorical theory to theorize that two characteristics of social media content—emotionality and satire—persuade constituents to change their social approval evaluations of firms and that changes in social approval affect constituents’ intention to support firms. We test the framework using memes in three online surveys that allow us to isolate these effects while maintaining ecological validity. Our results indicate that positive negative emotionality in social media content increases and decreases an individual’s approval of a firm, respectively, and satire amplifies these effects. Changes in approval similarly affect intention to support the firm. We also find a spillover effect for positive content but an individuating effect for negative content. We contribute to social approval and social media research by showing the power of social media content to change constituents’ approval of firms. Our findings advance social approval and social media research in management as new forms of media content emerge and shift how individuals evaluate and subsequently support firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze minute‐by‐minute Bloomberg online status and study how the effort provision of executives in public corporations affects firm value. While executives spend most of their time doing other activities, patterns of Bloomberg usage allow us to characterize their work habits as measures of effort provision. We document a positive effect of effort on unexpected earnings and cumulative abnormal returns following earnings announcements, and a reduction in credit default swap spreads. This is robust to using exogenous weather patterns as an instrument. Long‐short, calendar‐time effort portfolios earn significant average daily returns. Finally, we revisit important agency issues from the literature.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article explores how new venture leaders foster positive CEO–board relationships, a critical yet underdeveloped topic in governance research. We examine the ongoing interactions between first‐time CEOs and their boards, focusing on the tension between boards' need for influence and transparency and CEOs' desire for autonomy and control. Introducing the concept of “relationship cycles,” we demonstrate how early interactions create virtuous or vibcious feedback loops that shape long‐term governance outcomes. We also propose “board synchronization skill” as a key construct, highlighting how CEOs successfully manage communication to align competing goals. Finally, we set forth a temporal contingency view of live communication that reveals how interaction effectiveness varies by stage, thereby impacting CEO–board dynamics. More broadly, this study offers a process‐oriented view of governance, expanding our understanding of CEO–board relationships in ventures.Managerial SummaryThis article examines how leaders of new ventures can build and sustain effective CEO‐board relationships—an essential yet often overlooked aspect of corporate governance. Drawing on the experiences of first‐time CEOs, we explore the dynamic tension between a board's need for influence and transparency and a CEO's desire for autonomy and control. We introduce the concept of "relationship cycles" to explain how initial interactions can establish positive or negative feedback loops that influence long‐term governance outcomes. We also identify "board synchronization skill" as a critical capability for CEOs, emphasizing the importance of managing communication to balance competing priorities. Additionally, a stage‐specific approach to live communication is proposed, illustrating how the effectiveness of interactions evolves over time and shapes CEO‐board dynamics. Overall, the study takes a process‐oriented perspective, offering new insights into how governance practices can drive better alignment and performance in entrepreneurial ventures.</content>

    <title>Disaster Relief, Inc.: When Is Corporate Philanthropy Good or Bad for Shareholders?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A long–standing question in finance is why companies donate to charity, often attributing it to either managerial agency problems or strategic behavior. Based on a global sample of donation announcements by firms providing relief to disaster–affected communities, we test the relative importance of these two motives and the conditions under which each dominates. We exploit disaster–specific factors in an event study setting around corporate donation announcement dates to show that, on average, relief donations decrease returns. However, the strategic benefits of donating around salient events can mitigate these negative effects. To account for firms’ donation decisions, we rely on exogenous variation in the availability of corporate charitable funds due to the timing of disasters relative to firms’ financial years. We show that donations provide new information to the market, and that negative returns are primarily driven by cash donations made via corporate foundations.</content>

    <title>Arbitration with Uninformed Consumers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the impact of the arbitrator selection process on consumer outcomes. Using data from consumer arbitration cases in the securities industry over the past two decades, where we observe detailed information on case characteristics, the randomly generated list of potential arbitrators presented to both parties, the selected arbitrator, and case outcomes, we establish several motivating facts. These facts suggest that firms hold an informational advantage over consumers in selecting arbitrators, resulting in industry-friendly arbitration outcomes. We then develop and calibrate a quantitative model of arbitrator selection in which firms hold an informational advantage in selecting arbitrators. Arbitrators, who are compensated only if chosen, compete with each other to be selected. The model allows us to decompose the firms’ advantage into two components: the advantage of choosing pro-industry arbitrators from a given pool and the equilibrium pro-industry tilt in the arbitration pool that arises because of arbitrator competition. Selecting arbitrators without the input of firms and consumers would increase consumer awards by $60,000 on average relative to the current system. Forty percent of this effect arises because the pool of arbitrators skews pro-industry due to competition. Even an informed consumer cannot avoid this pro-industry equilibrium effect. Counterfactuals suggest that redesigning the arbitrator selection mechanism for the benefit of consumers hinges on whether consumers are informed. Policies intended to benefit consumers, such as increasing arbitrator compensation or giving parties more choice, would benefit informed consumers but hurt the uninformed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What is the impact of the real minimum wage on wages and inequality? I develop a theory that nests “The Race Between Education and Technology.” The theory predicts that the impact of changes in minimum wages is initially small but grows over time. I present empirical evidence of these dynamic effects: the elasticity of real wages grows substantially over a three-year period. I additionally show that minimum wages help rationalize a considerable decline in real wages of low-education workers in the 1980s and play a role in shaping the evolution of the U.S. college premium.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper identifies which investments in school facilities help students and which and are valued by homeowners. Using novel data on school district bonds, test scores, and house prices across 29 U.S. states and a research design based on narrowly decided elections with staggered timing, we find that increased capital spending in schools significantly improves test scores and is efficient on average. However, the effects vary widely depending on the type of project and the characteristics of the school district. Investments in essential infrastructure, such as HVAC systems or pollutant removal, yield notable improvements in student performance, while expenditures on athletic facilities show no measurable academic benefit. Socio-economically disadvantaged districts gain disproportionately from capital investments, even after accounting for project type, yet these districts typically underinvest in such projects.</content>

    <title>Selling Data to Marketers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The supply and the demand for data analytics are growing rapidly. Recent years have seen a surge in the availability of massive consumer data and in the emergence of data sellers (e.g., brokers and intermediaries). Unlike standard products, the value of data analytics for marketers depends on how their business decisions can be enabled and improved. In this paper, we investigate how a monopoly seller can offer a menu of data-based service plans to screen heterogenous marketers that can decide whether to take an action (e.g., direct selling, targeting, lending) with uncertain value and privately known cost. We characterize how, and for which marketers, the provision of information may be distorted in the optimal design. We present conditions under which optimally supplied information can be socially excessive or insufficient. It is shown that selling data appends may yield double reversals in the optimal service plans, in comparison with those when the seller’s offerings serve as marketing lists (i.e., the action is infeasible under the marketers’ outside option). We articulate how these results are coherently driven by the same underlying mechanism regarding how the marginal value of information is endogenously derived from the improvement in the marketers’ decision making over their default action. We also examine how our results can be enriched in alternative settings on the production and the costs of information.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01350 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The advent of cryptocurrencies and digital assets holds the promise of improving financial systems by offering cheap, quick, and secure transfer of value. However, it also opens up new payment channels for cybercrimes. Assembling a diverse set of public on- and off-chain, proprietary, and hand-collected data, including attacker–victim negotiations and dark web conversations in Russian, we present an initial anatomy of crypto-enabled cybercrimes, highlighting relevant economic issues and proposing areas for future research. Among others, we find ransomware, as the most dominant organized crypto-enabled cybercrime, entails criminal gangs that operate like firms who adopt modern revenue models and carefully manage their reputations. We suggest that blanket restrictions on cryptocurrency usage may prove counterproductive. Instead, blockchain transparency enables effective forensics for tracking, monitoring, and shutting down dominant cybercriminal organizations, which potentially facilitates a more secure and reliable crypto ecosystem in the longer term.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the National University of Singapore (NUS), Ripple’s University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI), the Israel Science Foundation (ISF), and the Cornell FinTech Initiative.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03691 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To protect inframarginal rents, rivals react to competition shocks by increasing product differentiation or lowering costs by standardizing products and production processes. We test these two mutually exclusive reactions by exploiting changes in rivals’ idiosyncratic stock return comovement following significant tariff cuts. While increased product differentiation implies a reduction in return comovement, greater standardization implies the opposite (a comovement increase). Difference-in-differences (DID) tests indicate that tariff cuts cause a significant increase in return comovement—in particular among within-industry “followers.” Treatment effects on cash flows, product counts, similarity scores, and business segment counts further support cost-cutting strategies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the extent to which creditors shape the executive bonus plans of their financially distressed borrowers. Financial distress can exacerbate agency conflicts between creditors and borrowers as concerns with underinvestment become more acute due to managerial myopia and debt overhang. Consequently, we expect creditors to exert their influence to ensure that these managers’ incentive-compensation plans encourage longer-term investments and directly reward outcomes that benefit creditors without exposing managers to unnecessary risk. We argue that bonus plans are an especially important way to provide these incentives because their flexibility allows creditors to more precisely target specific investment objectives. We find that borrowers’ bonus plans tend to have longer horizons and more convex payouts following covenant violations, especially when bonus plans can be a particularly effective way to address distress-related agency conflicts. Our evidence suggests that creditors protect their interests by exercising their control rights to shape their borrowers’ incentive-compensation plans.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Design and Pricing of a Single BundleProduct bundling is a widely used selling strategy among multiproduct firms, yet designing and pricing bundles optimally remain a complex challenge. In “Partition and Prosper: Design and Pricing of a Single Bundle,” Sun, Li, and Teo show that the selection and pricing of a single bundle from a range of products under multivariate normal valuations is polynomial-time solvable, provided that the associated covariance matrix can be decomposed into a positive diagonal matrix minus a positive semidefinite matrix of (small) fixed rank. Interestingly, they also show that if the individual product prices are predetermined, the optimization problem becomes NP hard even if customer valuations are independent. The authors use a Bayesian optimization algorithm combined with a novel conic integer programming reformulation to solve the problem under general valuation distributions and demonstrate the superior numerical performance of the algorithm via extensive simulations.</content>

    <title>How Do Domestic and Foreign Firms Respond to a Reduction in Competition from the Public Sector? Evidence from Vaccine Markets in India</title>
    <updated>2025-02-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how domestic and foreign firms in the private sector respond to a reduction in competition from the public sector. Our analysis exploits the sudden suspension of production licenses of vaccine-manufacturing public sector units (PSUs) in January 2008 in India, home to more than 1.2 billion people at that time. Although the suspension presented a window of opportunity for private sector firms, the opportunity was laden with high uncertainty. Despite this uncertainty, we find that the suspension was associated with revenue gains driven by new product introductions and that these gains persist even after the supply suspension revocation in February 2010. Importantly, unlike domestic firms, foreign firms gain little. We explore potential mechanisms and find evidence consistent with one of them being the major reason for the differing impact: Domestic firms better navigate the challenges arising from political pluralism, an institutional feature characterized by a lack of political alignment between national and subnational governments. In the presence of political alignment, domestic firms do not have a comparative advantage over foreign firms. Our evidence thus highlights that even an uncertain and transitory window of opportunity arising from a controversial reduction in competition from the public sector can lead to a fundamental market restructuring in ways that can diverge from the intended policy objective. In particular, domestic firms’ ability to manage political pluralism is a core mechanism explaining their comparative advantage over foreign firms in the wake of a national crisis.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by the National University of Singapore [Start-Up Research Grant A-0003843-00-00], the University of Minnesota [Summer Research Grant], and the Indian School of Business [Research Grant].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06174 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Is more competition the key to mitigating dominance by large tech platforms? Could regulation of such markets be a better alternative? We study the effects of competition and interoperability regulation in platform markets. To do so, we propose an approach of competition in net fees, which is well-suited to situations in which users pay additional charges, after joining, for on-platform interactions. Compared with existing approaches, the net fee model expands the tractable scope to allow variable total demand, platform asymmetry, and merger analysis. Regarding competition, we find that adding more platforms to the market may lead to the emergence of a dominant firm. In contrast, we find that interoperability can play a key role in reducing market dominance and lowering prices. Broadly speaking, our results favor policy interventions that assure the formidability of the competition that dominant platforms face.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: L.

    <title>Economics of Social Media Fake Accounts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Amid the rise of the influencer economy, fake social media accounts have become prevalent on many social media platforms. Yet the problem of fake accounts is still poorly understood, and so is the effectiveness of coping strategies. This research models the ecosystem of fake accounts in an influencer economy and obtains insights on fake account purchasing behaviors, the impact of antifake efforts, and the roles of various contextual factors. We show that as the antifake effort increases, the equilibrium may transition from a “pooling” equilibrium, where a low-quality influencer buys fake accounts to mimic a high-quality one, to a “costly separating” equilibrium, where a high-quality influencer may buy fake accounts to prevent mimicry from a low-quality influencer, and to a “naturally separating” equilibrium where low- and high-quality influencers are separated without buying fake accounts. We find that increasing antifake efforts and increasing social media literacy may sometimes result in more fake accounts. A purely profit-driven platform always prefers a pooling equilibrium with zero antifake effort. As a platform puts more weight on consumer welfare, it may exert a positive effort to induce a separating equilibrium, but the platform’s preferred antifake effort tends to be lower than that of consumers. We also find that the platform sometimes prefers a lower social media literacy and a lower fake account base price, whereas consumers prefer the opposite. In contrast, improving the antifake technology level can benefit both the platform and consumers. Our main insights are applicable to scenarios with more influencer types and repeated interactions.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Much psychologically oriented micro‐CSR research emphasizesintra‐individual processes, leading to a relative omission of the role of interactions among individuals in managing CSR. This limitation hinders the potential of such micro‐CSR research to explain CSR as an organizational‐level outcome. We adopt a meta‐synthesis methodology to extract insights oninter‐individual processes in CSR management from existing literature that examines CSR's microfoundations beyond a purely psychological perspective. By incorporating a causal mechanism approach into our meta‐synthesis, we develop a theoretical framework comprising three causal mechanisms that elucidate how individual behaviours and interactions of differing sets of dominant actor types (including change agents, supporters, opportunists, resisters and top and senior management) foster substantive or incremental progress in CSR or its obstruction within firms. Our findings establish a foundation for further research into individual‐level and temporal dynamics in CSR management, and the conditions under which firms are more likely to implement impactful CSR initiatives.</content>
