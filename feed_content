    <title>How the Interplay Between Algorithmic &lt;scp&gt;HRM&lt;/scp&gt; Systems Promotes Gig Workers' Self‐Efficacy: The Role of Technostressors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The increasingly crucial algorithmic Human Resource Management (HRM) field is spawning two research streams: Algorithmic monitoring and algorithmic control. Yet, the conceptual differences and interplay between them have been largely confused and ignored in research and practice. This study clarifies their conceptual differences by exploring their interplay effect on gig workers' technostressors. Based on the stress and coping theory, a partial least squares structural equation modeling analysis by running data from 407 gig workers participating in a three‐wave time‐lagged survey was conducted. Results show that observational or interactional algorithmic monitoring hinders or promotes gig workers' self‐efficacy via both challenge and threat technostressors, respectively. While enhancing the positive effect of interactional algorithmic monitoring on self‐efficacy via threat technostressors, guiding algorithmic control attenuates the negative effect of observational algorithmic monitoring on self‐efficacy via challenge and threat technostressors, which contrasts with prior algorithmic HRM literature considering algorithmic control as a universally “bad thing” by workers. These findings deepen the understanding of the algorithmic HRM realm by revealing the differences and interplay between algorithmic monitoring and algorithmic control. Operators should differentiate and synergize control and monitoring functions by emphasizing outcomes that the interplay between algorithmic HRM systems has on the workforce.</content>

    <title>Do political connections stifle firm innovation? Natural experimental evidence from China's anti‐corruption campaigns</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The impact of political connections on firm innovation remains unclear. Utilizing the unexpected removal of high‐ranking officials during China's anti‐corruption campaigns between 1999 and 2015 as an exogenous shock, we analyze this relationship to provide greater clarity. Employing a difference‐in‐differences approach, we find that firms that experience unexpected loss of political connections file significantly more patent applications than those that do not experience such disruption. Further analyses indicate that this innovation boost is more pronounced for firms operating in highly competitive markets and those with substantial knowledge stocks. Our research therefore contributes novel empirical evidence to the discourse on political connections and firm innovation, highlighting the inhibitory effect of political connections and offering insights into the political economy of innovation.Managerial SummaryThis study explores the impact of anti‐corruption campaigns on the innovation efforts of firms with political connections in China. We discover that when such firms experience the unexpected loss of their political connections, they tend to file more patent applications, although this does not necessarily result in more patents being granted. It is important for firms and policymakers to understand that the response to such losses is not uniform. Firms are more likely to enhance their innovation efforts through increased patent applications if they are facing intense market competition or possess a rich knowledge stock. These findings underscore the importance of fostering a competitive market environment alongside anti‐corruption campaigns to stimulate innovation. Our study therefore sheds light on how to precisely assess the impact of anti‐corruption campaigns on firm behaviors and strategies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;National culture plays a vital role in shaping operations management (OM) practices, yet its impact remains largely underexplored. This paper builds on the Gupta and Gupta’s cross-cultural OM research framework that consists of three categories: operational decisions, supply chain management, and interdisciplinary topics. It highlights how national culture influences key areas such as product return policies, dynamic operations complexity, and buyer–supplier conflict management in cross-cultural relationships. Additionally, it examines national culture's role in determining post-acquisition performance in cross-border mergers and acquisitions, the adoption of digital piracy prevention strategies, and the relationship between language and operational performance in supply chains. To address emerging challenges, the paper extends the framework by introducing new research themes. It concludes with recommendations for future research, offering valuable guidance for scholars and practitioners navigating the complexities of managing culturally diverse and globally interconnected operations.</content>

    <title>Only a “Longish” Tail</title>
    <updated>2025-02-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior to the Internet, many industries catering to mass audiences, particularly entertainment industries, tended to have very skewed sales distributions with most sales volume accruing to a small share of products (titles) generally known by terms such as “blockbusters.” The long tail hypothesis claims that increased Internet usage will weaken the dominance of blockbusters in these industries, so that the large number of obscure products, in aggregate, will become an important, perhaps primary, portion of the market. Such a change would have significant implications for firms’ operations. We test this hypothesis for the book industry with two analyses. First, using unusually rich data on book sales, we examine the temporal share of sales taken by niche titles as Internet retailing grew from obscurity to ubiquity. Changes in the distribution of sales by title popularity are weakly consistent with the direction of the hypothesis but not with the magnitude. Second, we exploit the 2011 bankruptcy of the Borders bookstore chain, and the resulting sudden shutdown of all its physical stores as a natural experiment. This analysis also finds a shift in sales away from the most successful titles. But the major beneficiaries are not the most obscure titles but instead titles that would regularly be found in most bookstores. Both analyses support a version of the long tail where the share of obscure titles changes from one very small value to a somewhat greater but still very small value. These results are inconsistent with proposed radical changes in management practices to accommodate a presumed large increase in product variety.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Beyond Opt-Out: How Presumed-Consent Language Shapes Persuasion</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When using opt-out (vs. opt-in) policies, choice architects presume that people consent, rather than explicitly asking them to state their consent. While opt-out policies often increase compliance, they are also associated with managerial issues such as ethical considerations, legal regulations, limited public support, and increased no-show rates. This research demonstrates that choice architects can also establish presumed-consent through the language they use, holding the opt-in policy constant. Seven studies in various health domains indicate that presumed-consent language (e.g., “a vaccine was arranged for you”) rather than explicit-consent language (e.g., “you can choose to get a vaccine”) increases persuasion (i.e., behavioral intentions, actual behaviors). This effect occurs through perceived endorsement: Decision makers infer through the presumed-consent language that the desired health behavior (e.g., vaccination) is the recommended course of action. Furthermore, this research examines the proposed endorsement process under various conditions. When product tangibility is low (e.g., a flu shot), the effectiveness of presumed-consent language stems primarily from perceived endorsement rather than psychological ownership or perceived ease. In contrast, when product tangibility is high (e.g., a sunscreen lotion), the effect stems primarily from psychological ownership rather than perceived endorsement or perceived ease.</content>

    <title>Holding back the damage: strong political institutions and the effect of populism on business investment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Populism is a political phenomenon that attempts to harness existing institutions for populist ends, often leading to negative consequences for businesses. However, can national institutions resist this pressure and mitigate the damage to firms? This paper investigates how populist electoral success influences corporate investment, unraveling the intricate connection between a country’s political institutions and the investment behavior of companies. Through the lens of political uncertainty and transaction cost economics, we theorize that countries with fortified checks and balances—facilitated by electoral systems (situated at the entrance to power), judicial independence (supervising the exercise of power), and government accountability (serving as ex-post checks)—effectively mitigate populist impulses. However, these checks and balances are also often targeted by populist leaders, as they prevent full implementation of a populist agenda. Analyzing a dataset spanning over 36,000 firms across 42 countries from 1995 to 2021, we find that existing checks and balances shield firms from populist excesses. In line with our theory, the longer a ruler is in power, the weaker these checks and balances remain. Our study highlights populism’s harm to business and the role of robust political institutions as mitigating factors.</content>

    <title>From Apathy to Allyship: Does Discrimination Awareness Received From Cross‐Race Friends Facilitate Racial Allyship at Work?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leveraging theories from the friendship, contact, and collective action literatures we examine the effects of a unique learning function of cross‐race friendships—discrimination awareness—on workplace allyship. Using field and experimental designs, we found that this function of cross‐race friendships creates a sense of moral outrage that motivates Whites to engage in and support allyship at work. This function predicted allyship behaviors and was resilient to ally risk, which reflects organizational sanctions for voicing concerns about racism. Robustness tests showed that other forms of interracial contact (positive/negative contact; residential, family, and work group diversity) had little effect on allyship and the effects of this friendship function held when we controlled for them. This function also contributed explanatory power beyond individual differences in race‐related ideologies and personality traits, such as social dominance orientation and beliefs in the malleability of prejudice. The relationship lens offered here brings new theoretical traction to the field of allyship and illustrates the potential of cross‐race friendships as sources of learning and agents for organizational change.</content>

    <title>Not in my homeland: Immigrant &lt;scp&gt;CEOs&lt;/scp&gt; and the geography of corporate social irresponsibility</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how immigrant CEOs influence the geography of multinational enterprises' (MNEs) corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) incidents. Building on place attachment theory and social capital theory, we theorize that immigrant CEOs have strong psychological attachment to and social capital in their homeland countries, which could reduce the occurrence and media disclosure of their MNEs' CSI incidents in those countries. Moreover, this effect will be further enhanced if the CEO emigrates as an adult, if the focal firm has a higher sustainability rating, and if the CEO's homeland country has lower press freedom. A difference‐in‐differences analysis using a propensity score‐matched sample of MNEs from the US S&amp;P 500 during the 2007–2020 period supports our arguments.Managerial SummaryWhy do firms engage in different levels of corporate irresponsibility in different locations? Our study reveals a connection between the appointment of an immigrant CEO and the locations of multinational enterprises (MNEs') irresponsible incidents. Immigrant CEOs can not only reduce their MNEs' harmful acts in their homelands because of their strong psychological attachment but also leverage social relationships in their homelands to mitigate media coverage of their firms' negative incidents there. Such impacts of appointing immigrant CEOs are subject to CEOs' immigration as adults or children, their firms' sustainability ratings, and their homeland countries' press freedom.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The choice between historical cost and fair value measurement is one of the most debated issues among accounting academics and practitioners. We use the election of the fair value option (FVO) to study the effects of entities’ measurement choices on accounting comparability. The FVO enables entities to use different measurement bases for similar assets and liabilities, raising questions about whether the FVO compromises or enhances comparability. Using a sample of US banks, we find that FVO elections increase comparability both across FVO electing banks and between FVO electing banks and banks that never elect the FVO but only if the FVO elections comply with the intent of the standard setters to remedy accounting mismatches. Overall our results suggest that banks elect the FVO to better present their economics, yielding higher comparability.</content>

    <title>The opportunity for partner industry knowledge sharing within audit offices and audit quality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conjecture that a greater opportunity for audit partners to share personal industry knowledge with each other within audit offices is associated with higher audit quality. Using Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Form AP data, we analyze each partner’s client portfolio and construct sharing measures. First, we find extant measures of an audit office’s industry market share, industry portfolio share, and industry diversity are quite noisy in inferring our sharing measures. Next, we perform multivariate analyses and find negative associations between the opportunity to share industry knowledge and both restatements and absolute abnormal accruals. Further, we find this association varies cross-sectionally with other important auditor and client characteristics. Taken together, our evidence is consistent with a positive association between the opportunity for partners to share their industry knowledge with each other and audit quality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use a long time-series from Australia to shed light on economic factors that led to audit market concentration and the Big N. We show that increases in the size of a small number of public companies was an important factor that led to large audit firms and market concentration. We also show that emerging Big N firms made sunk cost investments, including in the ability to provide industry expertise and non-audit services, which allowed them to retain clients, differentiate, and grow. These changes occurred around the time the profession lifted restrictions on advertising, which helped facilitate differentiation, and that larger, more complex clients switched to emerging Big N firms while smaller clients switched to non-Big N firms. We do not find that increases in audit market concentration reduced competition; our results instead suggest the audit market became more competitive over time.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Response Time Minimization for Cardiac Arrests</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cardiac arrests are a significant health concern in the United States, as more than 350,000 occur annually and 90% of them are fatal. Providing quick access to automated external defibrillators is paramount since irreversible damage to vital organs occurs within minutes without cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation. We propose a novel optimization model to design a network of drones delivering automated external defibrillators in response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. The network is modeled as a collection of queues in which the occurrence of cardiac arrests is modelled as a Poisson process while the drone service times and the arrival of cardiac arrest requests at drone bases are random variables whose distribution parameters are determined endogenously. The model is formulated as a fractional integer problem with bilinear terms and minimizes the average response time which is conducive to maximizing the chance of survival of patients. We derive a mixed-integer linear reformulation and develop an exact solution method that includes a warm-start approach and new optimality-based bound tightening models. We use real-life cardiac arrest data (i) to derive health care insights about the impact of delivery mode and drone technology on response time and probability of survival, (ii) to showcase the dependency of the service rate and response time on the utilization of drones and the need to endogenize the response time, and (iii) to ascertain the computational efficiency and scalability of our approach. The cross-validation analysis confirms the robustness of the model and its applicability to unseen OHCA data.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Maximizing Profit and Minimizing Waste with Buy-x-Get-y-Free Promotion Policies for Clearance Sales</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Maximizing profit and minimizing waste (leftover inventory) can be two conflicting objectives during clearance sales. BxG y policies (buy x units at full price and get y units free) are popular promotion policies for achieving these objectives. We consider four scenarios depending on whether customers are homogeneous/heterogeneous in their valuations and whether the retailer’s objective is to maximize profit/minimize waste. In each scenario, we characterize the structure of the optimal promotion policy (OPP). We categorize the two kinds of OPPs based on the retailer’s objective as profit-based and clearance-based OPPs. If customers are homogeneous, we show that B1G y policies are always optimal. However, if they are heterogeneous, B1Gy policies may not maximize profit, resulting in a complex structure for profit-based OPPs. Therefore, we focus on B1G0, B1G1, and B2G1 policies due to their prevalence among retailers. We then derive how both kinds of OPPs change with quantity. We explain the impact of quantity using the ideas of bundling effect and differentiation effect. We perform a numerical study to examine (i) the impact of the two kinds of OPPs on profit and waste, and (ii) the impact of demand uncertainty. Finally, we discuss how our results apply to several practical instances.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Failing to follow expert advice can have real and dangerous consequences. While any number of factors may lead a decision maker to refuse expert advice, the proliferation of algorithmic experts has further complicated the issue. One potential mechanism that restricts the acceptance of expert advice is betrayal aversion, or the strong dislike for the violation of trust norms. This study explores whether the introduction of expert algorithms in place of human experts can attenuate betrayal aversion and lead to higher overall rates of seeking expert advice. In other words, we ask: are decision makers averse to algorithmic betrayal? The answer to this question is uncertain ex ante. We answer this question through an experimental financial market where there is an identical risk of betrayal from either a human or algorithmic financial advisor. We find that the willingness to delegate to human experts is significantly reduced by betrayal aversion, while no betrayal aversion is exhibited toward algorithmic experts. The impact of betrayal aversion toward financial advisors is considerable: the resulting unwillingness to take the advice of the human expert leads to a 20% decrease in subsequent earnings, while no loss in earnings is observed in the algorithmic expert condition. This study has significant implications for firms, policymakers, and consumers, specifically in the financial services industry.This paper has been This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <title>EXPRESS: Overestimating Stars, Underestimating Numbers: The Hidden Impact of Rating Formats</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Some retailers use stars, while others use Arabic numerals to present product ratings. Do consumers evaluate product ratings differently depending on the format? Which format more accurately represents the true magnitude of ratings? Across 12 experiments, we find that neither format is veridical. Consumers overestimate fractional star ratings (e.g., [Formula: see text]) and underestimate fractional Arabic numerals (e.g., 3.5). The overestimation of graphical ratings arises from the visual-completion effect: when the visual system perceives an incomplete image of a star, it instinctively activates the complete image, causing consumers to anchor their magnitude judgments on rounded-up numbers (i.e., evaluation of [Formula: see text] is anchored on [Formula: see text]). Importantly, our results show that this overestimation of star ratings can be mitigated by using visually complete stars (e.g., [Formula: see text]). Conversely, the underestimation of Arabic numeral ratings stems from the left-digit effect, which leads consumers to anchor magnitude judgments on rounded-down numbers (i.e., evaluation of 3.5 is anchored on digit 3). Thus, both star and Arabic numeral ratings are systematically misestimated by consumers, with the extent of misestimation varying based on the fractional value and the star-filling technique employed.

    <title>Understanding Unitized Food Choice:  The Role of Social Context and Marketing Factors in Mitigating Overconsumption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The unit bias, which asserts that consumption decreases as a food unit size decreases, is a prominent effect studied in psychology, health, and obesity research domains, yet little is known about when or why this effect occurs, or how marketing plays a role in the effect. To address this gap in the literature, this research extends the current understanding of the unit bias by proposing the social unitization effect, which posits that consumers’ selection of discrete unitized foods is dependent on impression management motives. That is, when impression management motives are low, consumers choose a greater number of small (vs. large) food units; however, in social (public) settings, when impression management motives are higher, this difference between numbers of small and large food units selected is attenuated. This effect is driven by a reduction in the number of small units selected when consumers are with others (vs. when they are alone). The research then demonstrates how the social unitization effect manifests in various marketing contexts via marketing-related factors like servicescape design (e.g., in-store surveillance), food branding (e.g., branding food as “mini”), and food design (i.e., the shape of food units). These findings offer novel and actionable implications for marketers, health advocates, and consumers.</content>

    <title>Frame Overlapping in Moral Markets: The Case of an ‘Open, Free, and Neutral’ Telecommunications Network</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study explores how social movement activists, engaged in constructing and expanding moral markets, sustain the integrity of their initial moral values, avoiding dilution or cooptation by conventional market practices. Through a qualitative case study of a telecommunications network, we show that activists can expand a moral market by a process of frame overlapping, which involves the mechanisms of frame amplification with plural moral values, frame bridging with a resonant economic frame and frame extension adapting cultural templates. This process stands in contrast to previously identified dynamics in moral markets literature, such as ‘mutual cooptation’ between movements and firms, de‐coupling and re‐coupling the initial values, and ‘frame divergence’. We also underline different contextual factors that shape frame overlapping. Finally, the article examines the nature of moral markets and proposes a dynamic view of what makes a moral market ‘moral’.</content>

    <title>How Memes Affect Constituents’ Social Approval and Intention to Support Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Theorists have suggested that firms seek to maintain or increase their social approval—defined as constituents’ general affinity for a firm—due to the belief that such approval significantly influences support for the firm and other important firm outcomes. However, the mechanisms underlying changes in constituents’ social approval and the translation of such approval into intention to support the firm remain unclear. In addition, most social approval research has focused on traditional media, whereas constituents increasingly get their news about firms from social media. To address these omissions, we use rhetorical theory to theorize that two characteristics of social media content—emotionality and satire—persuade constituents to change their social approval evaluations of firms and that changes in social approval affect constituents’ intention to support firms. We test the framework using memes in three online surveys that allow us to isolate these effects while maintaining ecological validity. Our results indicate that positive negative emotionality in social media content increases and decreases an individual’s approval of a firm, respectively, and satire amplifies these effects. Changes in approval similarly affect intention to support the firm. We also find a spillover effect for positive content but an individuating effect for negative content. We contribute to social approval and social media research by showing the power of social media content to change constituents’ approval of firms. Our findings advance social approval and social media research in management as new forms of media content emerge and shift how individuals evaluate and subsequently support firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze minute‐by‐minute Bloomberg online status and study how the effort provision of executives in public corporations affects firm value. While executives spend most of their time doing other activities, patterns of Bloomberg usage allow us to characterize their work habits as measures of effort provision. We document a positive effect of effort on unexpected earnings and cumulative abnormal returns following earnings announcements, and a reduction in credit default swap spreads. This is robust to using exogenous weather patterns as an instrument. Long‐short, calendar‐time effort portfolios earn significant average daily returns. Finally, we revisit important agency issues from the literature.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article explores how new venture leaders foster positive CEO–board relationships, a critical yet underdeveloped topic in governance research. We examine the ongoing interactions between first‐time CEOs and their boards, focusing on the tension between boards' need for influence and transparency and CEOs' desire for autonomy and control. Introducing the concept of “relationship cycles,” we demonstrate how early interactions create virtuous or vibcious feedback loops that shape long‐term governance outcomes. We also propose “board synchronization skill” as a key construct, highlighting how CEOs successfully manage communication to align competing goals. Finally, we set forth a temporal contingency view of live communication that reveals how interaction effectiveness varies by stage, thereby impacting CEO–board dynamics. More broadly, this study offers a process‐oriented view of governance, expanding our understanding of CEO–board relationships in ventures.Managerial SummaryThis article examines how leaders of new ventures can build and sustain effective CEO‐board relationships—an essential yet often overlooked aspect of corporate governance. Drawing on the experiences of first‐time CEOs, we explore the dynamic tension between a board's need for influence and transparency and a CEO's desire for autonomy and control. We introduce the concept of "relationship cycles" to explain how initial interactions can establish positive or negative feedback loops that influence long‐term governance outcomes. We also identify "board synchronization skill" as a critical capability for CEOs, emphasizing the importance of managing communication to balance competing priorities. Additionally, a stage‐specific approach to live communication is proposed, illustrating how the effectiveness of interactions evolves over time and shapes CEO‐board dynamics. Overall, the study takes a process‐oriented perspective, offering new insights into how governance practices can drive better alignment and performance in entrepreneurial ventures.</content>

    <title>Disaster Relief, Inc.: When Is Corporate Philanthropy Good or Bad for Shareholders?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A long–standing question in finance is why companies donate to charity, often attributing it to either managerial agency problems or strategic behavior. Based on a global sample of donation announcements by firms providing relief to disaster–affected communities, we test the relative importance of these two motives and the conditions under which each dominates. We exploit disaster–specific factors in an event study setting around corporate donation announcement dates to show that, on average, relief donations decrease returns. However, the strategic benefits of donating around salient events can mitigate these negative effects. To account for firms’ donation decisions, we rely on exogenous variation in the availability of corporate charitable funds due to the timing of disasters relative to firms’ financial years. We show that donations provide new information to the market, and that negative returns are primarily driven by cash donations made via corporate foundations.</content>

    <title>Arbitration with Uninformed Consumers</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the impact of the arbitrator selection process on consumer outcomes. Using data from consumer arbitration cases in the securities industry over the past two decades, where we observe detailed information on case characteristics, the randomly generated list of potential arbitrators presented to both parties, the selected arbitrator, and case outcomes, we establish several motivating facts. These facts suggest that firms hold an informational advantage over consumers in selecting arbitrators, resulting in industry-friendly arbitration outcomes. We then develop and calibrate a quantitative model of arbitrator selection in which firms hold an informational advantage in selecting arbitrators. Arbitrators, who are compensated only if chosen, compete with each other to be selected. The model allows us to decompose the firms’ advantage into two components: the advantage of choosing pro-industry arbitrators from a given pool and the equilibrium pro-industry tilt in the arbitration pool that arises because of arbitrator competition. Selecting arbitrators without the input of firms and consumers would increase consumer awards by $60,000 on average relative to the current system. Forty percent of this effect arises because the pool of arbitrators skews pro-industry due to competition. Even an informed consumer cannot avoid this pro-industry equilibrium effect. Counterfactuals suggest that redesigning the arbitrator selection mechanism for the benefit of consumers hinges on whether consumers are informed. Policies intended to benefit consumers, such as increasing arbitrator compensation or giving parties more choice, would benefit informed consumers but hurt the uninformed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What is the impact of the real minimum wage on wages and inequality? I develop a theory that nests “The Race Between Education and Technology.” The theory predicts that the impact of changes in minimum wages is initially small but grows over time. I present empirical evidence of these dynamic effects: the elasticity of real wages grows substantially over a three-year period. I additionally show that minimum wages help rationalize a considerable decline in real wages of low-education workers in the 1980s and play a role in shaping the evolution of the U.S. college premium.</content>

    <title>What Works and for Whom? Effectiveness and Efficiency of School Capital Investments Across the U.S.</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper identifies which investments in school facilities help students and which and are valued by homeowners. Using novel data on school district bonds, test scores, and house prices across 29 U.S. states and a research design based on narrowly decided elections with staggered timing, we find that increased capital spending in schools significantly improves test scores and is efficient on average. However, the effects vary widely depending on the type of project and the characteristics of the school district. Investments in essential infrastructure, such as HVAC systems or pollutant removal, yield notable improvements in student performance, while expenditures on athletic facilities show no measurable academic benefit. Socio-economically disadvantaged districts gain disproportionately from capital investments, even after accounting for project type, yet these districts typically underinvest in such projects.</content>

    <title>Selling Data to Marketers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The supply and the demand for data analytics are growing rapidly. Recent years have seen a surge in the availability of massive consumer data and in the emergence of data sellers (e.g., brokers and intermediaries). Unlike standard products, the value of data analytics for marketers depends on how their business decisions can be enabled and improved. In this paper, we investigate how a monopoly seller can offer a menu of data-based service plans to screen heterogenous marketers that can decide whether to take an action (e.g., direct selling, targeting, lending) with uncertain value and privately known cost. We characterize how, and for which marketers, the provision of information may be distorted in the optimal design. We present conditions under which optimally supplied information can be socially excessive or insufficient. It is shown that selling data appends may yield double reversals in the optimal service plans, in comparison with those when the seller’s offerings serve as marketing lists (i.e., the action is infeasible under the marketers’ outside option). We articulate how these results are coherently driven by the same underlying mechanism regarding how the marginal value of information is endogenously derived from the improvement in the marketers’ decision making over their default action. We also examine how our results can be enriched in alternative settings on the production and the costs of information.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The advent of cryptocurrencies and digital assets holds the promise of improving financial systems by offering cheap, quick, and secure transfer of value. However, it also opens up new payment channels for cybercrimes. Assembling a diverse set of public on- and off-chain, proprietary, and hand-collected data, including attacker–victim negotiations and dark web conversations in Russian, we present an initial anatomy of crypto-enabled cybercrimes, highlighting relevant economic issues and proposing areas for future research. Among others, we find ransomware, as the most dominant organized crypto-enabled cybercrime, entails criminal gangs that operate like firms who adopt modern revenue models and carefully manage their reputations. We suggest that blanket restrictions on cryptocurrency usage may prove counterproductive. Instead, blockchain transparency enables effective forensics for tracking, monitoring, and shutting down dominant cybercriminal organizations, which potentially facilitates a more secure and reliable crypto ecosystem in the longer term.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the National University of Singapore (NUS), Ripple’s University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI), the Israel Science Foundation (ISF), and the Cornell FinTech Initiative.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03691 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To protect inframarginal rents, rivals react to competition shocks by increasing product differentiation or lowering costs by standardizing products and production processes. We test these two mutually exclusive reactions by exploiting changes in rivals’ idiosyncratic stock return comovement following significant tariff cuts. While increased product differentiation implies a reduction in return comovement, greater standardization implies the opposite (a comovement increase). Difference-in-differences (DID) tests indicate that tariff cuts cause a significant increase in return comovement—in particular among within-industry “followers.” Treatment effects on cash flows, product counts, similarity scores, and business segment counts further support cost-cutting strategies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the extent to which creditors shape the executive bonus plans of their financially distressed borrowers. Financial distress can exacerbate agency conflicts between creditors and borrowers as concerns with underinvestment become more acute due to managerial myopia and debt overhang. Consequently, we expect creditors to exert their influence to ensure that these managers’ incentive-compensation plans encourage longer-term investments and directly reward outcomes that benefit creditors without exposing managers to unnecessary risk. We argue that bonus plans are an especially important way to provide these incentives because their flexibility allows creditors to more precisely target specific investment objectives. We find that borrowers’ bonus plans tend to have longer horizons and more convex payouts following covenant violations, especially when bonus plans can be a particularly effective way to address distress-related agency conflicts. Our evidence suggests that creditors protect their interests by exercising their control rights to shape their borrowers’ incentive-compensation plans.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Design and Pricing of a Single BundleProduct bundling is a widely used selling strategy among multiproduct firms, yet designing and pricing bundles optimally remain a complex challenge. In “Partition and Prosper: Design and Pricing of a Single Bundle,” Sun, Li, and Teo show that the selection and pricing of a single bundle from a range of products under multivariate normal valuations is polynomial-time solvable, provided that the associated covariance matrix can be decomposed into a positive diagonal matrix minus a positive semidefinite matrix of (small) fixed rank. Interestingly, they also show that if the individual product prices are predetermined, the optimization problem becomes NP hard even if customer valuations are independent. The authors use a Bayesian optimization algorithm combined with a novel conic integer programming reformulation to solve the problem under general valuation distributions and demonstrate the superior numerical performance of the algorithm via extensive simulations.</content>

    <title>How Do Domestic and Foreign Firms Respond to a Reduction in Competition from the Public Sector? Evidence from Vaccine Markets in India</title>
    <updated>2025-02-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how domestic and foreign firms in the private sector respond to a reduction in competition from the public sector. Our analysis exploits the sudden suspension of production licenses of vaccine-manufacturing public sector units (PSUs) in January 2008 in India, home to more than 1.2 billion people at that time. Although the suspension presented a window of opportunity for private sector firms, the opportunity was laden with high uncertainty. Despite this uncertainty, we find that the suspension was associated with revenue gains driven by new product introductions and that these gains persist even after the supply suspension revocation in February 2010. Importantly, unlike domestic firms, foreign firms gain little. We explore potential mechanisms and find evidence consistent with one of them being the major reason for the differing impact: Domestic firms better navigate the challenges arising from political pluralism, an institutional feature characterized by a lack of political alignment between national and subnational governments. In the presence of political alignment, domestic firms do not have a comparative advantage over foreign firms. Our evidence thus highlights that even an uncertain and transitory window of opportunity arising from a controversial reduction in competition from the public sector can lead to a fundamental market restructuring in ways that can diverge from the intended policy objective. In particular, domestic firms’ ability to manage political pluralism is a core mechanism explaining their comparative advantage over foreign firms in the wake of a national crisis.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by the National University of Singapore [Start-Up Research Grant A-0003843-00-00], the University of Minnesota [Summer Research Grant], and the Indian School of Business [Research Grant].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06174 .</content>

We study the effects of competition and interoperability regulation in platform markets. To do so, we propose an approach of competition in net fees, which is well-suited to situations in which users pay additional charges, after joining, for on-platform interactions. Compared with existing approaches, the net fee model expands the tractable scope to allow variable total demand, platform asymmetry, and merger analysis. Regarding competition, we find that adding more platforms to the market may lead to the emergence of a dominant firm. In contrast, we find that interoperability can play a key role in reducing market dominance and lowering prices. Broadly speaking, our results favor policy interventions that assure the formidability of the competition that dominant platforms face.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: L.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Amid the rise of the influencer economy, fake social media accounts have become prevalent on many social media platforms. Yet the problem of fake accounts is still poorly understood, and so is the effectiveness of coping strategies. This research models the ecosystem of fake accounts in an influencer economy and obtains insights on fake account purchasing behaviors, the impact of antifake efforts, and the roles of various contextual factors. We show that as the antifake effort increases, the equilibrium may transition from a “pooling” equilibrium, where a low-quality influencer buys fake accounts to mimic a high-quality one, to a “costly separating” equilibrium, where a high-quality influencer may buy fake accounts to prevent mimicry from a low-quality influencer, and to a “naturally separating” equilibrium where low- and high-quality influencers are separated without buying fake accounts. We find that increasing antifake efforts and increasing social media literacy may sometimes result in more fake accounts. A purely profit-driven platform always prefers a pooling equilibrium with zero antifake effort. As a platform puts more weight on consumer welfare, it may exert a positive effort to induce a separating equilibrium, but the platform’s preferred antifake effort tends to be lower than that of consumers. We also find that the platform sometimes prefers a lower social media literacy and a lower fake account base price, whereas consumers prefer the opposite. In contrast, improving the antifake technology level can benefit both the platform and consumers. Our main insights are applicable to scenarios with more influencer types and repeated interactions.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <title>Causal Mechanisms in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Management: A Meta‐Synthesis of Micro‐CSR Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Much psychologically oriented micro‐CSR research emphasizesintra‐individual processes, leading to a relative omission of the role of interactions among individuals in managing CSR. This limitation hinders the potential of such micro‐CSR research to explain CSR as an organizational‐level outcome. We adopt a meta‐synthesis methodology to extract insights oninter‐individual processes in CSR management from existing literature that examines CSR's microfoundations beyond a purely psychological perspective. By incorporating a causal mechanism approach into our meta‐synthesis, we develop a theoretical framework comprising three causal mechanisms that elucidate how individual behaviours and interactions of differing sets of dominant actor types (including change agents, supporters, opportunists, resisters and top and senior management) foster substantive or incremental progress in CSR or its obstruction within firms. Our findings establish a foundation for further research into individual‐level and temporal dynamics in CSR management, and the conditions under which firms are more likely to implement impactful CSR initiatives.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This special issue advances our understanding of organizing and strategizing in extreme contexts by focusing on temporality, emotions, and embodiment. Extreme contexts – marked by unpredictability, high stakes, and urgency – challenge organizational capacities and demand innovative responses. Drawing on the foundation of extreme context research, this introduction explores three perspectives: extreme as an event, a situational context, and a socially constructed practice. Together, these perspectives illuminate how organizations navigate, adapt to, and construct extremeness through temporal, emotional, and embodied processes. The contributions span diverse empirical settings and theoretical frameworks. By examining the contributions in the light of these dimensions, this introduction highlights the evolving and contested nature of extreme context research. The introduction concludes with a call for future studies to deepen engagement with materiality, relational dynamics, and methodological innovations, reinforcing the relevance of this field to broader management and organization studies.</content>

    <title>Born to Wait? A Study on Allocation Rules in Booking Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Queue-based rules for allocating scarce goods are widely utilized in booking systems due to their perceived efficiency. However, empirical investigations into the externalities and opportunity costs of queuing in multitasking scenarios are limited. This paper reports on two laboratory experiments that compare a queue-based rule with a lottery-based rule by quantifying their respective efficiency losses. Our findings indicate that while the queue-based rule demonstrates superior allocative efficiency, it incurs significant losses in productive efficiency attributed to opportunity costs of time. In contrast, the lottery-based rule exhibits improved overall efficiency with minimal time spent on the booking system. Additionally, under the queue-based rule, participants display bimodal behavior, either engaging fully or abstaining from the booking system, influenced by their time valuations. Furthermore, while providing queue length information facilitates more efficient coordination, it also leads to more frequent task-switching behavior that negates any productive efficiency gained from improved coordination. This research underscores the crucial need to reevaluate allocation mechanisms in booking systems, taking into account their externalities.</content>

    <title>Faster Deliveries and Smarter Order Assignments for an On‐Demand Meal Delivery Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rapid growth of on‐demand meal delivery platforms has heightened competition, making customer retention a critical priority. While prior research on order dispatch algorithms has largely focused on minimizing delivery time or delay, the direct impact of delivery performance on repeat purchases remains underexplored. Using transactional data from an online meal delivery platform in China, we empirically investigate the asymmetric effects of early and late deliveries on customer repurchasing behavior. To address potential endogeneity, we introduce driver experience and local knowledge, two previously overlooked factors in platform algorithms, as novel instrumental variables. The survival analysis shows that late deliveries significantly reduce future orders, while early deliveries provide only limited benefits. Guided by these empirical insights, we develop a simulation‐based evaluation of different order dispatch algorithms, revealing that maximizing future orders, rather than minimizing delivery time or delays, yields the highest future orders. These insights offer actionable recommendations for platform managers, stressing the importance of strategic adjustments in dispatch algorithms and integrating heterogeneous treatment effects into algorithmic design. By merging operational delivery performance with consumer behavior insights through causal inference and optimization, this study provides a novel end‐to‐end framework for creating data‐driven dispatch algorithms that enhance both service efficiency and customer retention.</content>

    <title>Awe‐inspired: Appraising awe's consequences for consumers and brands</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article builds on Keltner's conceptual model of awe, innovation, and choice (Keltner, 2025). This article expands on the framework in two main ways by outlining (1) when awe could have positive versus negative consequences for consumer choice and (2) how focusing on distinctive aspects of the consumer behavior setting may further enhance understanding of awe. Building on these themes, this article proposes several areas for research: examining granular aspects of the core appraisals, further characterizing different cognitive functions, considering consequences for different consumer choice domains (e.g., decision making, indulgence, customization), and focusing on how different kinds of relationships (e.g., brand communities), types of prosocial action (e.g., donating vs. volunteering), and forms of brand generated awe (direct vs. indirect) impact consumer behavior. This article offers specific propositions to encourage future research on how awe may impact consumers and brands.</content>

    <title>Growing Platforms by Adding Complementors Without a Contract</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practitioner-Oriented AbstractOnline platforms often face challenges in sustaining growth, especially in competitive markets such as food delivery. This paper examines a novel strategy in which platforms list nonpartnered restaurants, allowing consumers to order from them via third-party deliverers. Whereas these restaurants gain visibility without paying commissions, concerns arise about potential harm because of lack of control over menus and pricing.We analyze the impact of this strategy using data from Grubhub and a California policy change that banned nonpartnered listings. We find that being listed as nonpartnered boosts takeout revenue for these restaurants, particularly independent ones. Additionally, there’s a positive spillover effect on partnered restaurants. However, regulatory delisting reverses these gains, highlighting the delicate balance between platform growth strategies and regulatory actions.For platform owners, this study underscores the potential of noncontracted partnerships as a growth strategy, especially if there are third-party enablers on the platform such as deliverers. However, it also cautions against potential disruptions from regulatory changes, urging businesses to adapt their strategies accordingly.For restaurant owners, our finding emphasizes the importance of adapting to changes by enhancing operational readiness to capitalize on increased visibility. They should advocate for regulations that enhance their choices and overall transparency, not inadvertently decrease them.Policy-Oriented AbstractIn the competitive landscape of online platforms, the pursuit of growth often necessitates innovative strategies. Whereas such strategies are deemed controversial and get pushbacks from some participants, how should policymakers respond?This research provides insights into such a scenario by investigating a novel growth strategy in which food delivery platforms onboarded nonpartnered restaurants, enabling consumer interactions without formal contracts, promising an increased visibility without commission fees. Leveraging data from Grubhub and a policy change in California, we find that being listed boosts takeout revenue significantly, especially for independent restaurants, with positive spillovers on partnered restaurants. However, delisting reverses these gains.For policymakers, these findings challenge the narrative that nonpartnered listings are inherently harmful. They highlight the potential of such arrangements to increase market access and revenue, particularly for independent businesses. However, the study also underscores the need for balanced regulation. Whereas protecting restaurants is crucial, overly restrictive policies can limit their choices and growth opportunities.We recommend a policy approach that empowers restaurants by requiring platforms to obtain explicit consent before listing them. Additionally, enhancing transparency around nonpartnered listings and associated fees can enable customers to make informed choices. This approach fosters a fair market, preserving the benefits of platform-enabled growth for all stakeholders.</content>

    <title>Normalization: How Organizations Socialize Newcomers to Make the Extraordinary Seem Ordinary</title>
    <updated>2025-02-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Blake E. Ashforth</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does an organization take a raw recruit and have them dispose of bombs, slaughter animals, or work in polar research stations? I argue that the answer is through socializing them so that they come to view the extraordinary as more ordinary. This “normalization” typically entails: (1) setting the context by creating a strong situation in the form of a social cocoon with high normative control; (2) setting the content by providing a clear frame and ideology, conveyed through various forms of discourse; and (3) setting the process of socialization in motion by recruiting and selecting promising individuals and subjecting them to synergistic combinations of divestiture and investiture and of incrementalism and immersion, routinizing the work, and facilitating stress coping. These practices are mutually reinforcing such that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. The outcome is newcomers who can take in stride and accomplish what may have once seemed unthinkable. However, the socialization process is largely the same whether the goals are socially desirable (e.g., pursuing a grand challenge) or socially undesirable (e.g., extremism), and whether the means are socially desirable (most work) or undesirable (e.g., “dirty work”). I conclude with a discussion of the ethical implications of normalizing, a summary of common managerial practices for normalizing, and directions for future research.</content>

    <title>Something in the air: does air pollution affect fund managers’ carbon divestment?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether mutual fund managers overestimate carbon risk when they are exposed to local air pollution. We find that air pollution near fund managers induces them to underweight stocks of high-emission firms. The effects strengthen among environmentally conscious fund managers and among those likely to be surprised by air pollution—consistent with the idea that managers revise their beliefs about carbon risk following exposure to air pollution. A firm’s carbon-emissions disclosures and fund managers’ sophistication moderate these effects. Carbon-intensive stocks sold by fund managers who are exposed to local air pollution subsequently outperform stocks they buy, suggesting that such underweighting is costly to fund investors.</content>

    <title>Micro MPCs and Macro Counterfactuals: The Case of the 2008 Rebates</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present evidence that the high estimated MPCs from the leading household studies result in implausible macroeconomic counterfactuals. Using the 2008 tax rebate as a case study, we calibrate a standard macro model with the estimated micro MPCs to construct counterfactual macroeconomic consumption paths in the absence of a rebate. The counterfactual paths imply that consumption expenditures would have plummeted in spring and summer 2008 and then mostly recovered in September 2008. We use narratives and forecasts to argue that these paths are implausible. We then show that standard two-way fixed effect estimates of the micro MPCs are upward biased. When we correct for the biases, we estimate smaller micro MPCs using the CEX data than the previous literature. We also show that realistic modifications of the model result in general equilibrium forces that dampen rather than amplify micro MPCs. The combination of smaller micro MPCs and dampening general equilibrium forces implies general equilibrium consumption multipliers that are below 0.2.</content>

    <title>A Monetary-Fiscal Theory of Sudden Inflations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper posits an information channel as an explanation for sudden inflations. Households saving via nominal government bonds face a choice whether to acquire costly information about future government surpluses. They trade off the cost of acquiring information about the surpluses that back bond repayment against the benefit of a more informed saving decision. Through the information channel, small changes in the economic environment can trigger large responses in consumers’ behavior and prices. This setting explains why there can be long stretches of time during which government surpluses have large movements with little inflation response; yet, at some point, something snaps, and a sudden inflation takes off that is strongly responsive to incoming fiscal news.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Utilizing the introduction of the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) as an exogenous shock to enhance secondary bond market transparency, we investigate the informational feedback effect of the bond market on supplier innovation in vertical relationships. We find that the increased availability of trading details regarding major customers’ outstanding bonds significantly fosters their supplier firms’ innovative investment. This positive effect of bond market transparency enhancements on supplier innovation is weakened when major customers demonstrate a better information environment, have higher levels of institutional ownership, and share common institutional investors with suppliers, while strengthened when the bond market conveys positive information about major customers, and when major customers face tighter financial constraints, exhibit higher levels of risk-taking, and possess greater importance to suppliers. Our findings clearly identify the informational role of the bond market in corporate investment decisions and specifically highlight the importance of bond market information regarding customer firms to the innovation along the supply chain.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the multi-armed bandit framework, there are two formulations that are commonly employed to handle time-varying reward distributions: adversarial bandit and nonstationary bandit. Although their oracles, algorithms, and regret analysis differ significantly, we provide a unified formulation in this article that smoothly bridges the two as special cases. The formulation uses an oracle that takes the best action sequences within a switch budget. Depending on the switch budget, it turns into the oracle in hindsight in the adversarial bandit and the dynamic oracle in the nonstationary bandit. We provide algorithms that attain the optimal regret with the matching lower bound. The optimal regret displays distinct behavior in two regimes.</content>

    <title>Delegation Versus Control Mechanism: Impacts on Second-Hand Markets With Product Upgrades</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The second-hand market (SM) trades used products from the reverse channel. In practice, manufacturers such as Apple Inc. collect used products and sell refurbished products in the SM. However, third-party firms (TPFs) such as Gazelle independently manage the SM. Alternatively, the manufacturer may delegate the responsibility of managing the SM to a TPF under a contract or choose to operate in the SM with a TPF serving as a competitor. The optimal strategy to manage the SM is an important operations issue for the manufacturer as well as the TPF. This decision becomes even more critical when the manufacturer plans to sell the upgraded version, markdown version, and remanufactured version of the product concurrently. In the presence of product competition, SM selling can affect the prices and sales of the markdown product as well as the upgraded product. Therefore, in this study, we analyze impacts of the manufacturer’s choice of delegation. Our analytical findings reveal that the SM selling strongly influences the equilibrium price and the demand for the markdown product offered by the manufacturer under all the mechanisms. However, demand cannibalization of the markdown product is most severe under the delegation mechanism. Additionally, we counter-intuitively reveal that the manufacturer is better-off under the delegation mechanism when the sales commission is low and remanufacturing cost is high. In fact, the delegation mechanism is found to be the most profitable arrangement for the manufacturer as well as the TPF. Interestingly, demand for the upgraded version product remains unaffected by SM sales under the independent TPF mechanism, allowing the manufacturer to launch the upgraded version product without any fear of demand cannibalization. Furthermore, we discover that consumers secure the maximum surplus under the competitive scenario owing to intense price competitiveness. For robustness checking, we further extend our model to consider the cases with variable remanufacturing cost, differential emission cost, environmental cost, and collection rate of used product.</content>

    <title>Looking at the Trees to See the Forest: Construal Level Shift in Strategic Problem Framing and Formulation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Effective strategy development, evaluation, and implementation starts with a comprehensive understanding of strategic problems. However, developing such an understanding is often challenging due to the complexity of such problems and because how they can be solved is not yet known. Managers often oversimplify these problems by focusing on a few symptoms and obvious causes. Research indicates that big picture, abstract thinking helps managers explore underlying causes more flexibly, but it can also lead to overlooking key symptoms that do not fit existing frameworks. Instead, concrete thinking is likely essential for individuals to identify the full range of symptoms characterizing strategic problems. Because symptoms are essential for fully understanding strategic problems—they are the building blocks for managers to build theories about causes—both concrete and abstract thinking may be necessary. Drawing on construal level theory, we propose a construal level shift model. The central claim of our model is that managers benefit from first adopting a low construal level (concrete) thinking when framing strategic problems to identify all relevant symptoms. The benefit of a high construal level (abstract) thinking lies in combining these symptoms more flexibly to theorize more comprehensively about the underlying causes. Two experimental studies and one correlational study, involving samples of working individuals, managers, and experienced executives, support our model. Our findings contribute to the behavioral and knowledge-based views of the firm, the theory-based view of strategy, and managerial cognition research.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.19134 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New Insights into Off-line Estimation for Controlled Markov Chains UnveiledA team of researchers from Purdue and Northwestern Universities have unveiled new findings in off-line estimation for controlled Markov chains, addressing challenges in analyzing complex data generated under arbitrary dynamics. The study introduces a nonparametric estimator for transition probabilities, showcasing its robustness even in nonstationary, non-Markovian environments.The team developed precise sample complexity bounds, revealing a delicate interplay between mixing properties of the logging policy and data set size. Their analysis highlights how achieving optimal statistical risk depends on this trade-off, broadening the scope of off-line estimation under diverse conditions. Examples include ergodic and weakly ergodic chains as well as controlled chains with episodic or greedy controls.Significantly, this research confirms that the widely used estimator, which calculates state–action transition ratios, is minimax optimal, ensuring its reliability in general scenarios. This advancement paves the way for improved evaluation of stationary Markov control policies, marking a breakthrough in understanding complex off-line systems.</content>

    <title>On Greedy-Like Policies in Online Matching with Reusable Network Resources and Decaying Rewards</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We build a unified modeling framework for classical online matching problems and emerging online matching problems with three additional practical features: reusable resources, network resources, and decaying rewards. For online matching problems in the unified framework, we provide a unified performance analysis tool for the greedy policy and its simple variants, which we refer to as greedy-like policies. We prove that greedy-like policies can achieve near-optimal performances for online matching problems in the unified framework, where the policy performance is measured by competitive ratios under adversarial environments. We then analyze several representative special classes of online matching problems, which incorporate additional realistic structural assumptions on top of the unified framework. Specifically, we consider online matching problems with each of the following three additional structures: (i) singleton resources with time-decaying rewards; (ii) network resources with accept/reject decisions; and (iii) network resources with interval-type bundles. We show that for these special classes of online matching problems, slight modifications to greedy-like policies can successfully utilize additional structural information to further enhance policy performances. This work may suggest that the greedy policy and its variants, despite its simplicity, can achieve reliable performances for a number of emerging online matching problems.This paper was accepted by J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Martin K. Starr, aged 97, passed away January 25, 2025. During his 15-year tenure as editor-in-chief of Management Science, he became the longest serving editor of any INFORMS journal. During this period, he published dozens of books and more than 100 articles. Starr made significant contributions to delineating the domain of modern operations and supply chain management, building a framework for system integration, modular design and production, and high-risk systems. This essay intends to underscore Martin Starr’s contributions to the field of management science, particularly emphasizing the crucial connection between theoretical analysis and practical applications in management.</content>

    <title>Evaluating Mortgage Renegotiation Strategies: A Data-Driven Framework for Investors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper offers a novel framework to quantify the expected gains from renegotiating delinquent loans. The framework accounts for important trade-offs between concessions to borrowers, postdelinquency loan performance, and expected collateral values. The framework’s parameters are calibrated using data on renegotiated 30-year residential fixed-rate mortgages that went delinquent during the Great Recession. Our model-implied expected gains increase during the 2007–2009 period coinciding with an increase in the rate of loan renegotiation. Counterfactual analyses show that larger expected gains can be generated from employing principal forbearance and extensions of the term to maturity compared with principal write-downs and interest-rate reductions. On the other hand, principal write-downs can be a powerful tool when borrowers are deeply underwater. Our analyses illustrate how lenders or policymakers might deploy this framework when faced with another delinquency crisis.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Funding: The author thanks the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and the Center for Investors and Financial Markets at the University of Virginia for funding for this paper.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02672 .</content>

    <title>Following in the Footsteps of Others: Social Proof in Angel Groups</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study develops a theory of social proof in angel investing. We propose that availability bias leads angel group members to copy the highly visible decisions of new investors evaluating the same opportunity ( external social proof) and overlook the more insightful reinvestment decisions of prior investors ( internal social proof). We also theorize that more experienced investors generally herd less but selectively imitate knowledgeable investors from prior rounds. A study of investments by 469 angel group members and a vignette experiment with 367 participants support our hypotheses. Our findings contribute to research on social proof, decision-making under uncertainty, and investment experience.</content>
