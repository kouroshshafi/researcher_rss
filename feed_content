    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a macroeconomic theory where demand for goods has a productive role. A search friction prevents perfect matching between producers and potential customers. Larger demand induces more search, which, in turn, increases GDP and measured total factor productivity (TFP). We embed the product-market friction in a standard neoclassical model and estimate it using Bayesian techniques. Business cycles are driven by preference shocks, true technology shocks, and investment-specific shocks. Preference shocks have qualitatively similar effects as true productivity shocks. These shocks account for a large share of the fluctuations in consumption, GDP, and measured TFP and can be identified using shopping time data.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study markup cyclicality in a granular macroeconomic model with oligopolistic competition. We first characterize how firm, sectoral, and aggregate markups comove with output at different levels of aggregation in response to firm-level shocks. We then quantify the model’s ability to reproduce salient features of the cyclical properties of measured markups in French administrative firm-level data from the bottom (firm) level to the aggregate level. We document that (i) firm-level markups rise with market share and sector-level markups with concentration, (ii) the relationship between markups and sectoral output varies by firm size–negative for small firms but positive for large ones, (iii) sector-level markups move positively with sectoral output, and (iv) sectoral markups show no systematic relationship with aggregate output. Our model helps rationalize these seemingly conflicting patterns of markup cyclicality in the data.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Smarter Load Balancing with Fewer MessagesModern data centers rely on real-time information to route jobs efficiently—but constant communication between servers and load balancers can overwhelm the network. In their paper, “Load Balancing Using Sparse Communication,” Gal Mendelson and Kuang Xu present a breakthrough: high-performance load balancing using drastically fewer messages. They introduce a flexible framework based on state approximation and develop new algorithms and communication protocols that maintain near-optimal performance even when communication is sparse. The key insight is that servers can monitor how wrong the load balancer’s estimate is and communicate only when necessary. Their approach reduces communication by over 90% while sacrificing little quality, as proven through both theory and simulation. These results offer a scalable and practical solution for large service systems where bandwidth is precious.</content>

    <title>Career Success and Minority Status: A Review and Conceptual Framework</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, the management field has witnessed a surge in studies examining career success among workers from historically marginalized minority groups. However, to date, insights gained from this research remain fragmented and have not been integrated into the existing career success frameworks. We aim to complement career success scholarship and contribute to its inclusivity by conducting a systematic review that synthesizes the factors and pathways contributing to the career success of four historically underrepresented minority groups: women, racial and ethnic minorities, individuals with disabilities, and the LGBTQ+ community. Evidencing that career success disparity can be attributed to minority status, we propose a framework that highlights the career advancement and human and psychological resources associated with minority groups’ career success, as well as the systemic barriers limiting access to and use of such resources. We suggest hypervisibility, invisibility, and managed visibility as distinguishable forms of identity-based mechanisms that offer theoretical explanations for the influence of marginalized identity status on career success. Our framework integrates manifestations of subjective career success—accounting for survival, the collective good, and adjustability in addition to what extant literature has shown—emphasizing that membership in marginalized groups, communities, and other identity-relevant contexts shapes the subjective meaning of career success. Our review has practical implications for decision makers and organizations intending to bridge minority and nonminority groups’ career success disparity.</content>

    <title>The Unexpected Upside of High Language Diversity: Social Integration Through Language Advice Networks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While the corporate lingua franca mandate aims to facilitate communications among linguistically diverse employees, evidence shows that it creates more problems than it solves, often negatively affecting social integration and knowledge sharing in the workplace. Our study is driven by the phenomenon of high language diversity and low lingua franca proficiency, emerging characteristics of workplaces around the globe given increasing migration. We adopt a mixed-methods, longitudinal design involving participant observations, interviews, social network surveys, and company data. Our analysis revealed the existence and prevalence of an informal language advice network (LAN) in which individuals with varying levels of English proficiency actively engage in voluntary language-related knowledge-seeking and sharing. We found more positive interpersonal interactions and consequences of LAN than typically reported in extant studies. We leverage the social networks and generalized exchange literature to explain the processes and consequences of LAN for individuals and the organization. Management recognition was found to be important for sustaining LAN in a context of high language diversity. Our integrative analytical framework offers a valuable lens for scholarship on future workplaces that are being shaped by rapidly shifting ethnic, cultural, and linguistic demography.</content>

    <title>The effects of government debt on corporate borrowing in developing economies: evidence from Africa</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many African economies face high debt levels, yet local firms have unique growth opportunities requiring external financing. We examine whether government borrowing constrains corporate financing in Africa and how these effects differ by debt source. Using a manually collected dataset from 29 African countries (2000–2019), we uncover financing patterns that challenge conventional theories. In sharp contrast to firms in developed markets, we find that African firms experience a “crowding-in” effect when governments borrow externally, enhancing their access to debt. In contrast, domestic government borrowing induces the typical crowding-out effect, where government borrowing reduces corporate access to debt. The crowding-in phenomenon is most evident among publicly listed firms, particularly those cross-listed on foreign exchanges (the multinationals). The effect strengthens in countries with higher Eurobond market activity and intensifies following sovereign credit downgrades, underscoring the sovereign ceiling’s constraint on corporate borrowing. Our findings contribute significantly to international business literature by revealing how African debt markets function differently, highlighting unique financing challenges faced by African multinational enterprises, and demonstrating that economic principles established in developed markets cannot be universally applied to emerging economies. These insights are crucial for designing effective policies to support corporate growth in Africa.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Old but Gold? Product Design Innovation and the Value of Used Products in Secondhand Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An important global trend today is the rise of the secondhand market powered by consumers’ desire for sustainability and affordability, as well as a surge in the use of digital resale platforms. While marketing research has primarily focused on the success of new product markets, scant research has tried to understand secondhand markets. To advance knowledge in this area, we investigate how product design innovation affects the value of used products in secondhand markets. Specifically, we develop a framework of theintertemporal distinctiveness of a used product’s design, defined as the extent to which the design of a used product is distinct from the newest design of the same product. We use image-processing software to analyze product pictures and quantify the intertemporal distinctiveness of design. Analyzing a unique dataset of used cars sold in the U.S. automotive market, we find a U-shaped relationship between the intertemporal distinctiveness of design and the resale price of used products. Moreover, we find that the effect of intertemporal distinctiveness is moderated by thewithin-category distinctiveness of a used product, defined as the extent to which a used product’s design is distinct from other used products in the same product category. This study contributes to the research on product design and the determinants of resale prices, providing practical implications for consumers, manufacturers, and dealers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Optimal Bidding, Allocation, and Budget Spending for a Demand-Side Platform with Generic Auctions</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a practical optimization model for the management of a demand-side platform (DSP), which is applicable in static planning situations where the DSP acquires valuable impressions for high-volume advertiser clients in a real-time bidding environment. We propose a highly flexible model for the DSP to maximize its profit while maintaining acceptable levels of budget spending for its advertisers. Our model achieves flexibility and improved performance primarily through two different aspects: (i) we replace standard budget constraints with a more general budget utilization proxy function over budget spending levels, and (ii) we can accommodate arbitrary auction types by directly modeling the interactions between the DSP and the auctions. Our proposed formulation leads to a non-convex optimization problem due to the joint optimization over both impression allocation and bid price decisions. Using Fenchel duality theory, we obtain a convex dual problem that can be efficiently solved with subgradient based algorithms and from which a primal solution may be recovered efficiently. Under a natural and intuitive "increasing marginal cost" condition, as well as under a more general condition, we show that there is zero duality gap between the dual problem and the original non-convex primal problem. Under the same conditions, we also demonstrate convergence of our algorithm to an optimal solution of the non-convex formulation as the dual problem is solved to near optimality. We conduct experiments on both synthetic data as well as data from a real DSP, and our results demonstrate how our algorithm allows the DSP to better trade off between profitability and budget spending as compared to a widely used "greedy" heuristic approach.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Robust Monopoly Pricing with Asymmetric Information</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates a robust monopoly pricing problem, where a seller seeks tomaximize expected revenue when selling a product to a buyer with limited information, specifically knowing only the mean, variance, and asymmetric information (semivariance) of the buyer’s valuation distribution. We explore both deterministic and randomized pricing strategies and evaluate their performance under these constraints. We formulate two maximin problems aimed at maximizing the worst-case expected revenues. By employing the primal-dual approach in infinite linear programming, we derive the closed-form for the optimal pricing strategies for both maximin problems. Our results show that incorporating semivariance significantly enhances the performance of pricing strategies by better capturing distributional asymmetry. Additionally, we compare the performance of deterministic and randomized pricing in various scenarios, offering valuable insights into how risk and reward can be effectively balanced. Moreover, our results on both pricing strategies provide new bounds for the value of personalized pricing. This comprehensive analysis enables a deeper understanding of semivariance information to improve decision-making and offer practical insights for managing complex pricing decisions.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Patent Litigation Risk and Firm Boundaries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The increasing prevalence of patent infringement litigation in recent decades has imposed significant costs on firms. This paper empirically examines how this legal risk influences a key operational decision: vertical integration. Drawing on the real options theory (ROT), we argue that managers reduce the extent of vertical integration to preserve flexibility and make operational adjustments in anticipation of unfavorable outcomes from patent lawsuits. Using a dataset of public firms and a text-based measure of vertical integration, our findings show that firms facing higher patent litigation risk are less vertically integrated. At the same time, these firms maintain broader supplier networks and product market scopes, consistent with a preference for leveraging market mechanisms to reduce the costs of exercising switch and exit options. The negative relationship between litigation risk and vertical integration is particularly pronounced in durable goods sectors and declining industries, where the ability to divest or halt operations is highly valued. Additionally, we find that firms diversify their supplier base and product and technology portfolios after facing patent lawsuits. However, more vertically integrated firms are slower to make these adjustments, suggesting that they encounter greater friction in exercising real options. Overall, our study highlights the significant role that intellectual property disputes play in shaping corporate vertical integration strategies.</content>

    <title>Robust Optimization with Decision-Dependent Information Discovery</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Robust optimization (RO) is a popular paradigm for modeling and solving two- and multistage decision-making problems affected by uncertainty. In many real-world applications, such as R&amp;D project selection, production planning, or preference elicitation for product or policy recommendations, the time of information discovery is decision-dependent and the uncertain parameters only become observable after an often costly investment. Yet, most of the literature on robust optimization assumes that the uncertain parameters can be observed for free and that the sequence in which they are revealed is independent of the decision-maker’s actions. To fill this gap in the practicability of RO, we consider two- and multistage robust optimization problems in which part of the decision variables control the time of information discovery. Thus, information available at any given time is decision-dependent and can be discovered (at least in part) by making strategic exploratory investments in previous stages. We propose a novel dynamic formulation of the problem and prove its correctness. We leverage our model to provide a solution method inspired from the K-adaptability approximation, whereby K candidate strategies for each decision stage are chosen here-and-now and, at the beginning of each period, the best of these strategies is selected after the uncertain parameters that were chosen to be observed are revealed. We reformulate the problem as a finite mixed-integer (resp. bilinear) program if none (resp. some) of the decision variables are real-valued. This finite program is solvable with off-the-shelf solvers. We generalize our approach to the minimization of piecewise linear convex functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of usability, optimality, and speed on synthetic instances of the Pandora box problem, the preference elicitation problem with real-valued recommendations, the best box problem, and the R&amp;D project portfolio optimization problem. Finally, we evaluate it on an instance of the active preference elicitation problem used to recommend kidney allocation policies to policy-makers at the United Network for Organ Sharing based on real data from the U.S. Kidney Allocation System.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: This work was supported primarily by the Operations Engineering Program of the National Science Foundation under NSF Award No. 1763108.

    <title>Beyond reductionism: rethinking MNEs’ role in environmental crises</title>
    <updated>2025-06-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This counterpoint challenges the view advanced by Yu, Bansal, and Arjaliès (J Int Business Stud 54:1151–1169, 2023), who argue that multinational enterprises (MNEs), by virtue of their cross-border operations, are inherently detrimental to the environment. While Yu et al.’s call for responsible resource use is commendable, we contend that their framework oversimplifies the complex realities of international business (IB). Drawing on New Internalization Theory (NIT), we examine environmental crises through the lens of multilevel complexity—macro-level institutional interdependencies, firm-level heterogeneity, and individual-level cognitive and behavioral constraints. Our approach underscores the role of bounded rationality and bounded reliability across all relevant actors—not just MNE managers—in shaping environmental outcomes. We find that Yu et al.’s proposed strategies give limited attention to the institutional, industry, organizational, and governance conditions under which environmental value is created. By contrast, we apply comparative institutional analysis to investigate MNEs’ impact on the environment as compared to feasible, real-world alternatives. We argue that meaningful environmental progress hinges not on targeting MNEs, but on fostering multilateral coordination among public, private, and civil society actors, with MNEs being well positioned to lead such collaborations. We call for scholarship that avoids ideological overreach, embraces IB theory, and acknowledges MNEs as key agents in advancing environmental sustainability.</content>

    <title>Why (and When) Are Uncertain Price Promotions More Effective Than Equivalent Sure Discounts?</title>
    <updated>2025-06-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Celia Gaertig, Joseph P Simmons</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Past research suggests that offering customers a probabilistic promotion, such as an X% chance to get a product for free, is often more effective than providing a sure discount of equal expected value. In five studies (N = 8,969), we find that probabilistic price promotions are more effective than equivalent sure discounts only when those sure discounts are or seem trivial. Specifically, we find that probabilistic promotions are relatively more effective (1) when the sure discounts are actually smaller, (2) when the sure discounts are made to feel smaller by presenting them alongside a larger discount, and (3) when the sure discounts are made to feel smaller by framing them as a percentage discount rather than a dollar amount. These findings are inconsistent with two leading explanations of consumers’ preferences for probabilistic promotions—diminishing sensitivity and the overweighting of small probabilities—and suggest that people’s preferences for uncertainty are more strongly tethered to their perceptions of the size of the sure outcome than they are to their perceptions of the probability of getting the uncertain reward.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizational theory has predominantly studied elites, yielding significant insights but creating a narrow perspective on management practices and organizational dynamics. This essay argues that we can advance organizational theory by incorporating a comprehensive focus on populations marginalized across multiple dimensions—economic, educational, geographic, demographic, cultural, and social. Addressing these marginalized groups is crucial as they face barriers, stigma, and discrimination, which are often overlooked in elite-focused research. By bringing greater attention to marginalized populations and embracing an intersectional approach focused on multiple dimensions of marginalization, we have the opportunity to broaden the scope of management research, foster inclusivity, and better reflect the diverse realities of organizational life. This essay provides definitions, operationalizations, and exemplary articles for each dimension of marginalization, ultimately advocating a more comprehensive and inclusive perspective in organizational research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are increasingly facing decisions about operations in markets affected by geopolitical conflicts that attract global attention, but research that illuminates the consequences of these decisions remains scarce. We develop a theoretical framework that integrates rational expectations theory with the person-situation framework to explain how investors react to firms' operational decisions in such markets. Using Russia's war in Ukraine as our empirical context, we analyze 289 announcements by 237 firms publicly traded in the US and UK during the first month of the conflict. We find that firms announcing a suspension of their operations experience more negative short-term market reactions than firms announcing continued operations. However, these negative reactions are attenuated when suspensions are more anticipated due to prior competitor suspensions, higher public interest in the conflict, larger firm operational footprint in the affected market, and greater pre-conflict media attention focused on the focal firms. This framework provides important insights for managers faced with both market pressures and stakeholder expectations during geopolitical crises, as well as a theoretical basis for scholars to further examine the consequences of turmoil in firms’ international markets.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: From Tools to Agents: Meta-Analytic Insights into Human Acceptance of AI</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more autonomous and socially present, it is critical to understand how people accept AI not just as a technological tool, but also as an agent capable of (semi-)autonomous decision-making and interaction. With a meta-analysis of 287 effect sizes representing over 119,000 individuals, this research examines the factors driving human acceptance of AI. Through a dual-perspectives framework, AI as a tool versus an agent, the authors identify key AI characteristics, including capability, role, expertise scope, and anthropomorphism, that significantly influence acceptance. These engineerable AI characteristics, along with contextual and individual factors, form an AI-task-user framework that explains AI acceptance across different use scenarios and user groups. These findings contribute to the discourse on AI acceptance and human-AI interactions: revealing a small, decreasing reluctance to accept AI and, more importantly, directing future research to empirical testing and theory building of AI acceptance from an agentic perspective. This research also provides actionable user-centered design roadmap for practitioners to develop and communicate AI features that align with human expectations and enhance positive responses, especially at a time when agentic AI is rapidly becoming a technological and societal reality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite being preventable and curable, cervical cancer (CC) claimed 350,000 lives globally in 2024 due to the low adoption of CC screening (CCS). An analysis of the institutional context in India revealed a lack of awareness and disempowering sociocultural stigma and norms as two critical barriers. Simultaneously, trustworthy spokespersons emerged as key enablers of CCS adoption. Three incentive-compatible randomized field experiments were conducted to evaluate the fit and effectiveness of message sources (doctorsvs.peers) and appeal (informative, highlighting the disease’s mortality risk, vs.empowering, addressing health/CCS-related sociocultural taboos) on CCS adoption. While doctors and peers drive greater adoption than infographics when delivering informational messages, willingness to pay is highest for doctors. However, the highest adoption occurs when peers conveyempoweringmessages. The authors also find that doctors and peers reduce the price sensitivity for CCS, a preventive service, relative to infographics. The research underscores the importance of congruence between credible sources and context-specific message appeals in enhancing adoption. Policymakers can prioritize low-cost, context-specific interventions that address sociocultural barriers by using peers as credible messengers. In India alone, this approach could boost adoption by 36.5% and enable 21.07 million more women to undergo CCS.</content>

    <title>If You Can't Let Go: The Role of Emotional Dependency in Global South–North Social Enterprises</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While social entrepreneurs' pro‐social motivation and other‐oriented emotions often drive their collaborative efforts to tackle grand challenges like poverty or gender inequality in the Global South, we know little about how collective emotions shape Global South–North partnerships over time. Drawing on a comparative longitudinal study of two Ugandan‐German social enterprise partnerships with the joint goal of achieving the Southern partner's self‐reliance, we problematize how collective emotions may lead to various stages of collective emotional dependency and hence foster postcolonial repercussions. We introduce collective emotional dependency as an inherent micro‐level mechanism that may manifest, surface, and become (dis‐)embedded beyond macro‐level dependencies. Our findings illustrate the double‐edged nature of the collective emotions in each phase of the partnership, as they can be both beneficial and detrimental. Our study shows that longstanding power inequalities, which South–North social enterprise partnerships set out to reduce in the first place, remain present in the everyday relational practices of organizing and collaborating.</content>

    <title>Critical Management Studies: From One‐Dimensional Critique to Three‐Dimensional Scepticism</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Critical Management Studies (CMS) has largely relied on one‐dimensional critique which focus on the negation of a dominant social order. This strong focus has made the field increasingly stale and preoccupied with standard objects for critique. This paper suggests that if CMS is to move beyond these problems, it needs to develop three‐dimensional thinking, including understanding, questioning, and reparation. Drawing on the idea of ‘reparative critique’ (Sedgwick, 1997), we outline what this looks like in practice and how it might be done by practitioners of CMS. We argue that reparative critique involves three steps of understanding, developed through empirical inquiry relaxing assumptions and thick description, critique developed through exploring dilemmas and examining ironies, and reparation which is created through deflation and concept creation. By working through these three steps, we think it is possible for CMS to move beyond identifying the ‘dark side’ and begin to identify positive visions for the future of management.</content>

    <title>Keep Up the Good Work… or Else! Exploring Supervisor Responses to Quiet Quitting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A Google search of “quiet quitting” yields over 350 million results, which is remarkable given that the term is only a few years old. Although quiet quitting is a relatively new trend, the concept it describes—an employee's conscious decision to do the bare minimum in their job rather than going above and beyond—is familiar to researchers who have investigated organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). However, for those interested in the effective management of human resources, what is important—yet unknown—is how managers respond to employees who engage in quiet quitting. Therefore, in this conceptual paper, we use attribution theory to explore supervisor responses to employees who engage in quiet quitting and subsequently withhold OCB. We propose that supervisors will generally have negative reactions to employees' withholding OCB, but we further explain how evaluations of locus, controllability, and stability and principles of discounting and augmenting influence supervisor attributions. Finally, implications for human resource theory, research, and practice are discussed.</content>

    <title>Generational imprints: A contingency approach to corruption and entrepreneurship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing research offers conflicting evidence on how corruption affects entrepreneurship. We adopt a contingency approach highlighting the role of generational imprinting. Drawing on imprinting and generational research, we argue entrepreneurs develop distinct generational imprints shaped by the environment during their formative years. Using a proprietary dataset of Chinese private firms, our findings suggest that in corrupt environments, market‐generation entrepreneurs with a transactional imprint tend to outperform their premarket‐generation counterparts in the short run, as the latter's principled imprint likely limits public relations spending. Personal life experiences—rural living and higher education—attenuate the influence of the transactional imprint, narrowing intergenerational differences in firm performance. Our study advances research on corruption and entrepreneurship by integrating institutional, generational, and individual‐level perspectives to explain how corruption affects entrepreneurs differently.Managerial SummaryThe relationship between corruption and entrepreneurship remains contested. Our study takes a novel angle by examining generational differences among entrepreneurs. We suggest that the distinct environments entrepreneurs experienced during adolescence shape their value orientations, leading to variation in firm performance in corrupt environments. Using a dataset of Chinese private firms, we show that, in corrupt environments, younger‐generation entrepreneurs with a transactional orientation (i.e., transactional imprint) tend to outperform older‐generation entrepreneurs with a principled orientation (i.e., principled imprint) in the short run. However, this performance gap narrows among those who lived in rural areas or received higher education. Our work highlights the crucial role of institutional environments in shaping entrepreneurs' values across generations and advocates for initiatives that cultivate more ethically grounded entrepreneurial mindsets.</content>

    <title>Paying off the Competition: Contracting, Market Power, and Innovation Incentives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores the relationship between a firm’s legal contracting environment and its innovation incentives. Using granular data from the pharmaceutical industry, we examine a contracting mechanism through which incumbents maintain market power: “pay-for-delay” agreements to delay the market entry of competitors. Exploiting a shock where such contracts become legally tenuous, we find that affected incumbents subsequently increase their innovation activity across a variety of project-level measures. Exploring the nature of this innovation, we also find that it is more “impactful” from a scientific and commercial standpoint. The results provide novel evidence that restricting the contracting space can boost innovation at the firm level. However, at the extensive margin we find a reduction in innovation by new entrants in response to increased competition, suggesting a nuanced effect on aggregate innovation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a comprehensive dataset of privacy policies, firm characteristics, consumer tracking, and cybersecurity incidents, we document several stylized facts about the heterogeneity of firms’ data extraction practices and the influence of privacy regulations. Rather than adopting standardized boilerplate privacy policies, we find substantial within-industry differences correlated with firms’ technical sophistication; firms engaging in data extraction have lengthier policies, seeking to hedge legal risks. Firms with intermediate technical sophistication appear to follow a “collect and share” model, collecting large amounts of consumer data and sharing it with third parties for processing, thus creating cybersecurity risks. Conversely, high sophistication firms appear to implement a “receive and process” model, consistent with a two-tier data market in which data flow from intermediate to high sophistication firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Observed international investment positions and cross-country heterogeneity in rates of return to capital are hard to reconcile with frictionless capital markets. In this paper, we develop a theory of international capital allocation: a multi-country dynamic spatial general equilibrium model in which the entire network of cross-border investment is endogenously determined. Our model features cross-country heterogeneity in fundamental risk, a demand system for international assets, and frictions that cause segmentation in international capital markets. We measure frictions affecting international investment and apply our model to data from nearly 100 countries, using a new dataset of international capital taxes and cultural, linguistic, and geographic distances between countries (geopoliticaldistance.org). Our model performs well in reproducing the composition of international portfolios, the cross-section of home bias and rates of return to capital, and other key features of international capital markets. Finally, we carry out counterfactual exercises: we show that barriers to international investment reduce world output by 7% and raise the cross-country dispersion of capital per employee, contributing in a meaningful way to global inequality.</content>

    <title>Disclosing Low Product Availability: An Online Platform’s Strategy for Mitigating Stockout Risk</title>
    <updated>2025-06-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ensuring product availability and successful order fulfillment are critical priorities for any retail company. In this paper, we explore how sharing information about low-availability items (LAIs) can influence customer purchase decisions both in preventing stockouts and mitigating their negative effects. The net impact of sharing information on LAIs is difficult to predict ex ante because multiple effects may act in opposite directions. On the one hand, sharing information could discourage LAI purchases from customers who are averse to stockouts. On the other hand, such information might increase the demand for LAIs because of cognitive biases that make scarce items seem more appealing. In a field experiment with more than 840,000 Instacart customers, we first find that customers are 25% less likely to purchase LAIs when item availability information is disclosed. This effect is not uniform; it is more pronounced when customers shop at new stores, when they have previously encountered lower found rates on the platform, and when they have less experience using the platform. Importantly, LAI disclosure has a positive impact on the platform’s performance in both the short and long term. Specifically, this innovative and extremely low-cost policy results in a 5.8% increase in customer spending and a 5.7% increase in order frequency over the long term. Our analysis suggests that this positive effect is driven by several factors: the improved service quality experienced by customers, as evidenced by a 3.7% reduction in refunds, a 2.9% decrease in product replacements, and a 7.5% reduction in poor product replacement ratings when replacements do occur; increased customer exploration of different stores; and higher spending per order because of fewer refunds and the exploration of potentially more expensive product substitutes. In the context of online retail, a policy of disclosing LAIs can improve customer decision-making by providing stock information, reduce stockouts, enhance satisfaction by managing expectations and transparency, and promote exploration of more platform options.This paper was accepted by Victor Martinez de Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01808 .</content>

    <title>Volatility During the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of COVID-19 on market volatility in an equilibrium framework. The model combines beliefs-dependent preferences for economic dynamics and a stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased (SEIRD) model with unpredictable birth/vaccine events and mitigating policies for disease propagation. The estimated model explains the realized trajectories of the S&amp;P 500 volatility and number of new cases and identifies the source and composition of the volatility spike while providing a good match for 25 unconditional moments of economic series. Beliefs dependence, in conjunction with real effects due to the short-term decline of the effective workforce early in the pandemic, is critical for this comprehensive explanation of short- and long-run properties. A model comparison study is performed. Out-of-sample volatility prediction exercises document that the good in-sample model fit for volatility and cases is not due to over-parametrization. The effects of alternative mitigation policies such as changes in contamination rate, shelter-in-place duration, and shelter-in-place compliance rate are examined. They document the tradeoff in number of cases and stock volatility during the pandemic, and the dominant role of unemployment news volatility.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04352 .</content>

    <title>Financial/Social Trade‐Offs in Dual‐Purpose Companies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dual‐purpose companies (DPCs) encounter numerous financial and social trade‐offs in their operations. However, existing research has not fully explored the heterogeneity and antecedents of these trade‐offs. To bridge this gap, we first distinguish between scenarios in which trade‐offs are mitigated or intensified, and then categorize the intensification into two directions: social dominance and financial dominance. We hypothesize that unique combinations of governance arrangements and organizational capabilities result in different trade‐off scenarios. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a fsQCA of 46 subsidiaries within a Chinese state‐owned enterprise group. We identify three patterns that mitigate trade‐offs and three patterns that intensify them. The findings highlight the complex interplay between governance mechanisms and organizational capabilities related to different trade‐off scenarios, and the diverse pathways towards trade‐off mitigation, and the causal asymmetry between patterns of different trade‐off scenarios. Overall, this study advances our understanding of the heterogeneity of financial/social trade‐offs in DPCs.</content>

    <title>ESG Rating Competition and Rating Quality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how increased competition among environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rating agencies relates to ESG rating quality. We exploit the entry of Sustainalytics as a new ESG rating agency in 2010. We conduct a difference‐in‐differences analysis and provide three main findings. First, we find that higher competition decreases incumbents' ESG rating disagreements of the same scope. The negative relation between competition and ESG rating disagreement persists for same‐scope rating metrics not covered by Sustainalytics, suggesting that neither learning nor herding drive the results. The relationship between competition and rating disagreement strengthens for firms with more ESG disclosures, which generally require more effort to analyze. Second, we find that incumbents' ratings of ESG concerns are more strongly associated with future negative ESG news for firms additionally covered by Sustainalytics. This finding is consistent with competition improving ratings' ability to predict future negative ESG incidents. Third, we find that incumbents evaluate more difficult‐to‐measure outcome metrics for firms covered by Sustainalytics, consistent with competition inducing more effort. Overall, our findings suggest that competition serves as an implicit disciplining mechanism of ESG rating agencies' quality.</content>

    <title>Data Donations for Digital Contact Tracing: Short- and Long-Term Effects of Monetary Incentives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractData donations promise to unlock the social benefits of personal data. Recently, contact-tracing apps were developed to collect data from individuals to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Because the success of these apps depends on widespread adoption and continuous data collection, we evaluate the effectiveness of monetary incentive mechanisms at promoting verified installations of the German Corona-Warn-App and short- and long-term data donations. We find monetary incentives are effective in the short term: They significantly increase app installations and short-term data donations, tripling the number of data donors after 14 days compared to no compensation. However, the positive stimulus of monetary incentives vanishes in the long term: After eight months, installers in treatments with monetary incentives are significantly more likely to have stopped donating data than intrinsically motivated installers who did not receive monetary incentives, as a consequence of experienced opportunity costs and a lack of perceived benefits. Consequently, long-term data donation rates are not significantly higher in treatments with monetary incentives. This suggests one-time payments are ineffective at promoting long-term data donations, as the short-term crowding-in of less intrinsically motivated installers is difficult to sustain when passive app usage limits opportunities for habit formation and convincing users of contact-tracing benefits.</content>

    <title>To Split or to Merge? How Partitioning Affects Consumption and Engagement with Digital Content</title>
    <updated>2025-06-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study reveals how partitioning serialized e-books into many short episodes (small partitioning (SP)) or fewer but lengthier segments (large partitioning (LP)) shapes reading behavior and economic outcomes. Using actual consumption data, we find that SP fosters higher total word consumption but can reduce overall progression through a title. Conversely, LP boosts completion rates, encourages deeper engagement through annotations and reviews, and spurs subsequent purchases. These positive effects are stronger when a book is popular or high in quality. Our results challenge the conventional view that shorter episodes automatically increase user attention, highlighting the need for a tailored approach. Stakeholders can implement LP for well-regarded or lengthy titles to maximize reader satisfaction and stimulate both reviews and further sales. Smaller partitions, however, might be beneficial for shorter works under a pay-per-word scheme or for certain audience preferences. By aligning partitioning strategies with content characteristics, publishers and platform owners can maintain robust consumer engagement, manage possible drawbacks of segmentation, and support sustainable growth. This research provides clear, actionable insights for digital publishing professionals seeking to optimize user experiences and drive profitability. These findings also encourage further inquiry into how partitioning strategies interact with rapidly evolving consumer preferences and reading technologies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Short-form video platforms such as TikTok and Douyin are widely used but have sparked serious concerns about their impact on youth mental health, especially suicidal thoughts. This study introduces a novel knowledge-guided neural topic model that predicts a video’s potential to induce suicidal thoughts in viewers at the time of upload. Unlike existing models, our approach integrates medical knowledge on suicide risk factors with user-generated content to improve prediction accuracy and explainability. Tested on real-world data from two major platforms, the model not only outperforms current machine learning and deep learning benchmarks but also uncovers emerging content themes linked to suicidal thought risk. For practice, this tool can be directly integrated into platforms’ content moderation pipelines, identifying high-risk videos for follow-up human review before harm spreads. For policy, it offers a scalable and ethically informed method to mitigate digital risks to youth mental health, balancing user safety with content creator rights. This work offers a critical step forward in responsible AI and public mental health protection in the era of algorithm-driven media.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides evidence that the U.S. dollar affects trade through a financial channel of the exchange rate. Using global data over three decades, we show that dollar appreciation increases import prices and decreases import quantities for non-U.S. dollar countries. In line with a financial channel, these effects are stronger when the exporting country borrows more in U.S. dollars abroad. The financial channel was active before the global financial crisis, has strengthened since, and operates independently of the dominant currency invoicing channel. Instrumenting the dollar is key to uncovering the full effect of the financial channel.</content>

    <title>Good Dispersion, Bad Dispersion</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that most dispersion in marginal revenue products of inputs occurs across plants within firms rather than between firms. This is commonly thought to reflect misallocation: dispersion is “bad”. However, we show that eliminating frictions hampering internal capital markets in a multi-plant firm model may in fact increase productivity dispersion and raise output: dispersion can be “good”. This arises as firms optimally stagger investment activity across their plants over time to avoid raising costly external finance, instead relying on reallocating internal funds. The staggering in turn generates dispersion in marginal revenue products. We use U.S. Census data on multi-plant manufacturing firms to provide empirical evidence for the model mechanism and show a quantitatively important role for good dispersion. Since there is less scope for good dispersion in emerging economies, the difference in the degree of misallocation between emerging and developed economies looks more pronounced than previously thought.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When inferring causal effects from correlational data, a common practice by professional researchers but also lay people is to control for potential confounders. Inappropriate controls produce erroneous causal inferences. I model decision-makers (DMs) who use endogenous observational data to learn actions’ causal effect on payoff-relevant outcomes. Different DM types use different controls. Their resulting choices affect the very correlations they learn from, thus calling for an equilibrium analysis of the steady-state welfare cost of bad controls. I obtain tight upper bounds on this cost. Equilibrium forces drastically reduce it when types’ sets of controls contain one another.</content>

    <title>The Asymmetric Effects of Posting an Online Review on Future Spending and the Dark Side of Solicitations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the prevalence of online review creation and solicitation, this paper examines whether posting an online review impacts the reviewer’s future spending on the reviewed brand. Identifying the causal effects of posting an online review is challenging because reviewers self-select into posting, making it an endogenous decision. I overcome this challenge by using randomized online review solicitations as an instrument for the endogenous treatment variable of posting an online review and establish that doing so decreases the average future spending by the reviewers on the reviewed brand. Additionally, I show that soliciting customers to post increases their propensity to write a review and thus in turn reduces their average future spending on the solicited brand. From a managerial standpoint, this finding suggests that online review solicitations can backfire, decreasing the average future spending by solicited customers. I therefore investigate whether the impact of posting (and hence soliciting) is heterogeneous with respect to customer satisfaction and loyalty. At the highest satisfaction level, posting does not change future spending regardless of customer loyalty. However, posting has a detrimental impact on future spending by dissatisfied reviewers. These adverse effects of posting emerge in the most loyal customers as soon as their satisfaction deviates from a perfect score (despite writing a positive review) and carry over to their future spending, even on nonreviewed brands of the company. Based on my findings, I present a set of guidelines for managers to follow when soliciting online reviews and responding to reviewers.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1 grant [Grant C207MSS20B006].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01951 .</content>

    <title>Search or Scroll: How Credibility Versus Likability Premiums Shape Consumer Following Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers’ choices of whom to follow on digital platforms shape their informational landscape. In an era where the credibility of informational sources is critical, this research examines two key questions: (1) When do consumers prioritize communicator credibility over likability in their decisions to follow? and (2) How do multiple credibility and likability cues interact to influence these decisions? Analyzing four large datasets from popular following-enabled platforms, we find consumers’ orientation towards content consumption—goal-directed (“search”) versus experiential (“scroll”)—is key. Communicator credibility drives following on search-driven platforms (Yelp, Goodreads), while likability drives following on scroll-driven ones (Twitter/X, Instagram). Aggregate communicator sentiment across multiple posts serves as a cross-platform indicator of credibility and likability, and its effect on follower-count differs by platform type. On scroll-driven platforms, communicators with positive aggregate sentiment benefit from a likeability premium, attracting the most followers; this preference for positivity is mitigated by the presence of alternative communicator likeability cues (e.g., using sociable language). On search-driven platforms, communicators with mixed aggregate sentiment benefit from a credibility premium, attracting the most followers; this preference for mixed sentiment is mitigated in the presence of alternative credibility cues (e.g., Yelp’s “Elite” badge). Implications for consumer protection and platform design are discussed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As electric vehicles (EVs) become more widespread, cities face the growing challenge of managing charging demand without overloading the grid. This study presents a novel information systems (IS) solution that supports smart and sustainable EV integration. The authors develop a capacity-based pricing model that adjusts in real time based on charging rates and grid capacity. Unlike many existing approaches, it avoids “avalanche effects” where synchronized charging behavior creates new demand peaks. The presented solution is also computationally efficient, making it practical for real-world use. Evaluated through simulations based on realistic urban scenarios, the model reduces demand volatility, aligns EV charging with renewable energy availability, and maintains overall charging costs for users. This work offers policy makers and energy providers a concrete tool to balance environmental goals with energy system reliability. For urban mobility planners, it provides a scalable, adaptive method to support the transition to cleaner urban mobility.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most research on family demands has been conducted at the individual level, showing that they can negatively influence employees' abilities to manage the work‐family interface. We challenge this existing paradigm by arguing that at the team level, family demands diversity (i.e., differences among members of the same team with respect to their family demands) can enable the entire team to better manage the work‐family interface. Drawing on the categorization‐elaboration model and social exchange theory, we found that family demands diversity was indirectly and positively related to team effort through team backup behavior and team work‐to‐family conflict, and these effects were stronger when team family identity was low and supervisor family support was high. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings and the practical implications for HR policies and practices.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Advance Multi-Priority, Multi-Appointment Patient Scheduling with Dependent Demand and Lead Times</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines a patient scheduling problem with multiple appointment types and priority levels, where certain appointments must precede others and lead times play a crucial role. Although both factors significantly influence the quality of care—particularly when specialist assessments depend on timely diagnostic tests—they have been largely overlooked in existing healthcare scheduling models. To address this gap, we propose a dynamic scheduling model that explicitly incorporates appointment dependencies, lead times, and patient heterogeneity across multiple priority levels. The model reflects the real-world complexities of coordinating diagnostic and consult appointments in time-sensitive clinical settings. Using Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) techniques, we develop an Approximate Optimal Policy (AOP) that efficiently allocates clinical resources, minimizes patient wait times, and ensures the availability of test results prior to consult appointments.We further derive a closed-form solution for the optimal approximation parameters, supported by a mathematical proof, which offers significant computational advantages. We evaluate the performance of the proposed AOP through simulation and compare it against a set of benchmark policies, including heuristics adapted from existing scheduling logic and current clinical practice. The solution is applied to a case study created based on data from a Stroke Prevention Clinic (SPC), where the complexity of care protocols and high demand present substantial scheduling challenges. The results demonstrate that the AOP consistently outperforms all benchmarks in terms of reducing wait times, ensuring timely diagnostic completion before consults, and meeting wait-time targets. We also introduce a practical, easy-to-implement heuristic called (MSP), which is derived from the AOP and designed for operational use. While simpler in structure, MSP performs comparably well and is well-suited for adoption in real healthcare settings due to its interpretability and minimal computational requirements. Finally, although the proposed approach is demonstrated in the context of an SPC, it has broader applicability to other areas such as cancer care, kidney transplant scheduling, and other complex care pathways involving interdependent appointments and prioritization.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Improving the Spatial Fairness of Spatiotemporal Sequence Forecasting Service Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Spatial unfairness in spatiotemporal forecasting tasks can lead to critical issues, e.g., inefficient resource allocation during pandemics or air pollution crises, exacerbating the spread of diseases or increasing exposure to pollution. The existing fair forecasting methods often struggle with spatiotemporal data that lack clear sensitive attributes and exhibit dynamic complexity. A pseudogrouping adversarial machine learning method that combines a spatiotemporal clustering-based pseudogrouping generator with an auxiliary classifier-based adversarial learning framework is proposed in this paper. The proposed pseudogrouping strategy identifies and labels hidden sensitive attributes, enabling fair forecasting models to effectively handle explicit sensitive attributes. Moreover, the existing adversarial learning methods are enhanced in this paper to accommodate the complex dynamics between the features and sensitive attributes contained in the input data. The proposed model is evaluated on three real-world datasets (pandemic, PM2.5, and traffic flow data) and is benchmarked against five existing models using three fairness metrics and three accuracy metrics. The experimental results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing fairness-focused models in terms of accuracy while maintaining fairness, and it markedly improves upon the fairness of accuracy-focused models without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, we examine the impact of a fairer forecasting model on the resource allocation process conducted during a pandemic by employing two types of fair resource allocation models. The numerical results derived from the mean–deviation tradeoff model show that using the forecasts obtained from our model can enhance both the efficiency and fairness of allocations when fairness is prioritized during decision-making. When efficiency is prioritized, the forecasting procedure of the proposed model yields improved allocation efficiency, albeit at the cost of reduced fairness. Additionally, results obtained from the α-fairness model indicate that the proposed fair forecasting model consistently outperforms the benchmark across diverse resource allocation objectives, especially when prioritizing one of fairness or efficiency. The findings of this study provide crucial insights into the fairness of forecasting algorithms, illustrating how the introduction of a pseudogrouping strategy and an enhanced adversarial learning framework can significantly improve the fairness of predictive algorithms.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Value of Flexibility in Robust Supply Chain Network Design</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A supply chain network design problem (SCNDP) involves making long-term, irreversible strategic decisions whose cost efficiency depends on effectively leveraging flexibility and demand information. After analyzing the interaction of these factors, we propose five distinct policies for addressing the SCNDP. Starting with a localized production model where demand is satisfied locally, the study extends to scenarios where production capacity at one location serves other nodes (Policy II). Further flexibility is introduced by enabling capacity sharing among facilities with prearranged links (Policy III). Unlike these policies, which optimize capacities as proxies for production decisions prior to demand realization, Policies IV and V defer production decisions until demand is realized. The robustness and resilience of these policies are evaluated under varying levels of demand uncertainty and risks of supply disruptions. To provide actionable insights, we develop robust two-stage optimization frameworks for the proposed policies and design efficient methods to address varying uncertainty budgets for both supply and demand risks. Our results reveal that under demand uncertainty alone: (i) Capacity-sharing links among facilities yield the highest cost savings across all uncertainty budgets due to the pooling effect and significantly reduce shortage probability (Policy III), and (ii) Production postponement offers only marginal benefits, highlighting the greater importance of upstream capacity-sharing over postponing production, particularly for moderate uncertainty budgets. Under simultaneous demand and supply risks, we demonstrate that (iii) capacity-sharing retains its value, while flexibility from production postponement deteriorates performance, favoring partially flexible networks with only capacity-sharing links over fully flexible ones with both sources of flexibility. To contextualize these findings, we apply the most effective policies to a real-world case study, quantifying their impact and providing design recommendations. Finally, we extend our models to an event-wise ambiguity set and demonstrate that by (iv) leveraging the supermodular structure of the second-stage problems, one can solve instances up to eight times larger.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Driven by climate change and overuse, water stress is a worsening sustainability concern that threatens businesses and communities across the globe. Leading global organizations such as the United Nations have expressed an urgent need for sustainable water management strategies across nations and economies. Yet, the field of supply chain management does not have a substantial research stream related to water. A key challenge is the lack of a persuasive organizing framework within this setting. This study presents a systematic literature review of water stress from a supply chain perspective. Literature spanning over two decades across an array of journals is synthesized into an overarching framework that organizes topics related to water. Challenges firms face due to operational and contextual water risks are presented. Based on the proposed framework, research gaps for further exploration of the relationship between supply chains and water stress are suggested.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the last decade and recently, a wide range of industries and organizations have been subject to IT-related security threats and cybersecurity breaches of varying degrees of severity at an alarming rate. A common practice adopted by organizations to ensure system and network security is to conduct regular audits and assessments. This paper takes on an organizational strategy perspective to analytically model the cost impact of random breaches in various types of networks subject to different types of audit policy. The analysis focuses on the interplay between the cost associated with a security breach on the one hand, and audit policy on the other. We develop a model for a non-stationary stochastic arrival process of security breaches and analyze the impact on mean and variance of total cost of different network configurations and audit policies. The generality of our modeling of the arrival process and the cost function permits a variety of attack and cost landscapes to be modeled and analyzed, with different breach intensities and costs (as functions of time) leading to different recommendations in terms of effective audit policy. Our analysis highlights the impact of intensity of security breach and cost of breach on the interaction between different network configurations and audit policies. One of our counter-intuitive findings is that under high security threat conditions a centralized network has a lower mean as well as a lower variance of total cost than a decentralized network, in case of cyclic and random audits; this analytically derived proposition is an interesting instance of adual risk-pooling effectthat goes beyond conventional risk-pooling. We extend our analysis to consider an asymmetric network and correlated breaches.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Online Venting: the Impact of Temporal Proximity Cues and Emotionality on Perceptions of Negative Online Review Value</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Because negative reviews have the potential to dissuade consumers, brands necessarily worry about them. Prior literature generally supports the notion that negative information offers greater value to and influences consumers more powerfully, yet in specific circumstances, negative online reviews might be less helpful and influential. As the current research establishes, when negative reviews exhibit near (vs. far) temporal proximity cues, relative to a reviewed experience with a product or service,andsome degree of negative emotionality, consumers tend to discount them in their decision-making. Such outcomes seemingly arise because consumers identify a negative review that combines near temporal proximity (i.e., posted or written in a way that makes the experience feel temporally close) with negative emotionality as a form of “venting.” They then ascribe the information in the negative review to reviewer-related rather than to relevant product or service quality attributes. Consistent evidence for this venting discount effect emerges from analyses of actual hotel reviews from TripAdvisor, as well as multiple experimental studies, involving both products and services.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Using Expenditure Reframes to Increase Interest in Claiming Government Benefits</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Millions of eligible lower-income people do not apply for government benefits. Increasing interest in applying for these benefits is a crucial concern for marketers and economists, as the underutilization of benefits limits their effectiveness. This research proposes thatexpenditure reframes, descriptions translating monetary amounts into expense categories, can increase interest in government benefits. Expenditure reframes enhance a benefit’s psychological value, helping consumers better understand its impact on their financial lives. Evidence from a large-scale preregistered field experiment (N= 14,267) aimed at encouraging lower-income individuals to claim a tax credit demonstrates that expenditure reframe messages increased interest, increasing visits to the claiming website. A second preregistered large-scale field experiment among Medicaid recipients (N= 71,939) identifies a boundary condition for the effect of expenditure reframes on interest. A third preregistered large-scale field experiment replicates the efficacy of expenditure reframes (N= 36,081) and highlights how the expense type featured in the reframe moderates these effects. Results from three preregistered online experiments support these findings and further elucidate the impact of expenditure reframes on psychological value. This work underscores how marketers, practitioners, and policymakers shape perceptions of government benefits and illustrates key considerations for designing effective outreach campaigns targeting lower-income households.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: A Meta-Analysis of Product Visual Aesthetics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite firms’ emphasis on product visual aesthetics (PVA) for competitive advantage, questions remain regarding which aesthetic properties enhance PVA the most, the strength of PVA’s effect on consumer responses, and moderating factors. To address these gaps, the authors conduct a meta-analysis of 727 effect sizes from 263 independent samples spanning 1993-2024. Findings reveal that both organizational and meaningful aesthetic properties positively impact PVA, with harmony being the strongest property. PVA positively influences both consumer attitudes and behaviors. The authors develop a comprehensive framework of moderators across five key groups: brand, product, communication, consumer, and environmental factors. The moderator analyses yield multiple important insights and (1) identify economic growth and consumption publicity as particularly influential; (2) recognize previously unexplored but relevant moderators (e.g., aesthetic object type, individualism, and income inequality); (3) clarify debated moderators (e.g., brand familiarity, product quality level, and gender); (4) reveal that certain moderator combinations can turn PVA effects negative. For instance, focusing on packaging aesthetics with utilitarian, private, non-durable, and low-quality products can turn the effect of PVA on attitudes negative; and (5) find an attitude-behavior gap in the moderating effects of PVA. The study provides new insights into the nuanced effects of PVA for effective application.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to transform how brands communicate with consumers. Recent research demonstrates AI’s benefits in producing text, but marketing research has not yet explored how marketers can leverage AI to create visual advertising. Despite their impressive capabilities, “off the shelf” generative AI models are not aligned with marketing objectives, raising the question whether fine-tuning generative AI directly on conventional advertising objectives like evoking attention or driving interest is possible. In this research, we train an open-source generative AI model on marketing mindset metrics and show that the resulting visual content can match and even exceed conventionally produced advertising content in associated performance metrics. We also demonstrate that generative AI can be fine-tuned on multiple communication objectives simultaneously and adapted to specific audiences. In addition to highlighting generative AI’s potential in marketing, we probe the limitations of aligning visual generative AI with marketing objectives.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Through an abductive qualitative case study of a Colombian peacebuilding NGO, we explore how social intermediaries facilitate the integration of fragmented ex‐combatant and campesino communities. Our analysis reveals a three‐stage process by which the social intermediary simultaneously engages in enterprise‐focused and community‐focused activities to transform loosely connected ‘communities of circumstance’ into tightly integrated ‘communities of choice’. First, the intermediary uses ‘dirty boots’ to establish itself as a trusted,shared relationshipbetween communities. It then employs an ‘accompaniment’ approach to cultivateshared spaces,shared practices, andshared interestsamong community members engaging in collective entrepreneurial activities. Finally, it shifts to ‘distant friends’ as it encourages communities to embrace ashared futuretogether. By clarifying how intermediaries can use entrepreneurship as a force for community integration, particularly within necessity contexts of conflict and poverty, we contribute to research on social intermediaries, communities, and entrepreneurship as a tool to address grand challenges.</content>

    <title>AI Companions Reduce Loneliness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Chatbots are now able to engage in sophisticated conversations with consumers in the domain of relationships, providing a potential coping solution to widescale societal loneliness. Behavioral research provides little insight into whether these applications are effective at alleviating loneliness. We address this question by focusing on “AI companions”: applications designed to provide consumers with synthetic interaction partners. Study 1 examines user reviews of AI companion apps and finds correlational evidence suggesting that these apps help alleviate loneliness. Study 2 finds that AI companions successfully alleviate loneliness on par only with interacting with another person, and more than other activities such as watching YouTube videos. Moreover, consumers underestimate the degree to which AI companions improve their loneliness. Study 3 uses a longitudinal design and finds that an AI companion consistently provides momentary reductions in loneliness after use over the course of a week. Study 4 provides evidence that both the chatbots’ performance and, especially, whether it makes users feel heard, explain reductions in loneliness. Study 5 provides an additional robustness check for the loneliness-alleviating benefits of AI companions and shows that self-disclosure and distraction alone do not explain AI companions’ effectiveness.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct an experiment to investigate the use of peer evaluations for compensation purposes. Although organizations often rely on peer evaluations for incentive compensation, it is not well understood how peer feedback should be used and designed to ensure non‐distorted evaluations and motivate effort provision. We study peer evaluations in form of bonus allocation proposals, thereby enabling a quantifiable test of our hypothesis. We distinguish between discretionary use (i.e., allocation by the manager) and formulaic use (i.e., allocation by the team via the average) of self‐including and self‐excluding proposals. We find that, relative to self‐including proposals, self‐excluding proposals are less distorted, irrespective of use, but lead to more effort provision only under formulaic use. Under discretionary use, the benefits of self‐excluding proposals are offset, as managerial biases enter bonus allocations. In sum, our findings illustrate benefits of delegating bonus allocations to teams through formulaic use of self‐excluding peer evaluations and extend the understanding of how organizations can effectively incorporate peer evaluations into incentive compensation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine firms' trade‐offs in their voluntary disclosure decisions following negative media coverage of climate change incidents. By combining a keyword discovery algorithm and a fine‐tuned BERT model, we identify “hard” and “soft” climate disclosures on Twitter. Our findings indicate that firms tend to issue climate tweets as a rapid response to negative climate incidents. Additionally, firms with a history of hard climate change disclosure, as measured by ESG reports, are more likely to issue climate‐related responses than firms without such a history. Furthermore, we show that prior hard disclosure is associated with hard responses when the incident receives moderate media attention, but with soft responses when the incident receives low media attention. Our findings provide empirical insights for dynamic disclosure theory by illustrating how prior disclosure shapes firms' response strategies to negative media coverage.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Network agency matters in entrepreneurship. As purposeful agents, entrepreneurs actively interact with their surroundings. However, scholars only have limited and dispersed knowledge about the antecedents, mechanisms, and outcomes of entrepreneurs’ network agency. We performed an integrative review of network agency in entrepreneurship to provide a much-needed synthesis of the fragmented insights into this topic. By moving away from a deterministic approach in which social structures shape entrepreneurs’ destinies and toward an agentic approach in which social networks shape entrepreneurs while simultaneously being shaped, managed, and developed by them, we contribute to a refined understanding of social networks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite growing interest in serendipity in entrepreneurship, its antecedents, contingencies, and outcomes remain understudied. We find that new firms with a monochronic orientation—a preference for handling tasks sequentially—experience more serendipity, which in turn enhances innovation performance. This is amplified in dynamic environments, where unexpected discoveries are more likely to generate value. Challenging assumptions that systematic search and broad information inputs drive innovation, our study highlights focused attention as a driver of serendipity. By linking serendipity to strategic attention allocation and environmental conditions, we offer insights into how firms can foster and capitalize on unexpected discoveries to drive innovation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurial experimentation is the process by which entrepreneurs design, conduct, and interpret tests of cause-and-effect relationships in order to learn and reduce uncertainty, risk, and doubt associated with new venture development. Research suggests entrepreneurial experimentation is essential to the entrepreneurial journey. Yet, this research remains fragmented, resulting in conceptual ambiguity. In this article, we review and synthesize the scholarly literature on entrepreneurial experimentation from 1985 to 2024. In so doing, we synthesize this literature into a definition, conceptual foundations, and an integrative theoretical framework. We conclude with a future research agenda that explores more nuance, contingencies, and sociocultural dynamics.</content>

    <title>The Distribution of Investor Beliefs, Stock Ownership, and Stock Returns</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the relationship between the distribution of investor beliefs, the breadth of ownership, and expected returns in a model where stocks differ in the intensity of disagreement and in the extent to which beliefs are polarized, as measured by the number of optimists and pessimists relative to moderates. Polarization explains the size-dependent relationship between breadth and expected returns that we find empirically: positive for large stocks and negative for small stocks. We also find empirical support for the underlying mechanism: polarized stocks earn lower expected returns and are held more broadly if small and less broadly if large.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the Comunidad de Madrid [Programa Excelencia para el Profesorado Universitario, Convenio con Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, V Plan Regional de Investigacion Cientifica e Innovacion Tecnologica], the LSE Paul Woolley Centre, and the Spanish National Research Council [Grant PID2019-111358GB-I00].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02027 .</content>

    <title>Better Than Myself: A Translation and Extension of Internal Comparison Theories in Management</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social comparison theory (SCT) is ubiquitous and underlies much of modern management research. However, in addition to comparing ourselves externally to similar others, educational and social psychologists study how internal comparisons affect children. Internal comparison theories (ICTs) fall into two categories that include (a) temporal comparisons, that is, comparisons between our current self-evaluation and a past or future evaluation; and (b) dimensional comparisons, that is, comparisons between our evaluation in one dimension (e.g., teaching skills) to our evaluation on another dimension (e.g., research skills). We compare tenets of ICTs and SCT and present novel theoretical propositions around these tenets, and show how they differentially impact affective, behavioral, and cognitive identity work. Additionally, we offer future directions for how theorizing could be expanded on core internal comparison theories, as well as how ICTs could be used as a theoretical framework for research on identity, stress and well-being, justice, leadership, emotions, and social hierarchy.</content>

    <title>Comparing Learning-by-Doing Between In-House Provision and External Contracting in Public Service Provision</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Studies of organizational learning show that experience enables firms to utilize specific governance structures effectively. Nevertheless, little attention has been given to comparing the effects of learning-by-doing across different structures. In this paper we investigate whether the duration of operation influences performance differently in two structures utilized in public services: in-house provision and external contracting. An analysis of water supply data in France from 1998 to 2008 suggests that the learning advantages are greater in external contracting due to its high-powered incentives, but these benefits decrease as the technological complexity and environmental uncertainty of public services increase. We contribute to organizational learning theory, extend research on governance structures, and provide critical insights into the sustainable management of natural resources.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a specific practice of predatory lending: Borrowers being rejected and approved in rapid succession by the same lender. We show that in such cases borrower and contract characteristics and ex post performance are consistent with predatory steering. Steered borrowers are associated with groups with lower financial sophistication. They are more likely to enter non-amortizing contracts with high profit margins that are quickly securitized. Steered borrowers default less in boom years when refinancing is easy. However, their performance deteriorates sharply once falling prices trap them in contracts with rising payments, reflecting the long-term costs of predatory lending.</content>

    <title>The Interdependence Between Donors and Investors: Liability of Hybridity, Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Affordances, and Venture Financing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how spatial and digital affordances within entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs) enable early-stage hybrid ventures to overcome the liability of hybridity and to secure funding from both philanthropic and equity funding sources. Using a simultaneous equation model with a U.S.-based sample of 2,723 hybrid ventures, we demonstrate that philanthropic and equity funding exhibit a statistically and economically significant complementary relationship. We further find that accelerator participation weakens this complementary relationship, while social media utilization strengthens it. These findings highlight the mechanisms through which EE-based affordances enhance hybrid ventures’ ability to navigate competing institutional logics and attract diverse funding sources.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Root metaphors shape and reflect thinking in a field of research. This article analyzes how root metaphors from management studies are used in mainstream entrepreneurship research. We show how some root metaphors have been adapted, particularly those with negative connotations. We use the adapted metaphors to identify blind spots, suggest areas of research largely overlooked, and provide alternative perspectives on familiar phenomena in mainstream entrepreneurship research. We identify a positive root metaphor—organizations as instruments of emancipation—and discuss how it contributes to the canon of root metaphors for organizations, hitherto characterized as neutral or negative.</content>

    <title>Art for Whose Sake? Managing Professional Autonomy and Empowered Clients in the Porcelain Capital of China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing research suggests that experts often protect their professional autonomy by rejecting lay clients’ feedback or passing it to intermediaries (e.g., managers and agents). However, the rise of review platforms and disintermediated marketplaces has empowered clients to publicly share challenging feedback, and experts’ defensive tactics may further erode public trust in their services. In contrast, our qualitative study of 67 porcelain artists in China reveals that experts can effectively translate clients’ feedback to preserve their professional autonomy. These artistsdecomposedanddistilledtheir expertise—differentiating the essential, identity-defining aspects from the more-peripheral, expendable ones—allowing them to incorporate clients’ feedback into the latter aspects while retaining control over the former ones. This strategy enabled the artists to integrate client-driven creations into their professional identity as artistic experts, thereby preserving their professional autonomy. Notably, not all artists adopted this strategy. Those who considered their work as an indivisible whole were financially compelled to bend to clients’ demands, or they chose to exit the profession. These findings present a paradoxical view of professional autonomy, suggesting that experts can maintain their professional freedom by granting clients limited and selective influence, thereby fostering clients’ compliance and public recognition in an era of increasing influence by lay audiences.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines whether more bank presence in underserved areas can improve house- holds’ health. Leveraging a 2005 Reserve Bank of India policy and a regression discon- tinuity design, I demonstrate that five years post-policy, treatment districts have 27 more bank branches than control districts. This expansion increases household employment and access to savings accounts, enhancing health investments. On the healthcare supply side, hospitals utilize more credit and expand services. Six years after the policy, households in treatment districts are 19 percentage points less likely to suffer from non-chronic illnesses in a given month. Chronic diseases remain unaffected.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how collaborator loss affects the individual productivity of knowledge workers in corporate research and development (R&amp;D). Specifically, we argue that the effect of such loss depends on whether the lost collaborator was internal or external to the organization, which may have compensatory measures in place to maintain the continuity of R&amp;D efforts. To empirically investigate the effect of internal and external collaborator loss, we leverage 845 unexpected deaths of active inventors. We find a substantial negative effect on inventive productivity for the loss of external collaborators, particularly when the collaborator was of presumably high relevance to the remaining inventor. In contrast, the effect for the loss of internal collaborators is virtually zero. We show that the organization’s knowledge management and hiring capabilities are instrumental in explaining the muted effect of internal collaborator loss.This paper was accepted by Toby Stuart, innovation &amp; entrepreneurship.Funding: This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Grant 329144242 and Collaborative Research Center TRR 190] and the Agencia Estatal de Investigacion [Grants CEX2019-000915-S and RYC2022-038012-I].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03045 .</content>

    <title>Institutional Logics as a Resource and Risk: Logic Deviance and Categorical Penalties in US Community Banks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can institutional logics be damaging for the same category of actors they are presumed to benefit? Can firms prevent or reduce this detrimental effect? This study integrates the institutional logics perspective with category research to examine these questions in the context of community banks. Community banks are locally embedded firms explicitly adhering to the community logic – a worldview that emphasizes the values of mutual trust and reciprocity. While previous research suggests that the community logic can benefit the financial performance of locally embedded firms, we propose that it can also impose risks, depending on the circumstances. Specifically, we predict that a stronger community logic not only benefits the financial performance of locally embedded firms, but also increases categorical penalties (i.e., delegitimation and stigma), damaging the financial performance of non‐culpable firms when other community firms commit wrongdoing. We also predict that firms can diminish categorical penalties through community investment. Examining the financial performance of the full sample of US community banks in 352 communities for the years 2006–2013, we find robust empirical support for these predictions.</content>

    <title>The Scale Orientation Effect: How the Spatial and Magnitude Orientation of Scales Shapes Survey Responses</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Technology makes it possible for researchers and practitioners to change the orientation of scales. Scales can be oriented horizontally from left-to-right with values increasing (0 left-10 right) or decreasing (10 left-0 right), or vertically from top-to-bottom with values increasing (0 top-10 bottom) or decreasing (10 top-0 bottom). Does the congruence of a scale’s spatial orientation (whether it is horizontal versus vertical) and magnitude orientation (the direction in which values increase) influence survey responses? Seven preregistered experiments (N=6002) and four preregistered supplemental experiments (N = 5674) examine the effect of a scale’s spatial-magnitude congruence on Net Promoter Scores (NPS). The results show that scales with incongruent spatial-magnitude orientations result in lower NPS ratings than those with congruent ones. We propose that horizontal and vertical spatial orientations are associated with a specific magnitude orientation in the mind. Horizontal scales feel more intuitive with increasing (0 left-10 right) versus decreasing (10 left-0 right) magnitude. Vertical scales feel more intuitive with decreasing (10 top-0 bottom) versus increasing (0 top-10 bottom) magnitudes. Researchers and managers designing surveys to measure consequential constructs such as NPS should not change the spatial-magnitude orientation of their scales across companies, survey platforms, or time—such changes can render their data less comparable.</content>

    <title>The “Confidence” Trap: When the Likelihood Is Low, Forecasters Look Less Competent When They Refer to Their Confidence in an Outcome Rather than Its Probability</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Marketers make various forecasts, including those about new products, financial instruments, sporting events, and medical procedures, to influence consumer decisions. In communicating the likelihood that a forecaster assigns to an outcome, the forecaster can refer to their confidence in the outcome (e.g., “I’m 30% confident”) or the probability of the outcome (e.g., “There is a 30% probability”). We propose that the choice of language (e.g., probability vs. confidence) affects the perceptions of forecasters, yielding predictable consequences on consumer decisions. Specifically, we argue that some languages (e.g., confident/sure/certain) encourage internal attributions (e.g., to a forecaster), whereas other languages (e.g., probability/likelihood/chance) encourage external attributions (e.g., to an outcome). As a result, expressions of a forecaster’s confidence (vs. outcome probability) make the forecaster look less competent, especially when the likelihood of the outcome is low. A series of studies shows the effect in various consumption scenarios. We further show that the effect is mediated by internal (vs. external) attributions, influences real betting decisions, and is mitigated when the likelihood is high and among consumers with a weaker tendency to make internal attributions (ie, a weaker correspondence bias).</content>

    <title>Silence Inside Systems: Roots and Generativity Consequences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Modern information technology (IT) systems evolve less through visible coordination and more through subtle behavioral patterns—most notably, silence: the relative absence of interaction internally. We conceptualize silence as a dynamic system-wide behavior distinct from architecture. This quietness is a powerful design trait. Our study of nearly 1,400 systems over 25 years shows that when modules “talk” less, developers focus more, accelerating evolutionary innovation. Silent systems produce cleaner, more maintainable code and are 600 times more likely to be extended by others. This matters now more than ever. As systems grow larger and more entangled, brittleness has become a pressing problem; small tweaks routinely trigger large failures. Brute-force solutions, like scaling compute power, are reaching physical and economic limits. Silence is an architectural antidote; by reducing internal dependencies, it lets teams adapt swiftly, avoid technical debt spirals, and better steward artificial intelligence-driven and autonomous systems. For practitioners and policymakers, this paper urges a rethink of how we build and sustain IT systems. Rather than endlessly scaling resources to support chatty, tightly linked modules, designers should prioritize structural quietness. Silence is not just good hygiene; it is a lever for IT resilience, scalability, and generative innovation. Silence is golden; it is what sharpens attention, anchors stability, and unlocks generative possibility.</content>

    <title>Developing the Entrepreneurial Paradox Mindset: The Role of Startup Accelerators and Educational Programs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Startup founders often encounter paradoxical tensions. Yet, whether and how startup accelerators can equip founders to embrace such contradictions remains underexplored. Our study of Y Combinator reveals that accelerators can play a pivotal role in cultivating an entrepreneurial paradox mindset by exposing founders to teachings about paradoxical tensions, imparting heuristics to navigate them, and implementing thoughtful design choices to foster learning—particularly through vicarious and experiential learning opportunities. This study integrates paradox theory into entrepreneurship research, contributes to understanding the interplay between accelerator design choices and entrepreneurial learning, extends knowledge of entrepreneurial mindsets, and provides several practical insights.</content>

    <title>Human Capital Theory and Venture Capital Firms: Exploring “Home Runs” and “Strike Outs”—A Replication and Extension of Dimov and Shepherd (2005)</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The present work is a registered report1focused on a replication and extension of the findings in Dimov and Shepherd (2005). Our work tests the hypotheses from the original article in an expanded industry context and with an updated sample. The wider sample includes low- and medium-tech industries, and an expanded time frame as opposed to the original sample based on the high-tech wireless industry in a 5-year span. We used the same estimation technique (OLS regression) from the original article but also expand on it by using multivariate regression and seemingly unrelated regression to model multiple outcomes simultaneously as well as negative binomial analyses to accommodate the count nature of outcome variables—initial public offerings as home runs and bankruptcies as strike outs. We also model more fine-grained outcomes of venture capital (VC) investments (underpricing, 180-day return, market value). Our findings support the inference that general human capital has a significant effect on investment success measures. Furthermore, the findings align with predictions about the relation between general and specific human capital in reducing measures of investment failure. Our replication and extension efforts are crucial in advancing the literature with regard to four key points. First, we find that the types of human capital vary in their influence on VC-related outcomes. Second, by examining alternative measures of VC-related outcomes, we illustrate that the effect of human capital on VC outcomes varies depending on the measure of outcome. Third, our results suggest that the relation between human capital and VC-related outcomes varies by industry type and time to exit. Fourth, our reexamine of the findings from Dimov and Shepherd (2005) seems to illustrate support for hypotheses that were unsupported in the original study.</content>

    <title>No Credit for Success, Penalized for Failure? An Examination of Entrepreneur Race, Gender, and Prior Fundraising Track Records in Crowdfunding</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While Black entrepreneurs have historically received less startup funding than White entrepreneurs, the nuances of this relationship have been understudied. We employ role and intersectionality theory to fill this gap by examining how race and associated stereotypes of Black entrepreneurs influence the impact of entrepreneurs’ prior fundraising track record on current fundraising efforts. Using 1,164 hand-coded crowdfunding campaigns and a follow-on experiment, we find that Black entrepreneurs receive less credit for prior success, and are penalized more for prior failure, than White entrepreneurs. Gender moderates this relationship in that Black women see even less benefit from prior success and experience a larger decline in support after failure than Black men.</content>

    <title>Cooperation and punishment in managing social performance: Labor standards in the Gap Inc. supply chain</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Corporate social performance depends not only on a firm's behavior but also on the behavior of its suppliers. What management strategies improve the social performance of suppliers? Scholarship on inter‐firm relations and regulatory governance debates the efficacy of threatening to penalize suppliers, compared with more cooperative approaches. This study uses a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effects of typical actions to manage supplier social performance, both with and without threatened penalties. Suppliers improved social performance—increasing their probability of passing labor audits by 22 percentage points—only when regulatory actions included a threatened penalty: to discontinue business. Suppliers improved most in response to threatened penalties when they faced higher levels of supply chain competition or were engaged in longer‐term commercial relationships with the buyer.Managerial SummaryHow can multinationals improve labor standards in their suppliers around the world? We compared two approaches at the clothing retailer Gap Inc. When Gap did not threaten to discontinue business with low‐performing suppliers, we found no improvement in labor compliance when Gap issued failing compliance grades. However, once Gap began threatening to discontinue business with its lowest‐compliance suppliers, failing suppliers showed marked improvement in labor compliance. Failing suppliers improved most when (a) they faced high competition within their product category, and (b) when they were in longer‐term commercial relationships with the buyer. Our findings suggest buyers should use a combination of both threats and cooperation with suppliers to improve labor standards in global supply chains.</content>

    <title>From margins to mainstream: The narrative dilemma in scaling social ventures</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As social ventures expand beyond their original marginalized customers, they face demand‐side limitations to scale. This study examines how a common tool for managing strategic change – origin stories – affects non‐marginalized customers’ responses. In a survey‐based field experiment with an Indian feminine hygiene company that initially served rural customers but now targets urban customers, we found that telling origin stories reduced urban customers’ purchase intentions compared to not telling them. This result appears driven by stigma transfer: non‐marginalized customers avoided stigma by not purchasing products associated with stigmatized groups. However, when framed around social responsibility, the origin story increased non‐purchase support (e.g., joining the mailing list). Because it remains unclear whether the increased support is temporary or sustained, social ventures must weigh such gains against potential declines in purchases as they scale.Managerial summaryHow can social ventures expand beyond marginalized communities? A survey‐based field experiment with an Indian feminine hygiene company reveals that sharing its origin story with urban, non‐marginalized customers reduced purchase intentions. This response was likely due to stigma transfer, where urban customers avoided stigma by distancing themselves from products associated with rural users. However, framing the story around social responsibility increased mailing list subscriptions. An important takeaway for social ventures is that origin stories about marginalized customers may deter mainstream purchases. Since it remains unclear whether non‐purchase engagement reflects symbolic action or sustained interest, social ventures must weigh whether the potential gains meaningfully offset purchase losses when telling origin stories to new customers.</content>

    <title>Does U.S. Immigration Policy Facilitate Financial Misconduct?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether U.S. immigration policy, specifically the H‐1B visa program, affects the likelihood of financial misconduct. We argue that employers have leverage over employees on H‐1B visas because such employees must maintain H‐1B–eligible employment to legally reside in the United States. We posit that companies relying on H‐1B visas to hire workers in accounting roles have an increased ability to misreport their financial statements due to the greater costs H‐1B employees face if they are unexpectedly fired for not following the demands of their bosses or for blowing the whistle on misconduct. Using the sharp reduction in the H‐1B visa cap in 2004 as a shock to such employment, we find that companies that relied on this visa program for accounting roles pre‐shock experience a 2.3 percentage point decline in accounting irregularities post‐shock. Cross‐sectional tests show that the reduction in irregularities is greater in companies where H‐1B employees have (1) a greater influence on financial reporting or (2) fewer job opportunities. In addition, the relation between H‐1B visa use and irregularities is stronger in companies whose investors are more focused on near‐term earnings targets. We corroborate our findings using the outcome of H‐1B visa lotteries as shocks to such employment.</content>

    <title>Is Prior Failure a Burden for Entrepreneurs’ Follow-Up Crowdfunding Success?: An Expectancy Violations Theory Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Is prior failure a burden for entrepreneurs’ subsequent crowdfunding success? Prior research is equivocal with some suggesting failure offers a valuable learning experience, whereas others suggest failure indicates that entrepreneurs lack the competencies to be successful. To provide clarity, we draw on expectancy violations theory and delve into the influence of gender. We find that as the magnitude of failure increases, entrepreneurs’ likelihood of subsequent crowdfunding success decreases. However, this baseline relationship is moderated by the valence crowdfunders have toward entrepreneurs. We find that women entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs that failed in gender-incongruent categories are more likely to secure subsequent crowdfunding.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While Knightian uncertainty (KU) has been central to entrepreneurship research for over half a century, there remains a lack of consensus on how to define, apply, and learn from the concept. We argue that, despite the apparent fragmentation of views and theories, there has been significant and valuable knowledge accumulation around KU that can inform entrepreneurship research. Reviewing 238 articles published over the past 60 years across seven disciplines, we find that (1) there is considerable congruity in how KU is discussed within, but not across, disciplines and at micro, meso, and macro levels of analysis; (2) cross-fertilization and integration of interdisciplinary insights exist but are insufficiently explored by entrepreneurship researchers; (3) progress in understanding and analyzing uncertainty may come primarily from multi-level, interdisciplinary analysis; and (4) entrepreneurship researchers may benefit from engaging the definitions and theories of uncertainty from neighboring fields like economics and decision science. We suggest a variety of research questions to unite different disciplines across levels of analysis to create a more integrated research agenda for KU in entrepreneurship studies.</content>

    <title>Low profile, high impact: How the visibility of political agents shapes corporate political influence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how corporate political influence in developed democracies is more likely to occur where visibility is lower, both in terms of the actors involved and of the points of influence in allocation processes. Using novel data on politically exposed persons across 28 European countries (2011–2017), I distinguish between elected and unelected political agents in shaping public procurement outcomes. Unelected agents, particularly aides, advisors, and administrative staff, exert stronger influence than elected politicians, who primarily steer upstream processes that offer political cover in uncompetitive bidding situations. In contrast, unelected agents affect both competitive and uncompetitive cases, underscoring the role of political (in)visibility in public resource allocation. This study deepens our understanding of the heterogeneity of corporate political connections and their impact on public–private exchange.Managerial SummaryThis study examines how corporate political influence in developed democracies often operates through less visible channels. Using data on politically exposed persons across 28 European countries, I find that connections to unelected officials, such as aides and advisors, exert greater influence on firms' public procurement outcomes than connections to elected politicians. Elected politicians affect uncompetitive awards by possibly shaping the rules and specifications that restrict competition, rather than intervening during more transparent stages when bids are evaluated. In contrast, unelected officials influence a broader range of competitive and uncompetitive procurements, taking advantage of their lower visibility to engage across processes. These findings raise important implications for public oversight and for firms engaging with government.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a portfolio-independent method to estimate q-theory models, in which parameters are obtained using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to match firm-level stock returns. Our methodology addresses a previous critique on prior studies that model parameters are chosen to fit a specific set of anomalies and different values are needed to fit each anomaly. By targeting the entire sample of firm-level returns and allowing industry and time variations in parameter values, our estimations yield higher correlations between realized and fundamental portfolio returns compared with prior literature. Additionally, the estimated two-capital model generates large and significant size, momentum, profitability, investment, and intangibles premiums, but falls short in explaining the value and accruals anomalies. This limitation underscores the importance of portfolio-independent parameter estimation in evaluating a model’s capability to generate return anomalies.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: S.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use role congruity theory to examine how differing role expectations surrounding entrepreneur gender and race shape the influence of social responsibility rhetoric used in crowdfunding pitches. To do so, we develop a novel content‐analytic measure of social responsibility rhetoric using the Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini (KLD) dimensions of social responsibility. Results indicate an inverted U‐shaped relationship between social responsibility rhetoric and funding. Campaigns created by men, particularly men of colour, experience larger performance gains from using such rhetoric than campaigns created by women, but have greater declines in performance at higher levels of such rhetoric. As such, our work extends recent findings regarding the potential ‘dark side’ of social responsibility by showing that the mere use of language related to social responsibility may have negative consequences. We also expand work in entrepreneurship concerning how gender and racial dynamics influence funding outcomes for entrepreneurs, while providing the first content‐analytic measure of social responsibility that is theoretically grounded in the widely used KLD conceptualization of social responsibility prominent in management and entrepreneurship research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What role do innovators play in the evolution of product categories? While management scholars have documented multiple cases of innovators creating new product categories, less attention has been paid to how innovators reshape existing ones. This paper explores the possibility that innovators can change the boundaries of established categories to accommodate their products. In an historical case study of the acceptance of mortgage‐backed securities (MBS) as bonds in the United States between 1970 and 1995, I find that MBS issuers succeeded in fitting their products into the bond category by introducing a new dimension to the category.Managerial SummaryThis study expands our understanding of category evolution by showing that innovators can reshape the boundaries of existing product categories to accommodate new offerings. Specifically, it finds that innovators succeeded in modifying a prototype‐based category by positioning their product as a substitute—a goal‐based category. Redefining category boundaries allowed the innovators to secure membership for their products without needing to create a new category or fully redesign the product. This research highlights the agentic role of innovators in the evolution of categories, the interaction between goal‐based and prototype‐based categories in innovation diffusion, and the importance of commensuration for achieving product‐category fit.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Seeking Alpha (SA) is the most popular crowdsourced social media platform specializing in the financial analysis of U.S. firms, and it attracts over 17 million visitors per month. We find that firm coverage initiation on SA significantly promotes corporate innovation activities. SA coverage promotes corporate innovation by disseminating innovation-related information about the covered firm to external investors, thereby alleviating the firm’s financial constraints. Moreover, firms with higher information asymmetry, firms facing greater product market competition, and firms having lower levels of managerial short-termism reveal a greater increase in innovation outcomes following SA coverage initiation. Taken together, our findings suggest that third party-generated information on specialized social media mitigates the information asymmetry between firms and investors on corporate innovation activities and encourages corporate innovation.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00995 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how competitive dynamics shape innovative firms’ voluntary disclosure of product quality information. Our empirical context is the pharmaceutical industry, where firms must decide whether to disclose private drug quality information acquired in clinical trials. Using a difference-in-difference strategy, we show that the approval of a competitor’s drug lowers the likelihood of a firm reporting its clinical trial results by 13%. We explore how these effects vary based on the project quality, competitor type, and firm experience. These findings suggest that strategic considerations play a role in firms’ disclosure decisions; in response to a competitor’s drug approval, firms may selectively withhold information to maintain and improve their competitive position.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: This work was funded by the National Institute on Aging [Grant T32-AG000186] and the UCLA Society of Hellman Fellows Program.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01161 .</content>

    <title>Can Improvements to Mobile Internet Service Help Reduce Digital Inequality? An Empirical Analysis of Education and Overall Data Consumption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Quality internet access is critical to participating in contemporary society. Unfortunately, many households—particularly those of low socioeconomic status and/or those in rural areas—do not have quality internet access. Some have no access, whereas others are reliant on their mobile data plans for internet access (i.e., they are “smartphone dependent”). This generates inequality in internet access and use. Given the smartphone dependence of many disadvantaged households, we explore whether improvements to mobile internet service can help reduce digital inequality. We focus on a specific improvement: access to unlimited mobile data. For access to unlimited data to help reduce digital inequality, it must generate larger data consumption increases for disadvantaged households than for advantaged ones, including for data likely to enhance welfare, such as online education content. It is not obvious that this will be the case. Accordingly, we use detailed subscriber-level data from a major telecommunications company to examine changes in the consumption of education and other content after subscribers switch to unlimited mobile data plans. We find that although all subscribers increase their consumption, the increases are significantly larger for disadvantaged subscribers, both for overall content and for education content. This is an important finding given that identifying programs that generate disproportionate data consumption increases for disadvantaged households—including for education and other “enhancing” content—is a necessary step for reducing digital inequality.This paper was accepted by Hemant Bhargava, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03770 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I examine changes in chief executive officer (CEO) labor market outcomes following corporate environmental failures. CEOs of firms subject to Environmental Protection Agency enforcements experience a decline in labor market opportunities as outside directors and a higher likelihood of dismissal as CEOs. They also receive less shareholder support in directorial elections. These effects are mostly visible in recent years and in firms with significant socially responsible investments (SRIs), and they are robust to using state environmental regulations for identification. Shareholders exhibit particular concern over environmental violations that may subject firms to future legal liabilities. Overall, these results point to significant reputational repercussions of environmental failures to CEOs and the disciplinary role of SRIs.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02372 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop an automated system to forecast volatility by leveraging more than 100 features and five machine learning algorithms. Considering the universe of S&amp;P 100 stocks, our system results in superior out-of-sample volatility forecasts compared with existing risk models across forecast horizons. We further demonstrate that our system remains robust to different specifications and is scalable to a broader S&amp;P 500 stock universe via hyperparameter transfer learning. Finally, the statistical improvement in volatility forecasts translates into significant annual returns from a cross-sectional variance risk premium strategy.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01520 .</content>

    <title>Managing Resources for Shared Micromobility: Approximate Optimality in Large-Scale Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider the problem of managing resources in shared micromobility systems (bike sharing and scooter sharing). An important task in managing such systems is periodic repositioning/recharging/sourcing of units to avoid stockouts or excess inventory at nodes with unbalanced flows. We consider a discrete-time model; each period begins with an initial inventory at each node in the network, and then, customers (demand) materialize at the nodes. Each customer picks up a unit at the origin node and drops it off at a randomly sampled destination node with an origin-specific probability distribution. We model the above network inventory management problem as an infinite horizon discrete-time discounted Markov decision process (MDP) and prove the asymptotic optimality of a novel mean-field approximation to the original MDP as the number of stations becomes large. To compute an approximately optimal policy for the mean-field dynamics, we provide an algorithm with a running time that is logarithmic in the desired optimality gap. Lastly, we compare the performance of our mean field-based policy with state-of-the-art heuristics via numerical experiments, including experiments using Austin scooter-sharing data.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02023 .</content>

    <title>Limited Firm Insurance and Aggregate Implications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the impacts of financial shocks on firm insurance, firm dynamics, and macroeconomic implications. A key departure from the literature is that firms provide wage insurance contracts to risk-averse workers in a long-term relationship. Such contracts endogenously impose a form of inflexible debt liability to firms, and make firms with limited financial net worth more vulnerable to shocks than others. In our model, firms have heterogenous productivity and financial net worth, and also firms face financial frictions. Search and matching in the labor market endogenously determines the value of wage contract, and thus the level of liability to the firm. We have three new findings: (1) The wage dynamics of the quantitative model are consistent with those in empirical studies, with significant insurance against firm-level idiosyncratic shocks, and also a weak comovement between aggregate wage and GDP when there are aggregate shocks. (2) Firms with limited financial resources are hit by financial shocks significantly more than others, with larger negative impacts on dividends, credit borrowing, firm value, and firm entry; the endogenous wage insurance also becomes more limited, and there are more separations. These impacts on both firms and workers are different from—and cannot be accounted for by—standard models with a representative firm or worker. (3) Quantitative exercises for the Great Recession in the United States suggest that aggregate productivity shocks and financial shocks play different roles; without financial shocks, we cannot account for the dynamics of financial variables, including the reduced credit borrowing, spikes in credit spreads, and large drops in dividend payments. Lastly, we provide microlevel empirical supports for our model implications.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: Y.

    <title>Higher Precision Is Not Always Better: Search Algorithm and Consumer Engagement</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;On decentralized e-commerce platforms, search algorithms play a critical role in matching buyers and sellers. A typical search algorithm routinely refines and improves its catalog of data to increase search precision, but the effects of a more precise search are little known. We evaluate such effects via a 2019 quasiexperiment on a world-leading e-commerce platform in which the search algorithm refined some product categories into finer subgroups to allocate consumer queries to more relevant product listings. Our data cover millions of consumers’ search and purchase behaviors over six months across multiple search sessions and product categories, enabling us to investigate trade-offs over time and across categories. We find that a more precise search algorithm improves consumers’ click-through and purchase rates drastically and instantaneously, but it comes at the cost of a significant decrease in consumer engagement and unplanned purchases over a longer time horizon. On average, consumers who used to spend more time searching now conduct 5.5% fewer searches, spend 4.1% less time on the platform, and decrease their spending on related categories by 2.2% in the week after the search precision increases. Our examination of the mechanisms behind these consequences calls for more careful search algorithm designs that account for not only instant conversion based on search precision but also consumer engagement and sellers’ strategic responses in the longer horizon.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: This work was supported by the Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72141305 and 72192803] and the Ministry of Education, People’s Republic of China (Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities), both to L.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impact of a boycott on one of the largest Korean dairy producers, triggered by the exposure of the firm’s unethical management practices, on sales of its own and others. We find empirical evidence that the boycott had substantial and long-lasting consequences. First, consumer utility from the boycotted products decreased significantly, reflecting consumers’ strong willingness to take part in collective action. Second, our discrete choice demand model, which addresses both price endogeneity and product substitution, estimates that sales of the boycotted firm decreased by almost 8% or, equivalently, by 8.1 million liters during the 12-month postboycott period. Third, the boycotted firm’s sales and revenue decreases would have been more severe had the firm not cut prices after the boycott outbreak. Our findings emphasize top-level managers’ role in fostering an ethical organizational culture within the firm and taking proper and timely countermeasures to curb losses incurred by a boycott.This paper was accepted by Eric Anderson, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the Asian Studies Center of Michigan State University [Dr. Delia Koo Faculty Endowment Award] and Sogang University [New Faculty Research Funding Grant 202310031.01].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.01062 .</content>

    <title>A Machine Learning Framework for Assessing Experts’ Decision Quality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Expert workers make non-trivial decisions with significant implications. Experts’ decision accuracy is, thus, a fundamental aspect of their judgment quality, key to both management and consumers of experts’ services. Yet, in many important settings, transparency in experts’ decision quality is rarely possible because ground truth data for evaluating the experts’ decisions is costly and available only for a limited set of decisions. Furthermore, different experts typically handle exclusive sets of decisions, and thus, prior solutions that rely on the aggregation of multiple experts’ decisions for the same instance are inapplicable. We first formulate the problem of estimating experts’ decision accuracy in this setting and then develop a machine–learning–based framework to address it. Our method effectively leverages both abundant historical data on workers’ past decisions and scarce decision instances with ground truth labels. Using both semi-synthetic data based on publicly available data sets and purposefully compiled data sets on real workers’ decisions, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations of our method’s performance relative to alternatives. The results show that our approach is superior to existing alternatives across diverse settings, including settings that involve different data domains, experts’ qualities, and amounts of ground truth data. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to posit and address the problem of estimating experts’ decision accuracies from historical data with scarce ground truth, and it is the first to offer comprehensive results for this problem setting, establishing the performances that can be achieved across settings as well as the state-of-the-art performance on which future work can build.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: T.

    <title>A Structural Topic and Sentiment-Discourse Model for Text Analysis</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider the common setting where one observes a large number of opinionated text documents and related covariates, such as the text of online reviews along with the date of the review and the author demographic information. In this setting it can be of interest to understand how the covariates determine the text composition, as well as the prevalence, sentiment, and/or discourse of various discussion themes. Yet, most topic modeling methods in the machine learning literature are designed to summarize the text for the purpose of exploratory analysis and not to perform this type of formal statistical inference. Further, topic modeling methods generally do not try to estimate the sentiment or discourse of discussion along separate topics that can be critical in business applications (e.g., for summarizing service or product quality). We develop a topic model called the structural topic and sentiment-discourse (STS) model that introduces a new document-level latent variable that captures the sentiment and/or discourse (termed as “sentiment-discourse”) for each topic, which modulates the word frequency within a topic. These latent topic sentiment-discourse variables are controlled by document-level covariates to allow for experimental control and regression analysis. We also introduce new computational methods to resolve scalability issues that have forced previous models to restrict to a small number of categorical covariates. We benchmark the STS model on three real-world data sets from surveys, blogs, and Yelp restaurant reviews around the COVID-19 pandemic. Our model recovers meaningful results including rich insights about how COVID-19 affects online reviews, demonstrating that the STS model can be useful for regression analysis with text data in addition to topic modeling’s traditional use of descriptive analysis.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00261 .

    <title>Quality Improvement Spillovers: Evidence from the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Quality knowledge spillovers can enhance the overall effectiveness of quality improvement initiatives. We study the presence and moderators of such spillovers in a multitask service setting, specifically in hospital inpatient care. Leveraging a national quality improvement regulation, the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), which offers partial incentives for hospitals to reduce readmissions, we employ difference-in-differences econometric models on a nationwide database and find positive quality spillovers in the healthcare sector. Our findings indicate that the implementation of HRRP led to a significant decrease in 30-day readmissions among patients with clinical conditions or insurance types that were not targeted by the policy. Additionally, we find that task similarity played a positive role in promoting quality spillovers, while a hospital’s operational focus on target patients (i.e., the proportion of hospital volume targeted by the policy) did not moderate these spillovers. Notably, we observe that hospitals achieved these quality improvements without increasing the intensity of care provided, and that meaningful improvements in quality were associated with up to a 3% reduction in hospitalization costs. This paper contributes novel insights into how regulators and policymakers can design narrow public policies and regulations that achieve broader results by exploiting the beneficial quality improvement spillovers of partial incentives.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: Support for this research was provided by the Alberta School of Business Faculty Seed Grant and the University of Wisconsin-Madison Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education, with funding from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01062 .</content>

Private information about betas, together with market makers’ risk aversion and mean betas’ nonnegativity, implies a nonlinear price schedule whose stochastic slope covaries positively with order flow when the expected factor payoff is positive and vice versa. We predict a negative relation between the covariance and expected returns and an attenuation of the beta anomaly in asset returns after accounting for this relation. Empirical tests confirm these predictions.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: L.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We find that equity loan fees, which have been largely ignored by the anomalies literature, are the best predictor of cross-sectional returns. When compared with 102 other anomalies and other short-selling measures, the loan fee anomaly has the highest monthly long-short return (4.01%), the highest monthly Sharpe Ratio (0.66), and, unlike other anomalies, exhibits strong persistence throughout the sample. Although prior work has shown that existing anomalies reside in high loan fee stocks, we find that 42% of loan fee outperformance is due to unique information not contained in other anomalies. Future papers that examine cross-sectional predictors of returns should include the single most effective predictor: loan fees.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00152 .</content>

    <title>On-Demand Delivery Platforms and Restaurant Sales</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Restaurants are increasingly relying on on-demand delivery platforms (e.g., DoorDash, Grubhub, and Uber Eats) to reach customers and fulfill takeout orders. Although on-demand delivery is a valuable option for consumers, whether restaurants benefit from or are being hurt by partnering with these platforms remains unclear. This paper investigates whether and to what extent the platform delivery channel substitutes restaurants’ own takeout/dine-in channels and the net impact on restaurant revenue. Empirical analyses show that restaurants overall benefit from on-demand delivery platforms—these platforms increase restaurants’ total takeout sales while creating positive spillovers to customer dine-in visits. However, the platform effects are substantially heterogeneous, depending on the type of restaurants (independent versus chain) and the type of customer channels (takeout versus dine-in). The overall positive effect on fast-food chains is four times as large as that on independent restaurants. For takeout, delivery platforms substitute independent restaurants’ but complement chain restaurants’ own takeout sales. For dine-in, delivery platforms increase both independent and chain restaurants’ dine-in visits by a similar magnitude. Therefore, the value of delivery platforms to independent restaurants mostly comes from the increase in dine-in visits, whereas the value to chain restaurants primarily comes from the gain in takeout sales. Further, the platform delivery channel facilitates price competition and reduces the opportunity for independent restaurants to differentiate with premium services and dine-in experience, which may explain why independent restaurants do not benefit as much from on-demand delivery platforms.This paper was accepted by D.

    <title>Price Formation in Markets with Trading Delays</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a parsimonious price formation model to study information aggregation and information acquisition in the presence of trading delays. If delays apply uniformly to uninformed and informed traders, the level of delays does not affect information aggregation. Traders’ information acquisition incentives are, however, weaker in a market with longer delays. Therefore, the equilibrium fraction of informed traders is lower if delays are longer, establishing an inverse relationship between trading delays and price informativeness. We also show that risk premia and price dispersion tend to be nonmonotonic functions of the level of delays when information acquisition is endogenous. We document novel empirical evidence from the UK corporate bond market, which largely corroborates the implications of our theory.This paper was accepted by Bruno Biais, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.01400 .</content>

    <title>Private Optimal Inventory Policy Learning for Feature-Based Newsvendor with Unknown Demand</title>
    <updated>2025-07-09T13:39:51+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The data-driven newsvendor problem with features has recently emerged as a significant area of research, driven by the proliferation of data across various sectors such as retail, supply chains, e-commerce, and healthcare. Given the sensitive nature of customer or organizational data often used in feature-based analysis, it is crucial to ensure individual privacy to uphold trust and confidence. Despite its importance, privacy preservation in the context of inventory planning remains unexplored. A key challenge is the nonsmoothness of the newsvendor loss function, which sets it apart from existing work on privacy-preserving algorithms in other settings. This paper introduces a novel approach to estimating a privacy-preserving optimal inventory policy within the f-differential privacy framework, an extension of the classical [Formula: see text]-differential privacy with several appealing properties. We develop a clipped noisy gradient descent algorithm based on convolution smoothing for optimal inventory estimation to simultaneously address three main challenges: (i) unknown demand distribution and nonsmooth loss function, (ii) provable privacy guarantees for individual-level data, and (iii) desirable statistical precision. We derive finite-sample high-probability bounds for optimal policy parameter estimation and regret analysis. By leveraging the structure of the newsvendor problem, we attain a faster excess population risk bound compared with that obtained from an indiscriminate application of existing results for general nonsmooth convex loss. Our bound aligns with that for strongly convex and smooth loss function. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed new method can achieve desirable privacy protection with a marginal increase in cost.This paper was accepted by J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most research on systemic stability assumes an economy where banks are subject to exogenous shocks. However, in practice, banks choose their exposure to risk. I show that there exists a network risk-taking externality: the risk exposure choices made by connected banks are strategically complementary. Banks within financial networks, especially densely connected ones, become endogenously exposed to excessive risks. The theory offers several novel perspectives on policy debates. For instance, it suggests that limiting government bailouts to interbank exposures can effectively reduce endogenous systemic risk.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: This work was financially supported by the USC Dornsife Institute for New Economic Thinking Fellowship, the Marshall PhD Fellowship, and European Finance Association Doctoral Tutorial Best Paper Prize.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01519 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether leveraged buyout (LBO) sponsors’ reputations as borrowers affect the refinancing terms of their portfolio companies. In 510 U.S. LBOs for which we can reconstruct debt financing activity, 67% of financing events occur one quarter before the earliest existing debt maturity. These On Time events generally improve borrowing terms, whereas Early events feature more dividends, leverage, and higher cost. In each case, dividend issuance decreases and cost increases with the proportion of the sponsors’ recent exits that are failures. Effects are absent for matched firms and prior to the LBO and are procyclical; sponsors with recent failures miss opportunities to decrease financing costs in good times.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00971 .</content>

    <title>Measuring Investor Attention Using Google Search</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although investor attention is fundamental to the efficient functioning of capital markets, it is also an elusive construct that researchers struggle to measure. In recent years, the search volume index (SVI) of ticker searches on Google has become a ubiquitous measure of investor attention, but the amount and effects of measurement error in ticker SVI are unknown. We investigate measurement error in ticker SVI using a data set of 2.7 billion website visits following Standard and Poor’s 500 firms’ ticker searches. We find that 69% of searches are unrelated to investing, that this measurement error is highly correlated with firm characteristics, and that this measurement error can easily generate false-positive or false-negative results in common settings. We go on to show that a modified version of SVI using both a firm’s ticker and the word “stock” (e.g., searches for “CAT stock,” which we label “ticker-stock SVI”) not only better captures the search terms that investors typically use, but also has considerably less measurement error that is largely uncorrelated with observable firm characteristics. Ticker-stock SVI produces better specified tests, and although researchers must still carefully consider the effects of measurement error, we recommend that ticker-stock SVI is used in place of ticker SVI in most settings. We provide a data set of ticker-stock SVI to facilitate future work.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivisan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02174 .

    <title>Auditor Skill Demands and Audit Quality: Evidence from Job Postings</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study empirically examines the relation between audit quality and auditors’ cognitive and social skills. Using a novel data set of online job postings by accounting firms, we document substantial variation in the stated demand for auditors’ cognitive and social skills, suggesting that audit offices are not homogeneous in their preferences for such skills. We find a positive relation between audit quality and the prevalence of cognitive and social skills within an audit office’s job postings. This association is stronger for audit engagements that are more complex or require greater coordination, suggesting that cognitive and social skills are particularly important in engagements where effective communication and knowledge transfer, as well as sound professional judgment and skepticism, are needed. The association is also stronger for audit offices with greater investments in new technology, consistent with the complementary relation between cognitive and social skills and the use of technology. Overall, our study offers empirical evidence linking specific auditor skills to audit quality.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: C.

    <title>Fiscal Stimulus, Deposit Competition, and the Rise of Shadow Banking: Evidence from China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise of shadow banking and attendant financial fragility in China can be traced to intensified deposit competition following the 2008–2009 global financial crisis (GFC). A large, state-owned bank’s deposits from cross-border money inflows fell significantly following the GFC, and it supported the government’s fiscal stimulus more aggressively than other large banks by issuing larger volumes of new loans. Small and medium-sized banks with more branch-level overlaps with this large bank relied more on shadow banking and issued more wealth management products (WMPs)—short-maturity, off-balance-sheet substitutes for deposits. Greater amounts of WMPs created rollover risks for the issuers, as reflected by higher yields on new WMPs, higher borrowing rates in the interbank market, and lower stock-market performance during liquidity stress.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 71272024, 71972051, and 72071117].Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04233 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show how manufacturers can benefit from contracts that incentivize retailers to purchase multiple products from the same manufacturer. We isolate two effects: first, under standard contractual inefficiencies, which give rise to double marginalization, such contracts can increase channel profits (the “improved contractual efficiency” effect); second, when a weaker product is tied to a particularly strong “must-stock” product, such contracts can also reduce a retailer’s position and shift rent to the manufacturer (the “increased rent extraction” effect). To harness these effects, we show that it can even be profitable for the manufacturer to introduce a weak product that ultimately has the effect of foreclosing a rival’s more efficient substitute. Nevertheless, unless the tying product is sufficiently strong, the overall effect on welfare can still be positive, providing manufacturers with an efficiency rationale to use against common concerns held by antitrust agencies about such practices.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many scholars have called for raising statistical hurdles to guard against false discoveries in academic publications. I show these calls may be difficult to justify empirically. Published data exhibit bias: Results that fail to meet existing hurdles are often unobserved. These unobserved results must be extrapolated, which can lead to weak identification of revised hurdles. In contrast, statistics that can target only published findings (e.g. empirical Bayes shrinkage and the false discovery rate) can be strongly identified, as data on published findings are plentiful. I demonstrate these results theoretically and in an empirical analysis of the cross-sectional return predictability literature.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03083 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crowdfunding can suffer from information asymmetry, leaving some investors disappointed with low-quality projects, whereas other high-quality projects remain unfunded. We show that refund bonuses, which provide investors a payment if a fundraising campaign is unsuccessful, can signal project quality and help overcome the market failure in crowdfunding. Because strong projects have a lower risk of bonus payout, entrepreneurs with strong projects are more likely to offer bonuses. This signals high quality to investors, and due to their updated beliefs, this drives investment toward such projects. An experiment provides supporting empirical evidence for the benefits of this signaling solution to the problems of information asymmetry in crowdfunding.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by Schmidt Sciences.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03923 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;By design, the Bitcoin protocol has a low throughput. The Lightning Network (LN) is a layer-two solution built to increase throughput by cryptographically securing commitments to transactions and only occasionally converting cumulative balances into on-chain transactions. LN channels enable payments between nodes connected by a path of channels. The payment flow through a channel determines its cost. Different channel topologies can support the same underlying flows but impose different costs. This paper obtains necessary conditions for cost-minimizing topologies by identifying local cost-reducing strategies. The first local strategy entails repositioning of channels. The second entails adding hubs to handle the flows of groups of nodes. The paper also evaluates the efficiency of a global configuration, obtaining bounds on the minimum cost topology and showing the unusual circumstances in which the cost minimal structure is a hub that connects to all other nodes.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: This work was partially supported by Science Foundation Ireland [Grants 16/IA/4443, 16/SPP/3347], Columbia-International Business Machines Center for Blockchain and Data Transparency, Chaire Fintech at University Paris Dauphine-Paris Sciences et Lettres, Algorand Foundation, and Simons Institute.</content>

    <title>Trading Flexibility for Adoption: From Dynamic to Static Walking in Ride-Sharing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;On-demand ride-sharing aims to fulfill riders’ transportation needs whenever and wherever they want. Although this service level appeals to riders, overall system efficiency can improve substantially if riders are willing to be flexible. Here, we explore riders’ flexibility in space via walking to more accessible pickup locations. Ride-sharing platforms have traditionally implemented dynamic walking to optimize rider pickup locations and rider-driver assignment jointly. We propose an alternative that we call static walking, which presents a predetermined pickup location to the rider before optimizing rider-driver assignment. Although dynamic walking enables more efficient matching of riders and drivers, we hypothesize that riders prefer static walking because of the certainty of the pickup location before booking the ride. Using simulations on Lyft data, we show that static walking can capture up to 96% of the value of dynamic walking in congested urban networks at a fixed adoption rate. Furthermore, experimentation on Lyft’s user interface suggests that providing riders with information on pickup location before an opt-in decision can increase walking adoption—to the extent that static walking may outperform dynamic walking overall. More broadly, this study highlights the importance of carefully designing flexibility mechanisms on platforms: a little flexibility goes a long way, especially when flexibility presents a barrier to adoption.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>Platform Financing vs. Trade Credit for Lending to Third-Party Sellers</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study platform financing in comparison with trade credit for lending to third-party sellers, considering scenarios where default risk is driven by external factors (exogenous) or influenced by the parties’ decisions (endogenous). Our findings indicate that under exogenous default risk, although platform financing exposes the platform to the seller’s default risk, it can enhance the seller’s sales by providing low-rate finance and reducing the wholesale price because the supplier remains isolated from default risk. Platform financing emerges in equilibrium, benefiting all parties, particularly in businesses facing significant default risk, high product costs, operating in small markets, or having a high commission rate. In cases of endogenous default risk, platform financing can mitigate the seller’s opportunistic behavior, either preventing or reducing default risk, and the effects of product costs and market uncertainty may become nonmonotonic. In certain scenarios, platform financing arises in equilibrium when the product cost is intermediate or sufficiently high but not in between and when market uncertainty is moderate but not low or high. We also explore the impacts of the seller’s initial capital and credit limits, providing valuable managerial insights.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: The corresponding author, X.

    <title>Capturing the Benefits of Autonomous Vehicles in Ride Hailing: The Role of Market Configuration</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop an economic model of autonomous vehicle (AV) ride-hailing markets, in which uncertain aggregate demand is served with a combination of a fixed fleet of AVs and a flexible pool of human drivers (HVs). Dispatch efficiencies increase with scale because of density effects. We analyze market outcomes in this setting under four market configurations, defined by two dispatch platform structures (common platform versus independent platforms) and two levels of supply competition (monopoly AV versus competitive AV). A key result of our analysis is that the lower cost of AVs does not necessarily translate into lower prices; the price impact of AVs is ambiguous and depends critically on both the dispatch platform structure and the level of AV supply competition. In the extreme case, we show that if AVs and HVs operate on independent dispatch platforms, there is a monopoly AV supplier, and labor supply elasticity is sufficiently high, then prices are even higher than in a pure-HV market. Indeed, to guarantee consistently lower prices (relative to a pure HV market) in all scenarios and under all supply and density elasticities, a common dispatch platform between AVs and HVs is required. Furthermore, competitive AVs lead to lower prices than monopoly AVs in every such scenario. Our results illustrate the critical role that market configuration plays in realizing potential welfare gains from AVs.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.03112 .</content>

    <title>Extubation Decisions with Predictive Information for Mechanically Ventilated Patients in the ICU</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Weaning patients from mechanical ventilators is a crucial decision in intensive care units (ICUs), significantly affecting patient outcomes and the throughput of ICUs. This study aims to improve the current extubation protocols by incorporating predictive information on patient health conditions. We develop a discrete-time, finite-horizon Markov decision process with predictions of future state to support extubation decisions. We characterize the structure of the optimal policy and provide important insights into how predictive information can lead to different decision protocols. We demonstrate that adding predictive information is always beneficial, even if physicians place excessive trust in the predictions, as long as the predictive model is moderately accurate. Using a comprehensive data set from an ICU in a tertiary hospital in Singapore, we evaluate the effectiveness of various policies and demonstrate that incorporating predictive information can reduce ICU length of stay by up to 3.4% and, simultaneously, decrease the extubation failure rate by up to 20.3%, compared with the optimal policy that does not utilize prediction. These benefits are more significant for patients with poor initial conditions upon ICU admission. Both our analytical and numerical findings suggest that predictive information is particularly valuable in identifying patients who could benefit from continued intubation, thereby allowing for personalized and delayed extubation for these patients.This paper was accepted by Carri Chan, healthcare management.Funding: This work was supported by the Academic Research Fund (AcRF) Tier 2, Ministry of Education, Singapore [Grant MOE2019-T2-1-185] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 71921001 and 72091210].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.01427 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The increasing number of institutions exploiting factor-investing strategies raises concerns that competition may erode profits. We use a game-theoretic model to show that, whereas competition among investors exploiting a particular factor erodes profits because of the negative externality of their price impact on each other, competition to exploit other factors can increase profits from the first factor because of the positive externality from trading diversification (netting of trades across factors). Using data for 18 factors as well as mutual fund holdings, we show that competition and trading diversification substantially affect the profits from factor investing.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: The authors received an INQUIRE-Europe research grant for this project.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02684 .</content>

    <title>A Simple and Optimal Policy Design with Safety Against Heavy-Tailed Risk for Stochastic Bandits</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem and design new policies that enjoy both optimal regret expectation and light-tailed risk for regret distribution. We first find that any policy that obtains the optimal instance-dependent expected regret could incur a heavy-tailed regret tail risk that decays slowly with T. We then focus on policies that achieve optimal worst-case expected regret. We design a novel policy that (i) enjoys the worst-case optimality for regret expectation and (ii) has the worst-case tail probability of incurring a regret larger than any regret threshold that decays exponentially with respect to T. The decaying rate is proved to be optimal for all worst-case optimal policies. Our proposed policy achieves a delicate balance between doing more exploration at the beginning of the time horizon and doing more exploitation when approaching the end, compared with standard confidence-bound-based policies. We also enhance the policy design to accommodate the “any-time” setting where T is unknown a priori, highlighting “lifelong exploration”, and prove equivalently desired policy performances as compared with the “fixed-time” setting with known T. From a managerial perspective, we show through numerical experiments that our new policy design yields similar efficiency and better safety compared to celebrated policies. Our policy design is preferable especially when (i) there is a risk of underestimating the volatility profile, or (ii) there is a challenge of tuning policy hyper-parameters. We conclude by extending our proposed policy design to the stochastic linear bandit setting that leads to both worst-case optimality in terms of regret expectation and light-tailed risk on regret distribution.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>Strategic Expert Committees and the Markets That Assess Them: A Laboratory Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Committees of experts are widely used to make decisions. We experimentally investigate the relationship between decision making in committees and the assessment of the ability of committee members by evaluators, comparing observed behavior with theoretical predictions. Treatments vary in whether members care only about a state-dependent project payoff or also about assessments and whether evaluators can base their assessments only on the decision the committee makes or also on cheap-talk statements made by committee members on their confidence in the committee decision. Evidence for the equilibrium predictions is mixed; for example, contrary to theory, committees with a concern for their assessment do not distort their decisions more than committees without, whereas in line with theory, evaluators give higher assessments to committees that take the risky decision rather than the riskless. We analyze whether evaluators rationally base their assessments on observed behavior of committees using an orthogonality test. In treatments with cheap-talk statements, assessments are quite rational; in treatments without, they are too low on average. We investigate whether committees best reply to expected project payoffs and, in treatments in which members’ payoffs also depend on assessments, to predicted assessments conditional on observed committee behavior. In all treatments, committees respond to the possibilities to raise expected payoffs but do not use them as much as predicted by theory. We conclude by showing that the amount of information about committee members’ abilities that ends up in assessments is considerably larger when evaluators observe committees’ decisions and statements rather than only decisions.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Dutch Research Council (NWO) under the grant 400-09-338; and Erasmus University Rotterdam [Grant CSTO 2014–54].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03007 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The growth of the influencer marketing industry warrants an empirical examination of the effect of posting sponsored videos on influencers’ reputations. We collected a novel data set of user-generated YouTube videos created by prominent English-speaking influencers in the beauty and style category. We extracted a rich set of theory-driven video features and used DiNardo-Fortin-Lemieux reweighting to construct comparable treatment and control groups matched at the influencer-video level. The empirical analysis of the matched sample revealed a reputation-burning effect; that is, posting a sponsored video, compared with posting an equivalent organic video, cost the influencers 0.19% of their reputation (operationalized as the number of subscribers). The reputation-burning effect was stronger among the influencers with larger audiences. An analysis of likes, comments, and comment texts revealed a larger gap in audience response between sponsored and organic videos among the influencers with larger (versus smaller) audiences. The reputation-burning effect was mitigated when a high fit existed between the sponsored content and the influencer’s “usual” content and when the promoted brand was less well known. Our study empirically tested the assumption of several theoretical works. Moreover, it contributes to the literature on influencer marketing and celebrity endorsements and provides managerial implications for influencers, brands, and social media platforms.This paper was accepted by D.

    <title>Approximation Algorithms for Dynamic Inventory Management on Networks</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide the first approximation algorithm for dynamic inventory management on a network with stochastic demand and backlogging. Specifically, under a mild cost condition, we prove the cost of a specially designed base-stock policy is less than 1.618 times the cost of an optimal policy. We develop a novel stochastic programming analysis to prove this result: We carefully calibrate two stochastic programs (providing upper and lower bounds on the optimal policy), and compare their objectives. The upper bound arises from a new class of base-stock policies we define to address the currently unresolved issue of how to assign and fulfill backlogs in a system with fulfillment flexibility. We show the optimal policy in this class takes a simple and intuitive form: backlogs are assigned to their lowest cost activities for replenishment, and the ordered resources for those activities are committed to the backlogs for fulfillment. Next, the lower bound stochastic program is derived through a novel cost accounting scheme that captures the tradeoff between current inventory decisions and future backlog decisions. We then exploit this tradeoff to bound the ratio of the two stochastic program objectives and prove our main result. We also demonstrate our policy’s practicality with numerical simulations that show it performs within 1% of optimal on average across a wide range of problem instances. Finally, we show that our techniques and results extend to more general settings, demonstrating their potential for broader applicability. Importantly, our approach extends to problems with lead times, where we prove an approximation guarantee for base-stock policies that is independent of both the lead time and network structure. Thus, our work provides the new managerial insight that properly designed base-stock policies can be effective in network settings.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02965 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide robust evidence that rank-and-file employee stock options (R&amp;F options) lead to lower work-related injury rates. This finding is consistent with the view that R&amp;F options improve workplace safety by facilitating employee retention and cooperation. To establish causality, we employ difference-in-differences analysis around the passage of FAS 123R option expensing regulation and instrumental variable estimation. In cross-sectional analysis, we find that the documented effect is amplified among firms with higher labor mobility rates and among firms with greater scope for employee free riding. The results of supplemental analysis suggest that work-related injuries adversely impact firm performance and rule out reduced employee whistleblowing about workplace safety issues as an alternative mechanism driving our findings.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02072 .</content>

    <title>A Minibatch Stochastic Gradient Descent-Based Learning Metapolicy for Inventory Systems with Myopic Optimal Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has proven effective in solving many inventory control problems with demand learning. However, it often faces the pitfall of an infeasible target inventory level that is lower than the current inventory level. Several recent works have been successful in resolving this issue in various inventory systems. However, their techniques are rather sophisticated and difficult to apply to more complicated scenarios, such as multiproduct and multiconstraint inventory systems. In this paper, we address the infeasible target inventory-level issue from a new technical perspective; we propose a novel minibatch SGD-based metapolicy. Our metapolicy is flexible enough to be applied to a general inventory systems framework covering a wide range of inventory management problems with myopic clairvoyant optimal policy. By devising the optimal minibatch scheme, our metapolicy achieves a regret bound of [Formula: see text] for the general convex case and [Formula: see text] for the strongly convex case. To demonstrate the power and flexibility of our metapolicy, we apply it to three important inventory control problems, multiproduct and multiconstraint systems, multiechelon serial systems, and one-warehouse and multistore systems, by carefully designing application-specific subroutines. We also conduct extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate that our metapolicy enjoys competitive regret performance, high computational efficiency, and low variances among a wide range of applications.This paper was accepted by J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do individuals anticipate time inconsistency in others? This paper jointly investigates beliefs about one’s own and others’ present bias. In an online laboratory experiment, participants engaged in a real-effort task display little awareness of their own present bias but anticipate present bias in others. Structurally, I estimate a present bias parameter [Formula: see text] of 0.82. Participants perceive others’ [Formula: see text] to be 0.87, indicating substantial sophistication, contrasted with 1.03 for themselves, indicating full naïveté. At the individual level, asymmetric naïveté correlates with overoptimism regarding one’s own versus others’ task enjoyment and time availability. The wedge in beliefs about present bias can inform equilibrium outcomes in a number of collaborative, competitive, and hierarchical settings, including teams in the workplace, management practices such as deadlines and tournament incentive schemes, and household consumption decisions.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: Financial support from the Laboratory for Economic Applications and Policy (Harvard University); Pershing Square Venture Fund for Research on the Foundations of Human Behavior (Harvard University); Harvard Business School (PhD Research Budget); and the Russell Sage Foundation (Small Research Grant) is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.01780 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do digital payment technologies generate liquidity premia like cash and Treasury? We provide an estimate in the context of the world’s largest digital payment platform, Alipay. Our empirical strategy exploits the variation in the timing of the introduction of money market funds that users on this platform can hold and use for digital transactions. We find that, once a fund becomes eligible for these transactions, its size increases by 45 times on average. Through the lens of an equilibrium demand system model, we show that this size increase implies a liquidity premium of 0.8% per annum. This result provides a unique perspective for understanding and calibrating the liquidity premium of digital currencies.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01309 .</content>

    <title>Does Employing Skilled Immigrants Enhance Competitive Performance? Evidence from European Football Clubs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the effect of employing skilled immigrants on the competitive performance of organizations by studying European football (soccer) clubs in Germany, Italy, France, England, and Spain from 1990 to 2020. Microdata from this setting offers unusual transparency about players’ birthplaces and their contributions to organizational performance. Further, country-level rules govern how many immigrant players clubs can deploy. Using changes to these rules as the basis for instrumental variables, we find that the number of immigrant players in the club’s starting lineup has a positive local average treatment effect on the club’s performance. We show that this occurs for two related reasons. First, immigrants exhibit higher individual talent. Second, immigrants play a coordinating role that enables the organization to broaden the variety of on-field strategies and actions it uses to outperform rivals. The latter mechanism is novel to the literature.This paper was accepted by Olav Sorenson, organizations.Funding: F.

    <title>EXPRESS: Who Will I Be With(out) You? Consequences of Perceived Romantic Relationship Status Stability on Product Rentals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The current research identifies perceived romantic relationship status stability (RSS)—the degree to which one anticipates their current relationship status to remain unchanged in the foreseeable future—as a significant factor that impacts consumers’ likelihood of renting products. Analyses of field data and experimental studies reveal that low (vs. high) RSS increases consumers’ preference for renting, but not purchasing, products. The effect holds both for low-risk products consumed individually (i.e., when a romantic partner or relationship status is less likely to matter in the acquisition decision) and for high-risk acquisitions such as owning vs. renting a home across representative samples of the US population. The effect occurs because low RSS, an indicator of lower perceived self-concept continuity, heightens the motivation for self-expansion. In contrast to purchasing, renting is a flexible and low-commitment acquisition method that helps consumers self-expand by exploring new products while not inhibiting future explorations. As such, the heightened motivation for self-expansion caused by low RSS increases consumers’ preference for renting but does not influence their preference for purchasing. Managerially, our findings present marketers with insights on to whom and/or when to provide rental versus purchase options, and how to communicate these options to different consumer segments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Information about the social context of consumption is often seen on review websites or social media when consumers sharing word-of-mouth about an experience indicate whether they engaged in the activity solo or with companions. Across a secondary dataset scraped from Tripadvisor.com, five main experiments, and one supplemental experiment, the current research finds that individuals who engage in consumption activities alone can be a more influential source of recommendations than people who engage in these same activities with others. The results support an attribution-based process, such that people are more likely to attribute a solo (vs. accompanied) review to the quality of the activity itself, leading the solo (vs. accompanied) person’s review to be particularly influential. Further, the studies test the theorizing that perceived interest on the part of the solo (vs. accompanied) consumer leads to the stronger attribution to quality, and therefore that additional cues to intrinsic interest (e.g., presence of a cue to intrinsic or extrinsic motivation) attenuate the influence of solo (vs. accompanied) word-of-mouth. This work has theoretical and managerial relevance for those who seek to understand how the social context of consumption influences other consumers.</content>

    <title>Second-Order Knowledge Intermediaries and Multi-Country Entrepreneurial Entry into a Nascent Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How can a knowledge intermediary support industry development and entrepreneurial entry in countries where it is not present? This study introduces a two-stage model of multi-country entrepreneurial entry via second-order knowledge intermediaries (SOKIs). In Stage 1, SOKIs acquire and develop industry-building knowledge and capabilities from engagement with the activities of carrying, co-creating, capacity building, and convening of a first-order knowledge intermediary (FOKI). In Stage 2, motivated SOKIs implement these activities in secondary countries, supporting local industry development. The model is developed in the context of the clean cookstove industry, which addresses global health and environmental challenges among low-income populations. Qualitative evidence from 25 interviews and archival data were used to describe how SOKIs learned transferable knowledge and capabilities in primary countries. A quantitative analysis of data derived from 1,996 clean cookstove organizations operating across 113 countries (2013–2019) was conducted to assess whether a greater number of SOKIs in secondary countries was associated with increased entrepreneurial entries. Results support the model; more SOKIs were associated with more entrepreneurial entries, and this relationship was weakened when company and nonprofit SOKIs were imbalanced and when more domestic industry actors possessed overlapping knowledge. This study contributes to the literature on industry emergence by introducing a mechanism of non-firm-led, cross-border knowledge diffusion in mission-oriented industries. It also shows how local entrepreneurs in under-resourced contexts can access global knowledge—not through firms or FOKIs but through SOKIs that extend the FOKIs’ work.Funding: This work was supported by funding from the University of Michigan, including the C.K.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the use of a prevalent but rarely studied form of intellectual property protection: trade secrecy. Building on existing survey evidence of firm-level, cross-sectional use of secrecy, we document the effect of stronger legal protections for trade secrets on the project-level use of such secrets. Our setting is the U.S. oil and gas hydraulic fracturing industry, from 2014 to 2018, in states where firms are required to disclose fracturing fluid ingredients to regulators except for substantiated claims of trade secrets. We examine how the enactment of the federal 2016 Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) affects well-level trade secret use across states with varying levels of pre-DTSA protection. We find substantial increases in the use and novelty of trade secrets. Further, wells with trade secret ingredients are, on average, more productive. However, the DTSA exerts limited additional effect on trade secret–related productivity. Supplementary tests address alternative explanations, show no evidence of intellectual property substitution, and provide additional support that we are capturing policy effects. Our results provide rare empirical evidence on actual trade secret use and enhance our understanding of how appropriability shapes use of trade secrets and associated inventive activity.This paper was accepted by Toby Stuart, entrepreneurship and innovation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01138 .</content>

    <title>The Need for Speed: The Impact of Capital Constraints on Strategic Misconduct</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing literature suggests that firms engage in misconduct in response to financial pressure. However, the extent and severity of misconduct have been challenging to determine given the lack of granular data. This limitation is particularly true for smaller firms in emerging markets whose profitability and survival depend on misconduct. This study analyzes the impact of reducing capital constraints on misconduct using high-frequency global positioning system and financing data from the minibus taxi industry in South Africa. I find that lower interest rates, a proxy for lower capital constraints, decrease the most severe forms of misconduct measured by the propensity to speed and crash yet leave more modest forms of misconduct unchanged. Qualitative interviews and survey data suggest that these results are attributable to firms’ efforts to avoid default. These findings contribute to understanding misconduct as a firm strategy when facing financial pressure and suggest that lower capital constraints might improve firm survival and public safety.This paper was accepted by Lamar Pierce, organizations.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01957 .</content>

    <title>Oasis in the desert or icing on the cake? The impact of entrepreneurship accelerators across ecosystems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The effectiveness of accelerators in fostering new venture development has traditionally been attributed to variations in their internal operations and design, with limited consideration of contextual factors. This study broadens the understanding of accelerators by situating their roles in relation to entrepreneurial ecosystems and introducing a multi-level framework on how macro-level institutions and meso-level accelerator programs interact to shape venture growth. By linking organizational theories on accelerators with institutional economics, this research juxtaposes and tests two perspectives: institutional voids and institutional support. On the one hand, accelerators address institutional voids by acting as intermediaries in entrepreneurial resource markets through knowledge and resource curation, network brokerage, and signaling. On the other hand, the effectiveness of these intermediation roles is constrained by the quality of institutions. Contrary to the prevailing belief that accelerators deliver greater value in underdeveloped institutional environments with inefficient entrepreneurial resource markets, the findings reveal that ventures in such contexts derive less growth benefit from accelerators. This study contributes to the growing body of comparative and international accelerator research and offers broader implications for meso-level intervention programs, suggesting these programs require working in concert with robust ecosystems rather than operating in isolation in order to achieve their intended objectives.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify strong cross-border property rights as a driver for the globalization of innovation. Using 67 million patents from over 100 patent offices, we construct novel measures of the three stages of innovation diffusion: adoption, sourcing, and collaboration. Exploiting staggered bilateral investment treaties (BITs) as shocks to cross-border property rights, we show that signatory countries increase technology adoption and sourcing from each other; they also increase R&amp;D collaborations. The results are particularly strong for countries with weak domestic institutions and technologies with high imitation risks. Increases in R&amp;D-related foreign investments explain most of the results.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Exploring the minimum wage policy discontinuities at county borders, we find that minimum wage hikes induce industrial firms to pollute more and reduce their abatement efforts. State ownership mitigates these negative effects, suggesting its role in addressing externality. The adverse environmental impacts are attenuated by the staggered increase in pollution discharge fees across provinces. These effects are stronger for firms with higher minimum wage sensitivity, lower market power, and greater financial constraints, and for firms that are the subsidiaries of nonlisted companies. Overall, our findings highlight the unintended environmental consequences of labor market policies.</content>

    <title>Beyond Neoliberalism: The Role of Community in the Responsibilization of Citizen-Consumers During the Great Recession</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Drawing on governmentality theory, we examine the formation of responsibilized citizen-consumers during Ireland’s Great Recession (2008–2013). Through qualitative analysis of consumer interviews, media and political discourses, and macro consumer data, we advance understanding in governmentality and consumer responsibilization research by theorizing communal responsibilization as a distinct, culturally-embedded process. We contrast neoliberal and communal moral frames in responsibilizing citizen-consumers, and in this process of “shared responsibility,” we show how many citizen-consumers faced ideological, economic, and structural barriers to acting as self-reliant subjects. We find that communal frames and myths were particularly effective in alleviating some of these tensions by fostering relational interdependencies and communal solidarity, thus enabling the moral internalization of responsibility amongst citizen-consumers, both for themselves and others. We identify key mechanisms through which communities facilitated responsibilization and a re-casting of citizen-consumer subjectivities: social scaffolding, informal resource exchange, active citizenship, and communal entrepreneurship. Finally, we identify tensions and community disintegration as key barriers in the communal responsibilization process. Overall, our findings advance consumer research on responsibilization, consumption communities, and mythmaking.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can diversity lead to greater research focus on populations underrepresented in science? Between 1960 and 1990, 76 all-male US universities transitioned to coeducation. Using a generalized difference-in-differences design, we find that coeducation led to a 44 percent increase in gender-related research publications. This increase is driven by research focused on female subjects and gender differences. While coeducation led to a compositional shift with more women and researchers interested in gender topics, much of the increase comes from male incumbent researchers shifting their research focus toward gender-related topics. The results support interaction with more diverse students and peers as key underlying mechanisms. (JEL I23, J16, O31, O34)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Children spend years in foster care, and bureaucratic hurdles can unnecessarily prolong their stays. The Mi Abogado program was introduced in Chile to enhance legal aid for foster children and accelerate family reunification. In a novel approach, the Chilean government randomized the introduction of the program for children living in institutions to evaluate effects on child well-being. Using registry data, we find the program significantly reduced the duration of foster care without increasing subsequent maltreatment and placements. The exposure also decreased criminal justice involvement and improved school attendance. Results suggest that strengthening foster care services can cost-effectively improve child well-being.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies, through a randomized field experiment involving community health workers in Pakistan, if public sector organizations can improve worker performance by investing in their mission motivation. The findings reveal that training aimed at strengthening mission motivation improves workers' performance in their core responsibility of monthly household visits, as well as in multiple tasks performed during and outside these visits. This holistic improvement in performance leads to improved health outcomes for children in the communities served by these workers. These results highlight the importance of promoting organizational missions as a strategy to improve public sector performance in low-income countries.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The US net foreign asset position declined sharply after 2007, reaching negative 60 percent of GDP by the third quarter of 2023. This deterioration primarily reflects a US-specific rise in corporate asset values that inflated the value of US equity liabilities to the rest of the world. To interpret these trends, we develop an international macrofinance model of flows, stocks, asset valuations, the current account, and the net foreign asset position. We find that the welfare impact of rising asset values for a representative US household has been quite negative given extensive foreign ownership of US corporate equity.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper analyzes recognition of women's innovative ideas compared to men's using bibliometric data in economics, mathematics, and sociology. I establish similarities between papers to construct relevant counterfactual citations. On average, all-female papers receive 10 percent fewer citations than all-male papers, a disparity reduced by 40 percent when considering team sizes and disappearing in most fields with authors' publication records. Additionally, strong in-group preferences emerge: All-male teams omit more papers with women, and vice versa. Accounting for publication histories, female scholars are cited 0 percent (economics) to 11 percent (mathematics) less, with early-career women enduring a 9–14 percent citation penalty.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how a large increase in the price level is transmitted to the real economy through firm balance sheets. Using newly digitized macro- and micro-level data from the German inflation of 1919–1923, we show inflation led to a large reduction in real debt burdens and bankruptcies. Firms with higher nominal liabilities at the onset of inflation experienced a larger decline in interest expenses, a relative increase in their equity values, and higher employment during the inflation. The results are consistent with real effects of a debt-inflation channel that operates even when prices and wages are flexible. (JEL D22, E23, E31, G32, N14, N24)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a model to study when an intermediate action can serve as a stepping stone that enables the elimination of a harmful norm. While the intermediate action may facilitate the first “step,” it may also become a new norm. We derive intuitive conditions for stepping stones, which depend on the relative size of social penalties and intrinsic utility benefits. We propose an econometric approach to testing whether an intermediate action is a stepping stone, and apply it to original data on female genital cutting in Somalia. The analysis shows that the intermediate action may become the new norm. (JEL I12, J16, O15, O17, Z13)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a field experiment with US households to study how expectations about long-run home price growth shape spending decisions. We exogenously vary survey respondents' expectations by providing different expert forecasts. Homeowners' spending, measured using rich home-scanner data, is inelastic to home price expectations. By contrast, renters reduce their spending when expecting higher home price growth. These patterns reflect positive wealth effects for owners from higher future wealth and negative income effects for both groups due to higher future housing costs. Our study highlights consequences of asset price growth and long-term expectations about the economy for household behavior. (JEL C93, D12, D84, D91, G51, R31)</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Military spending has large and persistent effects on output because it shifts the composition of public spending toward R&amp;D. This boosts innovation and private investment in the medium term and increases productivity and GDP at longer horizons. Public R&amp;D expenditure stimulates economic activities beyond the business cycle even when it is not associated with war spending. In contrast, the effects of public investment are shorter-lived, while public consumption has a modest impact at most horizons. We reach these conclusions using BVAR with long lags and 125 years of US data, including newly reconstructed series of government spending by main categories since 1890.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Normal-form two-player games are categorized by players into K analogy classes so as to minimize the prediction error about the behavior of the opponent. This results in Clustered Analogy-Based Expectation Equilibria in which strategies are analogy-based expectation equilibria given the analogy partitions and analogy partitions minimize the prediction errors given the strategies. We distinguish between environments with self-repelling analogy partitions in which some mixing over partitions is required and environments with self-attractive partitions in which several analogy partitions can arise, thereby suggesting new channels of belief heterogeneity and equilibrium multiplicity. Various economic applications are discussed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Unemployment differentials are greater between countries in the euro area than between U.S. states. In both regions, net migration responds to unemployment differentials, though the response is smaller in the euro area compared to the United States. We use a multi-country DSGE model with cross-border migration to quantify Mundell’s hypothesis that labor mobility could substitute for independent monetary policy in a currency union. While not as effective as independent monetary policy, increased labor mobility reduces business cycle fluctuations for most countries in the euro area. However, Mundell’s conjecture does not hold uniformly. For countries that primarily face demand shocks, labor mobility stabilizes inflation and unemployment and improves welfare. If supply shocks are dominant however, labor mobility increases the cost of being in a currency union by magnifying inflation volatility.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a state-dependent “distributive decision rule” for simultaneous capacity allocation and job assignment decisions in a multiperiod stochastic resource allocation context with random supply replenishment, random demand, job waiting and abandonment. Our decision rule can be reformulated into a convex optimization problem with polynomial number of constraints and decision variables. Our framework can be applied in many service management settings such as ride-sharing fleet repositioning and patient management in healthcare. In simulations, our framework records 1%–15% improvements over alternative paradigms such as fluid approximations and approximate dynamic programming.</content>

    <title>Behavioral Externalities of Process Automation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the behavioral effects of process automation on human workers interacting with automated tasks. We introduce a stylized normative model with two workers who complete their tasks sequentially, working toward a joint project to obtain a fixed payment plus a variable bonus that depends on how early the project is completed. The normative model prescribes that, if workers are fully rational, they will complete their tasks as soon as possible if the early completion bonus is high enough. However, following the literature, we hypothesize that workers will suboptimally delay project completion. Following the insights from a behavioral model, we further predict that automation will alleviate this problem by reducing strategic uncertainty, resulting in an indirect behavioral benefit of a higher worker productivity, in addition to the direct benefit of a higher project completion rate and a shorter project duration. To test these predictions, we conduct an experiment replicating the theoretical model, varying (i) whether a worker collaborates with a coworker or a robot, and (ii) in the case of collaborating with a robot, whether the upstream or downstream task is the one automated. First, we find that workers largely deviate from the optimal policy, as they take longer than what the normative theory prescribes to complete their tasks or do not complete the project. Second, we show that process automation increases the project completion rate and reduces the project completion time, confirming the benefits of process automation. Interestingly, workers who collaborate with robots take longer to complete their tasks, contradicting our initial hypothesis that process automation has a positive effect on the productivity of human workers. In addition, we find that upstream automation is more beneficial than downstream automation. We also show that social preferences are an important driver of these results because prosocial subjects tend to be more productive when collaborating with a human coworker than with a robot. Finally, we show that our findings remain robust in a continuous processing setting.This paper was accepted by Felipe Caro for the Management Science Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from Zicklin School of Business, Baruch College, the City University of New York, and the University of Texas at Dallas.

    <title>Food Ordering and Delivery: How Platforms and Restaurants Should Split the Pie</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Food ordering and delivery platforms generate online demand for restaurants and deliver food to customers. In return, restaurants pay platforms a commission, typically a percentage of the order amount. Platforms offer partner restaurants the choice of a range of commission rates, rewarding higher commission payments with featured display slots and discounted delivery fees, both of which stimulate demand. Unfortunately, the current environment is grim: Platforms scurry to cover delivery costs, whereas restaurants gripe about excessive commissions. To understand current practice, we develop a game-theoretic model with a platform and multiple restaurants. Our modeling results highlight two existing problems. (1) Platforms, on their apps/websites, feature restaurants that are located too far away. Because these restaurants do not internalize the platform’s delivery costs, they are willing to choose aggressively high commissions to earn featured display. (2) Platforms charge delivery fees that are too high and set delivery boundaries that are too narrow. This is because they bear the entire burden of delivery but earn only a fraction of food revenues. To solve these problems, we propose a simple fix to existing commission contracts: beyond sharing food revenue (currently done but at high commission rates), platforms and restaurants can also split delivery costs and fees (currently not done). We show that our method attains first-best, that is, maximizes the total pie shared by platforms and restaurants. Using data on a representative city, we numerically show that, on average, our coordinating contract lowers commission rates by 33.3%, lowers delivery fees by 40.4%, increases restaurant profit by 25.0%, increases platform profit in 30.9% of the markets, and increases total profit by 13.3%. We discuss the characteristics of markets that enable our coordinating contract to yield a winning outcome for all parties.This paper was accepted by Karan Girotra, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00435 .</content>

    <title>What Are Family Firms All About? Advancing Family Business Research Through Socioemotional Wealth Theory</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It has been almost 20 years since socioemotional wealth (SEW) emerged as one of the main paradigms in family business research. From its inception this theory has been widely used to study a variety of phenomena unique to family firms yet there is limited understanding of what SEW is and how it works. Using the wisdom of accumulated research, we delve into the scholarly debate surrounding SEW as a dominant yet controversial paradigm within the family business field. We critically assess the existing knowledge on SEW with the aim of reexamining its core assumptions and existing limitations. Furthermore, we incorporate insights from 330 scholarly articles that have been published after SEW was first introduced in 2007 to explore its origins and implicit assumptions. We examine the often‐ambiguous results of SEW research and the oversimplified portrayal of family firms as ‘irrational’ or ‘risk‐averse’. We highlight critical, unclear areas in the SEW's body of work to help guide future SEW research in the coming decades.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using an experiment in which 3.1 million bank customers were encouraged to save, we explore the mechanisms behind coholding liquid savings and credit card debt. Theoretically, we show that the joint responses of spending, saving, and borrowing to the nudge differ across economic models of coholding. Using machine learning techniques, we find that the most responsive individuals reduce spending and increase savings by 4.9% (206 USD PPP per month) while their credit card debt remains unchanged. These individuals' marginal responses to the nudge are consistent with our model of coholding for the purpose of self‐ or partner‐control.</content>

    <title>Does corporate social responsibility increase access to finance? A commentary on Cheng et al. (2014)</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scholars have long investigated the possible benefits of corporate social responsibility (CSR). One of the most influential of these studies tests and supports the hypothesis that CSR increases access to finance. Yet, I show here that the finding is unsound because the report's empirical method limits what can be inferred from its analysis. I rectify a key weakness and replicate the study. I observe a cross‐sectional association but find no evidence that CSR increases access to finance. My analysis suggests new directions for research on the effect of CSR.Managerial SummaryNumerous articles have explored the possible benefits of CSR. A highly influential study claims that CSR improves a corporation's ability to access capital, and this finding has been widely used by scholars, fund managers, and policymakers. Unfortunately, the finding is unsound because the study's research method used predicted values of access to capital rather than direct measures. A rectification and extension of the original analysis fails to uncover evidence that firm‐level changes in CSR are associated with access to capital.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;CEOs increasingly engage in activism on controversial social and political issues, such as police reform, LGBTQ+ rights, and gun control, to influence the behavior of policymakers. We run an experiment on 514 local elected politicians to examine how revealing information about CEO activism on police reform affects the views of policymakers. Additionally, we examine how CEOs’ controversial positions on social issues affect politicians’ willingness to privately meet with CEOs or publicly advocate for their businesses. We do not find that revealing CEO support for specific police reform policies affects policymakers’ opinions. Policymakers, however, are much less willing to engage—either privately or publicly—with CEOs who take controversial positions on social issues. These results do not vary with local economic conditions or the salience of police reform, but they appear to be driven by policymakers’ personal ideological commitments. Our results suggest that CEO activism may have limited influence on local politicians, at least on the topic of police reform, and they underscore the business costs of CEOs taking political positions. We discuss the implications for CEOs and the activist groups that often pressure them to take public positions on controversial issues.Funding: This work was funded by the UCLA Anderson School of Management and University of Virginia Darden School of Business.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18282 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Once information about leasing and corporate structure is incorporated into the way financial leverage is calculated, highly leveraged care homes are found to have a death rate twice as high as that of non-leveraged care homes before the government provided financial support (i.e., during the first wave). Highly leveraged care homes cut costs more aggressively and experienced the largest drop in cash reserves. Care homes controlled by private equity firms no longer display higher COVID-19 death rates once their significantly higher leverage is controlled for. Our results illustrate the importance of accurately measuring financial flexibility and the negative externalities caused by high leverage.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02923 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the importance of information technology (IT) in banking for entrepreneurship. Guided by a parsimonious model, we establish that job creation by young firms is stronger in U.S. counties more exposed to banks with greater IT adoption. We present evidence consistent with banks’ IT adoption spurring entrepreneurship through a collateral channel: entrepreneurship increases by more in IT-exposed counties when house prices rise. Further analysis suggests that IT improves banks’ ability to determine collateral values, in particular when collateral appraisal is more complex. IT also reduces the time and cost of disbursing collateralized loans.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02555 .</content>

    <title>Why Horizontal Organizations Don’t Fall Flat: Organizational Structure Shapes Perceptions of Egalitarianism and Company Warmth</title>
    <updated>2025-07-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, a growing number of companies have evolved toward relatively “flat” management structures with minimal hierarchical layers of management. Some even leverage this flatness as a key marketing message and defining element of corporate identity. Although organizational structure has been studied extensively throughout various disciplines, its influence on consumer response has received little attention. This research reveals that a company’s organizational structure can shape consumer perceptions of and subsequent responses to the company. All else being equal, perceived organizational flatness (vs. tallness) tends to induce more positive consumer reactions, such as increased purchase amounts, advertising engagement, purchase intentions, crowdfunding contributions, and brand choice. This phenomenon occurs because consumers infer that flatter companies foster relational egalitarianism, which, in turn, enhances perceived company warmth. However, the positive effect of perceived flatness is not universal. It is eliminated or reversed among people with a lower preference for egalitarianism, and those with conservative political ideologies. This work enriches our understanding of how a company’s organizational attributes, which are usually regarded as beyond the consumer’s purview, may shape consumer perceptions of the company, offering insights for businesses as they embrace new ways of communicating and promoting themselves to consumers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the dynamics of information demand and supply in capital markets, focusing on how firms’ disclosures align with analysts’ information needs. Using a novel dataset from Visible Alpha, we analyze granular data from analysts’ forecasting models to understand the breadth of information they seek and how firms meet these demands through mandatory and voluntary disclosures. We document significant variation in the complexity of analysts’ models and the extent of firms’ disclosures, leading to some items in analysts’ models remaining undisclosed. This unmet information demand gives rise to a novel concept we term “uncertainty about the past” (UP). We investigate its implications for key capital market outcomes, including analyst forecast dispersion, market reactions to earnings announcements, and stock market liquidity. Our results demonstrate thatUPplays a significant role in shaping the information environment, challenging the assumption that earnings announcements fully resolve uncertainty about past performance.</content>

Our survey intends to guide corporate management and regulators in navigating the ESG disclosure terrain. Rather than summarizing the vast and growing ESG literature, we assess the economic arguments for ESG disclosure regulation and the form of this disclosure. We discuss investors’ demand for ESG information and its supply by publicly traded firms. We analyze the case for and against mandatory ESG disclosure. Finally, we weigh the efficiency of disclosure requirement characteristics, assuming mandatory ESG disclosure is warranted. We intend to be positive rather than prescriptive, providing a line of reasoning readers can employ to reach their own conclusions about what we ought to do.</content>

    <title>Is the Price Right? The Role of Economic Trade-Offs in Explaining Reactions to Price Surges</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Public authorities often introduce price controls following price surges, potentially causing inefficiencies and exacerbating shortages. A survey experiment with 7,612 Canadian and U.S. respondents shows that unregulated price surges raise moral objections and widespread disapproval. However, acceptance increases and demand for regulation declines when participants are prompted to consider economic trade-offs between controlled and unregulated prices, whereby incentives from higher prices lead to additional supply and enhance access to goods. Moreover, highlighting these trade-offs reduces polarization in moral judgments between supporters and opponents of unregulated pricing. Textual analysis of responses to open-ended questions provides further insights into our findings, and an incentivized donation task demonstrates consistency between stated preferences and real-stakes behavior. Although economic trade-offs do influence public support for price control policies, the evidence indicates that even when the potential gains in economic efficiency from unregulated prices are explicit, a significant divide persists between the utilitarian views that standard economic thinking implies and the nonutilitarian values held by the general population.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by Johns Hopkins “Catalyst Award” and Business of Health Initiative (HBHI) and the Sandra Rotman Centre for Health Sector Strategy at the University of Toronto.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04555 .</content>

    <title>The Power of Disagreement: A Field Experiment to Investigate Human–Algorithm Collaboration in Loan Evaluations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human–algorithm collaboration is becoming increasingly prevalent in the economy and society. However, this collaboration is not always fruitful, and in extreme cases, people become human borgs or totally averse to algorithms. The key to collaborative value is whether humans and algorithms can complement each other in decision making, but it is challenging for humans to disagree with algorithmic recommendations at the right time (i.e., to disagree when algorithms are wrong and not disagree when algorithms are right). To understand the centric role of disagreement in human–algorithm collaboration and examine when and how it benefits, we conducted a field experiment in which human evaluators and algorithms worked together to evaluate loan applications under four scenarios, that is, limited/rich information and with/without disclosure of algorithm rationale. Our results show that human–algorithm collaboration decisions outperformed human- or algorithm-only decisions, and these collaborative values varied across the four scenarios. We further propose a theoretical framework for mechanism examination that centers on the formation and effectiveness of disagreement. We validate the framework empirically and come to the following findings: (1) disagreement exhibits a sizable and nonlinear influence on collaborative value, (2) the differences between human evaluators and algorithms in decision making contribute to disagreement but not to collaborative value, (3) algorithm self-contradiction triggers disagreement and helps human evaluators disagree with algorithms at the right time. These findings provide valuable theoretical insights on how collaborative value is achieved and managerial insights on how to manage disagreement in human–algorithm collaboration.This paper has been accepted by Hemant Bhargava for the Special Issue on The Human–Algorithm Connection.Funding: Y.

Now that the abilities of AI systems have started to approach this initial aspiration, organization and management scholars face a challenge in how to theorize this technology, which potentially changes the way we view technology: not as a tool, but as something that enters previously human‐only domains. To navigate this theorizing challenge, we adopt the problematizing review method by engaging in a selective and critical reading of the theoretical contributions regarding AI, in the most influential organization and management journals. We examine how the literature has grounded itself with AI as the root metaphor and what field assumptions about AI are shared – or contested – in the field. We uncover two core assumptions of rationality and anthropomorphism, around which fruitful debates are already emerging. We discuss these two assumptions and their organizational boundary conditions in the context of theorizing AI. Finally, we invite scholars to build distinctive organization and management theory scaffolding within the broader social science of AI.</content>

    <title>Do Gender-Role Violations in Initiating Structure and Consideration Help or Harm Employee Stress and Well-Being?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although prior research has noted the stress-reducing effects of leaders’ initiating structure and consideration, these behaviors are often gendered, with initiating structure as agentic, masculine behavior and consideration as communal, feminine behavior. Given these gender-role expectations, we examine whether there are different implications of women and men leaders’ initiating structure and consideration in relation to employee stress and well-being. Integrating expectancy violation theory and stress appraisal theory, we argue that perceived leader behaviors that violate gender roles (i.e., initiating structure by women leaders and consideration by men leaders) will be more powerful in reducing employee threat appraisals, which then reduces self-regulation depletion and in turn enriches employee well-being. Two studies—a time-separated field study and a set of experiments—support our proposals. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.</content>

    <title>Privacy protection laws, national culture, and artificial intelligence innovation around the world</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A substantial body of research highlights how stringent regulations disrupt innovators’ incentives and increase transaction costs, yet their information processing implication remains understudied. Building on information processing theory, we study how the interplay between formal and informal institutions shapes inventors’ information processing in developing artificial intelligence (AI) innovation. We examine the effect of stringent privacy regulations on AI innovation by exploiting the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) announcement. We argue that, following the GDPR announcement, GDPR-affected countries experience lower national AI innovation rates than unaffected countries. Further, we postulate that this negative effect is weaker in GDPR-affected countries, marked by higher levels of individualism, masculinity, and indulgence, but stronger in the affected countries with higher levels of uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and long-term orientation. Our difference-in-differences analysis supports the proposed framework. Our research contributes to the international business literature by developing novel theoretical predictions at the intersection of comparative institutional analysis and national culture, explaining how privacy protection laws and cultural factors shape AI inventors’ information processing. Finally, this study provides insights into how inventors and entrepreneurs in countries with stringent privacy laws can leverage national culture to shape their AI innovation strategies and inform strategic decision-making.</content>

    <title>The Marketplace of Existential Authenticity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traditionally, being authentic is regarded as something one is, where an entity is judged to possess the appropriate ‘authenticity’ attributes independently acquired outside of marketplace pressures. We consider two factors that challenge this traditional view to arrive at an alternative view of authenticity. First, we draw on existentialism that describes authenticity as a process of self-creation that occurs in interaction with others. Second, we consider neoliberal ideology whereby consumers are regarded as fully immersed market actors. By examining social media influencers (SMIs) who foster authenticity with overt marketization efforts, we identify a marketplace of existential authenticity where public performances of self-creation by an SMI are accompanied by resolute vulnerability that is valorized as work, thus warranting monetization. This cultural space of existentialism, where authenticity is something one does (vs. something one is), is governed by a ‘reflexive synopticon:’ a form of governmentality that shapes the actions of participants (SMIs, audience members, and the social media platform) through their mutual reflection on each other. Our work articulates how neoliberal horizontal governmentality structures operate, which includes the enabling (vs. antagonistic) role of the market. Moreover, our findings emphasize the culturally bound nature of different types of authenticities.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice-oriented abstractThis study investigates how actively engaging potential backers through timely responses in campaign discussion boards influences fundraising success on reward-based crowdfunding platforms. Our findings reveal several critical implications. First, responses from campaign starters significantly attract new contributors. Second, starter response amplifies the “herding effect,” where the number of pledged backers attracts more new backers. Last, although achieving funding goals typically reduces momentum, we find that ongoing engagement via active response to backer comments mitigates this decline and sustains backer interest. Practically, fundraisers should actively manage discussions to signal trustworthiness, commitment, and manage expectations. Platforms can enhance communication effectiveness by summarizing key discussion sentiments, highlighting frequent topics, and integrating tools like live chat to foster efficient real-time communication. Adopting these practices can significantly enhance crowdfunding effectiveness and sustainability.</content>

    <title>Does Social Bot Help Socialize? Evidence from a Microblogging Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leveraging advancements in large language models, social media platforms are increasingly deploying sophisticated chatbots, termed social bots, with the potential to stimulate user interaction. However, concerns linger regarding the socializing value of these bots in public settings. We investigate this phenomenon using data from the launch of CommentRobot on a microblogging platform. Analyzing user interactions with this platform-owned bot, we find that posts receiving bot-generated comments experience increased user engagement, demonstrating the socializing value of social bots at the post level. Results from an online experiment confirm this finding and reveal that the socializing value stems from both bot identity and high-quality content. Mechanism tests suggest that the quality of bot-generated comments—particularly their attractiveness, relevance, and inclusion of social cues—significantly influences user engagement. Moreover, we evaluate existing bot targeting strategies and propose policy learning-based improvements to optimize engagement. Despite the positive impact on post-level engagement, we find that receiving bot comments primarily encourages future bot-related posts rather than increasing overall user posting activity, contrary to platform expectations. Our findings highlight the need for platforms to refine social bot deployment strategies to maximize user engagement while mitigating unintended consequences.</content>

    <title>Emotionality in Political Social Media Communications: The Moderating Role of Audience Diversity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Politicians are increasingly turning to social media to engage with the public. At a time marked by extreme partisanship, rhetoric is often emotionally charged. But does this help or hinder efforts to engage followers and attract new ones? Our research examines how the emotionality of U.S. senators’ tweets affects both engagement (e.g., shares) and follower growth. Although emotional posts can increase engagement, this effect diminishes for senators from ideologically diverse battleground states, especially when the emotion is negative. For diverse constituencies, less emotional content may actually lead to greater engagement. Although emotionality can fuel engagement, it is the substantive content of posts that drives follower growth. These findings have implications for political discourse and communication strategy. Although intensely emotional and negative posts may energize a homogeneous base, they can alienate broader audiences and do not attract new followers. Beyond politics, content creators must be mindful of audience heterogeneity and be judicious in the use of emotionally charged messaging.</content>

However, how ecosystems emerge and evolve remains unexplored. In a question‐based examination of the solar photovoltaic ecosystem, we observe that ecosystems emerge earlier than predicted through the “transfer” of ecosystem elements, in a process of “re‐specialization,” and ecosystem roles from adjacent ecosystems. Second, the larger ecosystem has a unique life cycle, expanding while the focal industry contracts. Third, variance in institutional regime logic and orientation shapes where and how ecosystems evolve. Finally, bottlenecks shape ecosystem evolution, leading to an expansion in the bottleneck element through both new entry and migration from other ecosystem areas.Managerial AbstractInnovation ecosystems, or the larger group of firms producing components and complements, play a pivotal role in the ability of firms to create value with an innovation.

    <title>Yes, We (Still) Can! A Qualitative Study on the Dynamic Process of Team Resilience</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on psychological resilience in the workplace is on the rise, aiming to better understand how to successfully manage adverse events. Although scholars have started to explore the concept of team resilience, the focus of the theory on team resilience has been largely on cognitive mechanisms. However, neglecting the role of relational mechanisms discounts the collaboration and social interaction that are necessary for successful teamwork, especially in the face of adverse events. To address this research gap, we conducted a qualitative study with a palliative care team that experienced work-related adverse events. Based on our data and applying conservation of resources theory, we develop a process model of team resilience. This model specifies the experience of adverse events as loss events and illustrates how teams can counteract these losses and enact team resilience through the relational process of caring. Caring in teams can be enacted through four dimensions, which we refer to as understanding, being with, doing for, and enabling. By enacting these caring dimensions, teams can heal social safety and collective action capabilities and can moreover build valuable resources, which may buffer resource loss and fuel resource growth in subsequent team resilience episodes. Our findings provide a better understanding of the role of relational processes in team resilience enactment and specify caring as a core relational mechanism that enables team resilient outcomes. Overall, we provide a nuanced understanding of the different elements within a team resilience process.</content>

    <title>Shades of Grey or Black and White? How Entrepreneurs’ Use of Cognitively Complex Language Affects Investor Funding</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how entrepreneurs’ use of cognitively complex language—language that involves nuance, differentiation, and comparison—influences funding decisions of early-stage investors. Our theorizing builds on the notion that individuals interpret language as a social signal and attribute another person’s language use to that person’s general dispositions. On this basis, we surmise that investors perceive an entrepreneur as more cognitively complex—that is, engaging in more nuanced and differentiated thinking—the more the entrepreneur uses cognitively complex language. Arguing that perceived cognitive complexity matches investors’ prototypical construals of entrepreneurial competence, we hypothesize a positive relationship between an entrepreneur’s use of cognitively complex language and the investment amount they receive. Drawing on our theoretical framework, we also argue that signaling cognitive complexity has a decreasing marginal effect, and that elite education functions as a credibility signal, amplifying the association between cognitively complex language and investment amount. A field study of 547 actual investment pitches and a randomized experiment with 240 professionals support our ideas. Our study introduces a more nuanced portrayal of complexity in entrepreneurial communication, accentuates the role of entrepreneurs’ signals of cognitive dispositions, and introduces the concept of cognitive complexity, and linguistic displays thereof, to entrepreneurship theory.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper argues that a lesser known yet economically significant tax-deferral feature of ETFs’ security design is crucial to their success. By relying on the in-kind redemption exemption, authorized participants help ETFs avoid distributing capital gains and reduce their tax overhang, partly by deploying heartbeat trades. We estimate that the ETF tax efficiency has increased long-term investors’ after-tax returns by 1.05% per year relative to mutual funds in recent years. Exploiting cross-sectional and time-series variations in investors’ tax burden, we show that tax efficiency is a significant driver of capital migration by high-net-worth investors from mutual funds into ETFs.

    <title>Bargaining Foundations for the Outside Option Principle</title>
    <updated>2025-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Dilip Abreu, Mihai Manea</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a bargaining game in which a seller can trade with one of two buyers, who have values h and l (h &amp;gt; l). The outside option principle (OOP) predicts that the seller trades with the high-value buyer with probability converging to 1 at a price converging to max (h/2,l) as players become patient. While this prediction is supported by the Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE), a wide range of trading outcomes may emerge in subgame perfect equilibria (SPEs): in the patient limit, the seller can obtain any price in the interval [h/2,h] (and no other); moreover, allocative inefficiency and costly delay are possible. We propose equilibrium refinements less restrictive than Markov behavior that guarantee trading outcomes consistent with the OOP. One refinement requires that a buyer's relative probability of trade does not increase dramatically following a failed negotiation with that buyer. Another refinement posits that the seller does not approach a buyer hoping that negotiations fail. SPEs satisfying both refinements conform with the OOP (but need not be MPEs). Our benchmark model features strategic matching by the seller. We provide a parallel analysis for the random matching protocol. Under random matching, prices in SPEs may also rise above and fall below l, but have a narrower range. A refinement particular to this protocol that restores the OOP requires that a random mismatch should not impact the seller excessively.</content>

    <title>Legislators’ demand for firms’ financial statements: evidence from U.S. congressional redistricting events</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate whether U.S. House representatives and their staff seek financial information from constituent firms to inform their legislative decisions. We exploit shifts in U.S. congressional districts (i.e., the reconfiguration of federal district lines or redistricting) that introduce new constituent firms to legislators’ districts. To the extent that legislators and their staff collect and rely on firms’ financial statement information, we expect that a change in representation as a result of redistricting will result in a significant and observable change in searches for information about new constituent firms. Our evidence supports this prediction. We also find that the timing of searching coincides with legislators’ roll call votes, particularly ahead of more controversial bills and for bills lobbied by sample firms. Finally, we find that new constituent firms respond to increased information demands after a redistricting event by supplying more policy-relevant disclosures and increasing lobbying.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Joint Shelf Design and Space Planning Problem with Placement Options</title>
    <updated>2025-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Sandra Zajac, Heinrich Kuhn</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper introduces the first joint shelf design and space planning problem that considers two placement options for items – hanging and shelving – on flexible shelves. These types of shelves are used in sectors such as do-it-yourself and toy retail, and for household goods in grocery stores. However, they have received limited attention in the literature, which typically focuses on regular shelves with a single placement option: placing items on shelf panels. The problem requires three interdependent decisions: (1) the placement option for each item (shelving or hanging), (2) the shelf design (number and vertical positioning of shelf panels), and (3) the shelf space planning (assignment of facings as well as the vertical and horizontal positioning of items). We formalize this problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and develop a greedy multi-start matheuristic to efficiently solve practical instances. Computational experiments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms both a commercial solver and a benchmark method for two-dimensional shelf space planning in terms of runtime and solution quality.A comprehensive analysis of synthetic instances and a real-world case study provides several managerial insights. First, hanging items enables more flexible use of shelf space, which is especially beneficial when item variety is high. However, when large vertical grabbing gaps must be considered, stacking items on shelf panels may be more advantageous. In turn, there is a risk of wasted space due to height or width mismatches. Second, the number and size of the segments on the shelf significantly influence layout profitability, highlighting the need to jointly optimize shelf design and space allocation. Third, it is common practice to arrange hanging items in horizontal rows, which can be facilitated by segmenting the shelf space. While this improves visual appeal, increasing the number of segments tends to reduce overall space utilization and profitability. Finally, a real-world case study involving 237 products across six categories from a European grocery retailer confirms the practical applicability of our approach. It demonstrates significant potential for improving space utilization and layout efficiency.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, the authors examine the impact of star creator exits on digital content markets, leveraging exogenous events on Twitch.tv. Using a Synthetic DiD approach, they estimate the causal effects of star creators’ exits from the live streaming platform. Their findings reveal that, at the live streaming category level, the exit of a star creator leads to a sizable decrease in both content provision and consumption within the star creator’s focal category. At the individual creator level, the effects are heterogeneous, varying by the creator’s audience size and contractual status with the platform. Major creators reduce their content provision, while micro creators maintain their streaming activity, though both groups experience a decline in viewership. Additionally, contracted creators tend to sustain their content provision levels following a star creator’s exit, whereas non-contracted creators exhibit a significant decline. Lastly, the authors find that the impact of a star creator’s departure persists for several months, indicating a lasting effect at both the category and individual levels.</content>

Although MNEs’ desire for a reputation for positive societal impact is well-established in the literature, much less is known about how to actually obtain one—especially in less developed frontier markets. In this inductive, qualitative study across seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa, we examine why host country stakeholders deem some foreign MNEs to have a better reputation for societal impact than others and how firms’ actions and attributes influence these stakeholder perceptions. Leveraging signaling theory, we identify three distinct types of signals (compatible, crossed, and conflicting) and three critical factors (benefit diffusion, empowerment, and hybrid solutions) that shape MNEs’ reputation for societal impact. We also shed light on the role of contextual factors at the country, industry, and community levels. In addition to these theoretical contributions, our study also yields practical implications for MNEs of including local stakeholders’ perspectives when crafting market and nonmarket strategies, fostering constructive communication between headquarters and subsidiaries as well as between expatriate and local actors, and finding ways of going beyond ‘fitting in’ to instead ‘stand out’ in order to gain a reputation for providing tangible and intangible forms of societal impact in frontier markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Wholesale market makers pay for retail options orders that must be executed on exchanges. Payment for order flow (PFOF) wholesalers compete via price improvement in exchange auctions. To attract retail orders, wholesalers run more auctions when their recent price improvement has been lower. However, auction price improvement lowers market maker revenues. Wholesalers earn revenues to pay PFOF in nonauction trades where their designated market maker status increases their execution priority. While some auctions produce substantial price improvement, most do not have multiple bidders offering meaningful price improvement. Overall, options market structure better promotes competition in auctions than in nonauctions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyse the behaviour of multinational enterprises (MNEs) within a host nation – Australia – during deglobalization (1914–79). Deglobalization is often portrayed as a drastic event to which MNEs respond swiftly, probably through withdrawal from host countries. However, we generate new FDI and firm population data to reveal incumbent MNEs remained. We then deploy historical primary evidence from three companies to analyse their responses. Firms adapted by deepening their local engagement, drawing on local information sources and entrepreneurship, and by shifting some strategic control to the subsidiary. These adaptations extended across decades, as each MNE wrestled with knowledge gaps and organizational rigidities that reflected its particular administrative heritage. Our historical methodology also reveals how firms were affected differently, responded at different speeds, and varied in their subsequent embeddedness. We conclude that deglobalization's impact on firms may be a subtle, reiterative, and prolonged process, rather than a sudden and dramatic event.</content>
