    <title>Defending the throne: The influence of performance feedback on &lt;scp&gt;CEO&lt;/scp&gt; succession in family‐controlled firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore how dominant coalitions' political goals influence firms' responses to performance feedback, introducing the concept of political slack. We propose that dominant coalitions use opportunities created by strong firm performance to make changes that reinforce their dominance while making defensive maneuvers to neutralize threats to their dominance posed by poor performance. A dominant coalition's ability to execute such strategic moves hinges on how much political slack it has. An analysis of South Korean family‐controlled firms shows that family coalitions with high political slack are more likely to be able to retain the incumbent family CEO despite below‐aspiration performance or to undertake CEO succession to a next‐generation family member, even when above‐aspiration performance favors retaining the incumbent CEO, than family coalitions with low political slack.Managerial SummaryA firm's performance has crucial implications for CEO succession. The conventional wisdom is that CEO succession is determined mainly by firm performance under the incumbent CEO. We uncovered a novel pattern of results in which CEO succession decisions are significantly influenced by the firm value created collectively by previous CEOs from the dominant coalition. The greater the collective value they have created, the more likely the dominant coalition will be able to appoint its preferred CEO, even when short‐term firm performance calls for other CEOs. Our study offers insights that can help a firm's stakeholders anticipate and counter the dominant coalition's political maneuvers to strengthen its control to ensure proper corporate governance.</content>

    <title>How Alternative Management Ideas Are Realized for the Public Good: Performative Fabrics of Humanistic Practices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Repurposing management for the public good involves realizing alternative ideas to serve societal interests. Humanistic management is centred on such ideas as human dignity and well‐being. Realization refers to the generation and maintenance of social realities corresponding to these ideas. The conceptual lens of performativity is uniquely suited for studying realization but requires broadening to capture the wider set of practices involved. Accordingly, we explore the wider performative practices that realize humanistic management ideas and how they do so. We studied three cases through a thematic analysis of 165 interviews, secondary sources, and observations. Our framework explains how humanistic management ideas were realized through performative fabrics of practices, interwoven heterogeneous practices that make and keep the embedded humanistic management ideas real. Performing, interweaving, and reweaving dynamics continuously shape these fabrics of interrelated humanizing, seeding, and nurturing practices. The fabrics generated four types of realizations of humanistic management ideas: potentialities, anomalies, normalities, and transferabilities. We prime a change in the conversation from studies of individual performative practices to relational studies of performative fabrics of practices. We also advance the performativity discussion to understand generativity, stabilization, defence, and reformativity. Our framework contributes theoretically and practically to repurposing management for the public good and offers insight into desirable future making.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study attention utility, the hedonic pleasure or pain derived purely from paying attention to information, which differs from the news utility that arises from gaining new information. The main, field, study examines brokerage account login data to show that investors pay disproportionate attention to already-known positive information on their stocks. Through its effect on logins, this selective attention affects their trading activity. Three experimental studies then show that (1) investors are more likely to engage in a paid task that will involve attention to a prior investment if that investment has gained value; (2) paying attention to a winning stock is more motivating than a doubling of monetary incentives; and that (3) attention has value independent of information acquisition.</content>

    <title>Putting out the Fires: The Role of Team Knowledge, Coordination, and Procedural Rigidity in Adapting and Performing During Disruptive Events</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research develops a theory of team adaptation to disruptive events (the extent to which an event transforms usual activities). Our theory is based on a comprehensive investigation of firefighting teams, documenting how disruptive team task changes (i.e., disruptive events) create a lack of correspondence between what team members expect to happen (preexisting task mental models or TMMs) and what is happening in the situation (emergent team situation mental models or TSMs) and the reactions that assist in their adaptation to these changes. We find that teams navigated the lack of correspondence by shifting from implicit to explicit coordination processes to effectively adapt. In Study 1, we gathered data from 350 firefighters in Chile composing 46 teams performing emergency missions. We find that the more disruptive the events experienced, the less the TMM-TSM corresponded; this relationship was influenced by procedural rigidity as highly rigid procedures impair sensitivity to situational modifications. When teams had low TMM-TSM correspondence, explicit coordination enabled them to save more property and lives. Study 2, employing a laboratory experiment, confirmed that, when low correspondence between TMMs and TSMs resulted in explicit coordination, simulated firefighting teams were better able to accomplish their missions. Across both field and experimental settings, our results extend theory and offer practical guidance to managers regarding how to support teams coping with disruptive events to avoid the dysfunctional consequences of overly rigid protocols.Funding: This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Innovation and Science [Grant PID2020-113394GB-I00] and the Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences [Grant ARI W911NF-16-1-0545].</content>

    <title>Optimal Abort Policy for Mission-Critical Systems Under Imperfect Condition Monitoring</title>
    <updated>2025-05-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Controlling stochastic systems often relies on the assumption of Markovian dynamics. However, this assumption frequently breaks down in mission-critical systems subject to failures—such as drones for power grid inspections—where the system failure rate increases over time. To enhance system survivability, operators may choose to abort missions based on noisy condition-monitoring signals. Yet, determining the optimal abort time in such settings leads to an intractable stopping problem under partial observability and non-Markovian behavior. In “Optimal Abort Policy for Mission-Critical Systems Under Imperfect Condition Monitoring,” Sun, Hu, and Ye introduce a novel Erlang mixture-based approximation that transforms the original non-Markovian process into continuous-time Markov chains. This approximation enables the formulation of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), whose optimal policies are shown to converge almost surely to the original optimal abort decision rules as the Erlang rate increases. Structural properties of the optimal POMDP policy are established, and a modified point-based value iteration algorithm is proposed to numerically solve the POMDP.</content>

    <title>Marketplace Expansion Through Marquee Seller Adoption: Externalities and Reputation Implications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the race to establish themselves, many early-stage online marketplaces choose to accelerate their growth by adding marquee (established brand name) sellers. We study the implications of marquee seller entry on smaller, unbranded sellers in a marketplace when both unbranded sellers and marquee sellers can vary vertically across reputation (referred to as sellers’ quality). Although recent literature has shown that higher-quality unbranded sellers fare better than their lower-quality peers, we posit that this may not hold for entrants of any quality. To this end, we collaborate with an online business-to-business platform and exploit the entry of two marquee sellers of vastly differing quality. Using a difference-in-difference-in-differences framework, we causally identify the effect. We find that, although higher-quality unbranded seller revenues increase relative to low-quality unbranded sellers when the entrant is of superior quality (consistent with the literature), the effect is reversed when the entrant is of inferior quality. Further, unbranded sellers change their supply quantities such that the platform’s average supply quality shifts in the direction of entrant quality. Using a stylized theoretical model, we identify two mechanisms that drive our findings: (i) new buyers brought in by the entrant disproportionately favor unbranded sellers who are quality neighbors to the entrant and (ii) the unbranded seller’s ability to adjust their supply quantities. Most notably, the choice of marquee sellers, examined through the lens of their externality on unbranded sellers, can foster or undermine the platform’s long-term growth objectives.This paper was accepted by Victor Martinez de Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03606 .</content>

    <title>The Politics of Product Safety: Top Management Team Political Ideology and Serious Medical Product Recalls</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is growing research exploring the influence of executives’ political ideologies on firm strategy, but little is known about how these ideologies influence product quality. Leveraging research that suggests liberal firm leaders prioritize customer safety, whereas conservative firm leaders emphasize firm financial returns, we theorize that a firm’s top management team’s (TMT’s) political ideology influences the number of serious medical product recalls that a firm initiates and how quickly the firm initiates them. Analyzing political donations recorded by the Federal Election Committee from top executives of 88 firms that had 4,072 serious medical product recalls from 2002 through 2015, we find that as firms’ TMTs are more liberal, they issue fewer recalls, but as firms’ TMTs are more conservative, they initiate recalls faster. Results suggest that firms with TMTs one standard deviation more liberal than the mean issue 1.10 fewer recalls per year, but take 22 days longer to initiate them. Findings from a post hoc analysis lend support to our theorizing, as we find that product quality-related adverse events act as a mechanism explaining the relationship between TMT political ideology and recalls. Firms with more liberal TMTs experience fewer product quality-related adverse events, and this reduction in adverse events acts as a mediator to partially explain the reduction in the number of recalls that more liberal firms initiate. Post hoc analyses provide support for an important firm implication; firms with more politically diverse TMTs have fewer recalls, similar to more liberal TMTs, and faster recalls, similar to more conservative TMTs.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03045 .</content>

    <title>Analytics Capability, Supply Chain Capabilities, and Operational Performance: A Meta‐Analytic Investigation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does the development of Analytics Capability (AC) of a firm influence its supply chain performance? With increasing numbers of firms adopting data analytics to enhance their supply chains and overall performance, this question has become particularly important. To answer the question, this study proposes and tests three dominant supply chain capabilities (integration, flexibility, and resilience) as key mechanisms through which AC is linked with operational performance. We use 405 effect sizes reported in 174 prior empirical studies based on data gathered from 104,296 informants to draw insights using a meta‐analytic structural equation modeling approach. The theory developed herein contributes to the literature by demonstrating thatintegration, flexibility,andresiliencemediate the association between AC and operational performance, which in turn affects customer service performance. Specifically, a substantial degree of variance in the effects of AC on operational performance is mediated by integration, flexibility, and resilience, respectively. We also find that the effect size for the association between AC and operational performance is higher in developing economies, while the link between operational performance and customer service performance is higher in developed economies. Our analyses are robust to several empirical challenges, including (a) common method bias, (b) outliers, (c) endogeneity, and (d) journal quality, attesting to the stability of the findings. Overall, our results suggest that supply chain integration, flexibility, and resilience are key domains of managerial and theoretical focus for implementing firms' data analytics initiatives, reinforcing the role of the supply chain in leveraging data analytics capabilities.</content>

    <title>Fast Fashion Consumption Signals Low Self-Control</title>
    <updated>2025-05-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We argue that the fast fashion business model has three defining characteristics: high trendiness, high disposability, and unsustainable practices. These characteristics collectively suggest that consumers of fast fashion brands have a short-term focus, which evokes the perception that they lack self-control. A ChatGPT study and six experiments (five pre-registered) provide convergent evidence for the effect of fast fashion consumption on perceived self-control (H1). We establish that this effect is mediated by the belief that fast fashion consumers maintain a short-term focus (H2). Additionally, fast fashion consumers are viewed as having lower self-control compared to consumers of luxury, mid-luxury, and supermarket fashion (H3). Serious consumers of fast fashion are perceived to have lower self-control than casual consumers (H4). Furthermore, this effect disappears when cues (e.g., sustainability) imply a long-term focus among consumers (H5). Finally, we reveal the downstream consequences of this effect, offering important insights for consumers and marketers. For instance, fast fashion consumers and influencers are seen as less compatible with products, services, jobs, and activities associated with self-control and long-term benefits (H6). Overall, our research enhances our understanding of fast fashion consumption and contributes to broader discussions on self-control, consumption-based inference-making, and interpersonal perception.</content>

    <title>Investors' attention and the paradox of technologically related diversification: Evidence of stock market mispricing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that multi‐business firms pursuing technologically related diversification often face a paradox. While such strategies can yield superior financial performance through technological synergies, investors with limited attention tend to undervalue them due to their complexity. Using asset pricing methods, we find that these firms consistently outperform market expectations. The degree of mispricing depends on investor attention and the availability of information needed to assess the strategy's value. Our findings highlight how informational frictions can distort market valuations of complex corporate strategies.Managerial SummaryFirms diversifying across technologically related businesses may unlock significant value through synergies—but this value is often missed by investors. The complexity of these strategies challenges investor understanding, leading to market undervaluation. We find that improving how firms communicate their technological capabilities—such as using clearer, more familiar language in patent disclosures—can enhance investor recognition and improve market valuations.</content>

    <title>Fast and Slow Arbitrage: The Predictive Power of (Persistent) Capital Flows for Factor Returns</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that persistent aggregate capital flows to hedge and mutual funds predict monthly factor returns with an out-of-sample R  2 reaching 6.6%. Transient flows display no such power despite being more predictable. We show—both empirically and theoretically—that persistent flows’ predictive power stems from active fund managers’ capital constraints. Consequently, managers invest persistent but not transient flows into factor trading strategies, leading to factor-return predictability and factor momentum yet greater price efficiency. Our key insight is that capital-constrained managers account for both current and anticipated future flows in the arbitrage sector, incorporating the dynamics of capital into their strategies.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study optimal nonlinear taxation of single and married households. Taxes on couples depend on the earnings of both spouses and are an example of multidimensional tax schedules. We develop novel analytical techniques to study properties of such taxes. We show that the optimal marginal taxes for married individuals are generally lower than for single individuals because resource sharing in couples provides socially valuable redistribution. Under realistic assumptions, the optimal tax rates for married individuals increase with the correlation of spousal earnings, the marginal tax rates for one spouse increase (decrease) in the earnings of the other if both spouses have low (high) earnings, and the primary earner faces lower marginal taxes than the secondary earner.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is wide agreement about the potential for hybridity – the combination of plural organizational forms – to address complex societal grand challenges. Unfortunately, advancements in this area have been unduly constrained by the fragmentation of research along the organizational unit of analysis. This Special Issue advances research by offering a framework that bridges hybridity research across the organizational, inter‐organizational, and societal levels of analysis. We introduce a framework of transformational hybridity based on three interlinked mechanisms that drive societal transformation across different levels –Shape up!,Shake up!, andShift up! Shape up!involves changes in organizational and inter‐organizational hybridity practices. In turn,Shake up!involves changes in hybridity boundaries through organizational and inter‐organizational arrangements. Through interplay, these two mechanisms may bring aboutShift up!, a societal transformation that addresses a grand challenge. Taken together, this Special Issue paves the road for novel research directions and equips scholars and practitioners alike with a multi‐level lens for tackling societal grand challenges through transformational hybridity.</content>

    <title>Rethinking Interpersonal Humour in Organizations: Clarifying Constructs and Charting A Path Forward</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizational humour research is accelerating; however, scholars seem to disagree on how to conceptualize and operationalize interpersonal humour. A widely used approach draws from personality psychology and conceptualizes humour as a typology of four styles. This “humour styles” approach possesses conceptual shortcomings and introduces important questions about construct validity. Specifically, the humour styles tend to conflate inferred motives and outcomes within the definition of each style, raising concerns about circularity and tautology. Moreover, its typological foundation – originally developed for an intrapersonal context – becomes less tenable when applied interpersonally. To support the progression of humour scholarship, we begin by clarifying the core construct of humour, which serves as the basis for a broader conceptual critique of the humour styles approach. This critique is then illustrated through a multi‐study research program (N = 1086; six samples). We conclude by proposing the MOHM model (Model of Organizational Humour Motives) as a conceptually grounded alternative to guide future research on interpersonal humour. This research contributes to humour scholarship by clarifying the core humour concept, critiquing a popular approach (which is reducing construct clarity), and offering a forward‐looking framework to inspire more precise and impactful research on humour in organizational settings.</content>

Exploiting multiple firm‐bank relationships to fully account for all unobserved heterogeneity, we find that prohibiting interlocks decreased the interest rates of previously interlocked banks by 14 basis points relative to other banks. The effect is stronger for high‐quality firms and for loans extended by interlocked banks with a large joint market share. Interest rates on loans from previously interlocked banks become more dispersed. Finally, firms borrowing more from previously interlocked banks expand investment, employment, and sales.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effect of internal employee coordination on customer trust, focusing specifically on employees’ responsiveness to each other as an important, quantifiable, and objective aspect of internal coordination. Using proprietary data from a company with exogenous assignment of employees to teams that serve individual customers, we study how inter‐employee responsiveness influences customer trust. Each customer is served via an app‐based group chat by a randomly assigned team of employees. Our data include more than 2 million group chat messages with over 16 thousand customers. We find that inter‐employee responsiveness serves as a credible signal that helps build customer trust, as evidenced by their subsequent contracting choices. The effect is more pronounced when the signal is (1) more frequent and (2) more intense. Our findings highlight the novel value of internal employee responsiveness as a credible signal that helps build trust with external stakeholders.</content>

    <title>All That Glitters Is Not Gold: The Impact of Certification Test Costs in Online Labor Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our study examines how the value of skill certifications changes when an online labor platform eliminates testing fees. Although the policy led to a sharp increase in certification rates and faster hiring, it also reduced the signaling power of certifications. Employers became less likely to hire certified workers or offer them higher pay because their average performance declined. This drop in credibility disproportionately affected inexperienced workers who depended on certifications to establish trust. Importantly, we find that the negative effects of free certification can be reduced through better platform design. Showing more detailed certification information, such as test scores and how recently the certification was earned, helps employers interpret credentials more effectively. These design improvements can help preserve the value of certifications while expanding access.</content>

    <title>Forced to Change? Media Exposure of Labor Issues and Firm Artificial Intelligence Investment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are increasingly interested in investing in artificial intelligence (AI), but what drives this trend? Our research reveals that media coverage of labor issues plays a significant role. When firms face public scrutiny through media exposure of labor issues, the reputational pressure pushes them to act. AI emerges as a strategic response, offering powerful capabilities to automate and augment human tasks. Analyzing data from U.S. public firms, we found that labor issue-related media coverage significantly increases AI investments, particularly among firms with the motivation and resources to invest in AI, whereas other IT or general investments are not similarly influenced, suggesting that firms view AI as uniquely suitable to address labor challenges. Interestingly, firms appear to prioritize AI for its automation capabilities, particularly targeting high-skilled labor, contrasting with traditional automation investments focused on lower-skilled tasks. This shift signals a transformation in how companies are reimaging the future of work. For business leaders, our findings also reveal that AI investment not only reduces future media scrutiny but also decreases labor reliance. Policymakers, however, must consider the broader implications, particularly the impact of AI investment on labor markets and the need for proactive workforce planning.</content>

    <title>Do boards learn to hire? The effect of board experience with &lt;scp&gt;CEO&lt;/scp&gt; replacement on &lt;scp&gt;CEO&lt;/scp&gt; performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examined whether or not directors' prior experiences with Chief Executive Officer (CEO) selection helps them to choose a higher‐performing CEO. Using S&amp;P 1500 firms from 1999 to 2020, we found that boards' prior experiences with hiring CEOs do not improve their ability to choose a higher‐performing CEO; rather, their prior CEO selection experience has a small but consistent negative effect. At the same time, we found little evidence that the domain specificity of prior CEO succession experience impacts the performance of subsequently hired CEOs. Overall, we suggest that our pattern of results is suggestive of superstitious learning by directors.Managerial SummaryOur findings suggest that boards with more experience hiring new CEOs tend to select CEOs who exhibit slightly lower performance. This finding is an important addition to recent research in this area that theoretically and empirically demonstrates why and how boards may find it difficult to be effective. The economic magnitude of our findings is relatively small, however. It does not appear that more experience with hiring CEOs is associated with boards making dramatically worse CEO selections. Instead, the magnitude of our findings suggests that greater experience with hiring CEOs leads boards to select new CEOs who perform slightly worse and that this negative effect persists when we consider domain specificity (e.g., the context of prior hiring experience).</content>

    <title>Pricing Experimental Design: Causal Effect, Expected Revenue and Tail Risk</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When launching a new product, historical sales data are often not available, leaving price as a crucial experimental instrument for sellers to gauge market response. When designing pricing experiments, there are three fundamental objectives: estimating the causal effect of price (i.e., price elasticity), maximizing the expected revenue through the experiment, and controlling the tail risk that, if not controlled, may lead to significant financial losses. In this paper, we reveal the relationship among such three objectives. Under a linear structural model, we investigate the trade-offs between causal effect estimation and expected revenue maximization, as well as between expected revenue maximization and tail risk control. Furthermore, we propose an optimal pricing experimental design, which can flexibly adapt to different desired levels of trade-offs. Through the optimal design, we also explore the relationship between causal effect estimation and tail risk control. Moreover, we establish an always-valid confidence sequence and a central limit theorem for the inference of the causal effect. Finally, we extend our results and the design to a misspecified setting, where the structural model is not necessarily linear but the seller still runs our design for linear structural models. The results demonstrate the robustness of our design and the wide existence of the relationships among the three objectives.This paper was accepted by George Shanthikumar, data science.Funding: The authors thank the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)-IBM partnership in Artificial Intelligence and the MIT Data Science Laboratory for support.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03209 .</content>

    <title>Not Quite Shipshape: How Better Reputations Can Lead to Worse Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research suggests that firms with good reputations will work to protect them, as good reputations are assets that attract resources and facilitate market exchanges. But good reputations do not just attract resources and facilitate exchanges; they can also buffer firms from scrutiny. Therefore, this study asks whether organizations with good reputations will still perform well, even if they are less likely to be watched or held accountable for doing poorly. The study bounds its focus to a form of performance that depends on external oversight, in this case through the regulatory governance process. The theory suggests that higher regulatory reputations, as measured through increases in ratings, will lead to weaker monitoring – which, in turn, allows performance to decline in the regulated domain. An analysis of public health outcomes in the cruise travel industry provides support for these predictions. Tests of moderating hypotheses suggest that the direct effect of ratings on performance is stronger when regulators have more power over the organization, and when the organization is not already under scrutiny for poor performance on other ancillary dimensions.</content>

    <title>Desired and Feared Identities and Their Role in Occupational Identity Regulation</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper extends theory by showing how occupational identity regulation operates jointly through both desired and feared identities which, in combination, enforce normative control. Taking a narrative identity perspective and drawing on an ethnographic and interview‐based study of veterinarians, we make three principal contributions to our understanding of identity regulation. First, we explain how, in high surveillance contexts, occupational members construct not just positively valenced desired identities but also negatively valenced feared identities, and how feared identities are antagonistic foils to desired ones that enhance their appeal. Second, we analyse how self‐discipline is exerted through dual processes of self‐examination: prideful talk that affirms desired identities and guilt‐ridden talk which casts doubt on their attainment and spurs auto‐correction. Third, we demonstrate how conformist identity work which (re)produces occupational identities through desire and fear reduces people's scope for resistance. This research highlights identity work that is non‐supportive of the (desired) self and how an appreciation of feared in addition to desired identities is vital to understand fully the tensional nature of occupational selves.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a novel data set of realized syndicated loan cash flows and a risk‐adjustment methodology adapted from the private equity literature, I provide a measure of risk‐adjusted returns for bank loan cash flows. Banks, on average, generate 180 basis points in gross risk‐adjusted returns and add $75 million of value annually to their loan portfolios. Banks earn higher returns when they lend to financially constrained borrowers, and the risk‐adjusted performance of bank loan portfolios exhibits persistence. However, banks require higher risk‐adjusted returns when facing their own financing frictions, and shareholders earn nearly zero net risk‐adjusted returns once bank staff are compensated for their lending effort. Overall, these findings suggest that banks provide valuable services to mitigate borrowers' financing frictions, and the present value of loan cash flows pays for the costs of providing these services.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We build an arbitrage‐based model of the yield curves in a heterogeneous monetary union with sovereign default risk, which accounts for the asymmetric shifts in euro‐area yields during the Covid‐19 pandemic. We derive an affine term structure solution, and decompose yields into expectations, term premium, expected default loss, and credit risk premium components. In an extension, we endogenize the peripheral default probability, showing that it decreases with central bank bond holdings. Calibrating the model to Germany and Italy, we show that both the level and the shifts in the sovereign spread are mainly attributable to the credit risk premium.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Extant studies suggest that a particular set of means, once in place, prompt entrepreneurs to enact effectual decision‐making. However, little is known about how such effectual means are developed, particularly when entrepreneurs' primary means are digital capital rather than pre‐existing effectual means. To address this gap, our qualitative research examines an emerging phenomenon in which young people engage in side‐hustling through social media. Our findings reveal that entrepreneurs develop effectual means by leveraging digital capital through browsing, consulting, and imitating. This developmental process is significantly streamlined by digital capital's generativity, recommendability, and multimodality, with its cost‐effectiveness dynamically assessed to determine the continuity of development. Drawing on these findings, we discuss implications for effectuation theory and entrepreneurship studies.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs are known to rely on their established means for effectual decision‐making. However, little is known about how entrepreneurs make effectual decisions when they possess digital capital but have underdeveloped means for effectuation. This study explores how young side‐hustlers on social media build means for effectuation through browsing, consulting, and imitating. The generativity, recommendability, and multimodality of digital capital significantly enhance this developmental process, while cost‐effectiveness is continuously assessed to determine whether to proceed. We develop a process model that illustrates how entrepreneurs leverage and optimize digital capital to drive effectuation in the digital age.</content>

    <title>Integrating multimodal data and machine learning for entrepreneurship research</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Extant research in neuroscience suggests that human perception is multimodal in nature—we model the world integrating diverse data sources such as sound, images, taste, and smell. Working in a dynamic environment, entrepreneurs are expected to draw on multimodal inputs in their decision making. However, extant research in entrepreneurship has largely focused on how entrepreneurs or investors develop insights from data in a single mode. A few studies that have used a multimodal approach either simplify the multimodal data (MMD) into a few constructs or manually analyze the data without fully utilizing their potential. Such oversimplification limits the insights that can be gained from MMD. In this paper, we offer a framework to guide researchers to analyze and integrate MMD, capturing various cues embedded in the entrepreneurial process. We illustrate how applying machine learning algorithms to MMD can engender a robust, reliable, and scalable approach for researchers to effectively capture the elusive yet critical aspects of entrepreneurial phenomena. We also curate a set of data and algorithm resources for researchers interested in leveraging MMD in their studies.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs operate in fast‐paced and complex environments where success often relies on the ability to make sense of diverse and rich information, which ranges from explicit observations (e.g., what they see and hear) to more subtle contextual cues. Yet, most entrepreneurship research focuses on analyzing data in a single mode, such as only texts or numbers. Our research highlights the importance of embracing multimodal data (MMD) that combines various formats like audio, image, video, and text, to better understand and explain entrepreneurial decision‐making. We introduce a practical framework and a set of machine learning techniques that help managers and researchers alike harness the richness of multimodal data. Rather than simplifying or manually analyzing multimodal data, our approach allows for scalable, systematic, and reliable insights into the entrepreneurial process. For practitioners, this means better tools for evaluating pitches, tracking team dynamics, or sensing market trends in real time. To support adoption, we also provide a curated set ofMMDsources and algorithms that organizations can leverage to make more informed strategic decisions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study the impact of industrial policies on industrial development by considering an important episode during the East Asian miracle: South Korea’s heavy and chemical industry (HCI) drive, 1973–1979. Based on newly assembled data, I use the introduction and termination of industrial policies to study their impacts during and after the intervention period. (1) I reveal that heavy-chemical industrial policies promoted the expansion and dynamic comparative advantage of directly targeted industries. (2) Using variation in exposure to policies through the input-output network, I demonstrate that the policy indirectly benefited downstream users of targeted intermediates. (3) The benefits of HCI persisted even after the policy ended, as some results were slower to appear. The findings suggest that the temporary drive shifted Korean manufacturing into more advanced markets and supported durable change. This study helps clarify the lessons drawn from the East Asian growth miracle.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of an innovative police patrol program on sexual harassment in public spaces in Hyderabad, India. In collaboration with the Hyderabad City Police, we randomize exposure to police patrols and the visibility of officers by deploying both uniformed and undercover officers across 350 hotspots. To assess the effect, we implement a novel, high-frequency observation exercise to measure sexual harassment at these hotspots, where enumerators recorded all observed instances of sexual harassment and women’s responses in real time. We find that although police patrols had no impact on overall street harassment, uniformed police patrols reduced severe forms of harassment (forceful touching, intimidation) by 27 percent and reduced the likelihood of women leaving the hotspot due to sexual harassment. We uncovered the underlying mechanisms and found that both police visibility and officers’ attitudes toward sexual harassment are key to understanding its incidence.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how an increase in bank lending affects firms’ investment disclosures and policies. Exploiting the unconventional liquidity injections by the European Central Bank in 2011–2012, we find that U.S. borrowers of European Union (EU) banks receive greater bank financing and issue more management capital expenditure (capex) forecasts following the liquidity injections. In contrast, we find no evidence of changes in bond financing or issuance of management earnings forecasts. We also find that EU banks’ U.S. borrowers on average receive negative market reactions to their capex forecasts and make no change in investment following the liquidity injection. Further, relative to firms with positive feedback, firms with negative feedback have a lower increase in investment but a higher increase in financial assets. Additionally, we find that the effect of increased bank lending on management capex forecasts is more pronounced among banks with weaker financial conditions and among borrowers with greater financial constraints, higher growth volatility, and more informed trading. These findings highlight the important role of capex forecasts in seeking market feedback following increased bank lending and suggest that market feedback helps explain why the transmission of bank credit to corporate investment did not occur following the liquidity injections.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00528 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In view of the significant role project success plays for all parties in the crowdfunding market, a wealth of research has extensively explored its vastly diverse antecedents. Drawing on the elaboration likelihood model as an overarching theoretical basis, our meta-analysis examines the aggregated effects of widely investigated antecedents (as central and peripheral cues) and moderating roles of research contexts (referring to the elaboration likelihood). It reveals a stronger link with soft information–related factors, weaker ties with backer-related factors, and varied effects of project factors. Crowdfunding success measure, crowdfunding model, platform popularity, and project location are important reasons for the inconsistencies in findings across individual studies. Our research offers valuable insights for stakeholders in the crowdfunding ecosystem. For backers, it empowers them to select projects with greater potential for success among the vast number of available options, ensuring more informed investment decisions. Fundraisers can leverage our findings to refine their fundraising strategies, thereby boosting their chances of securing funds effectively. Crowdfunding platforms can harness our findings to refine their system architecture, enrich service offerings, and improve user satisfaction. Furthermore, regulators and policymakers can draw from our study to devise regulations that nurture a robust and favorable crowdfunding environment.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a continuous-time general equilibrium model with intermediaries at the heart of international financial markets. Global intermediaries bargain with households and extract rents from providing access to foreign claims. By tilting state prices, intermediaries’ market power breaks monetary neutrality and makes international risk-sharing inefficient. Despite having zero net positions, markups charged by intermediaries significantly distort international asset prices, affecting exchange rate dynamics and their response to shocks. Our model can reproduce patterns consistent with several well-known exchange rate puzzles, such as deviations from uncovered and covered interest parity. All equilibrium quantities are derived in closed form, allowing us to pin down the underlying economic mechanisms explicitly. (JEL E44, E52, F31, F33, G13, G15, G23)</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Information Sharing and Contracting between Competing Manufacturers and Common Retailer</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study information sharing contracts in which a privately informed retailer offers to share its demand information with the upstream competing manufacturers (suppliers) for a price. We investigate whether such information sharing contracts would ever be accepted by the manufacturers, especially when they can use alternative means, like screening contracts, to obtain the same information. For that we model a 3-stage game between the retailer and the manufacturers in which the retailer first determines the optimal payment, per manufacturer, for sharing its demand information. Consequently, the manufacturers simultaneously accept or reject this offer in stage 2. In stage 3, both manufacturers simultaneously offer menus of payment-quantity contracts to the retailer, which act as screening contracts if the manufacturer(s) rejected information sharing contract previously. We fully characterize stage-3 contracts under common agency; the manufacturers’ stage-2 equilibrium; and the retailer’s stage-1 decision. We find that common agency can augment the reduction in competition intensity between the manufacturers. As a result, a manufacturer using screening can do better than a manufacturer accepting information-sharing even when information is free, which implies that both manufacturers might never choose information sharing in a pure strategy equilibrium for a positive information sharing price. Despite this, we find that the retailer will optimally set an information sharing price that results in both manufacturers either accepting information sharing as long as demand uncertainty is not too low, or always accepting information sharing, and that the manufacturers can end up in a prisoner’s dilemma. Managerially, our findings provide guidance to both manufacturers as well as retailers on their decisions pertaining to information sharing contracts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In "Robust Actionable Prescriptive Analytics," Chen et al. present a significant advancement in prescriptive analytics. The authors propose a novel robust prescriptive analytics framework that bridges data-driven decision making and actionable policy optimization. Unlike traditional approaches that follow a “predict, then optimize” methodology, this framework directly maps side information to optimized decisions, ensuring both interpretability and implementability. Leveraging a robust satisficing approach, the model effectively mitigates overfitting to empirical data while maintaining computational tractability. The authors also introduce tree-based static and affine policies for enhanced interpretability, and they demonstrate the framework’s practical value through a portfolio optimization case study. This innovative approach provides a powerful tool for decision makers seeking robust, data-driven policies across various operational contexts.</content>

    <title>Incentives, Framing, and Reliance on Algorithmic Advice: An Experimental Study</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managerial decision makers are increasingly supported by advanced data analytics and other artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies, but they are often found to be hesitant to follow the algorithmic advice. We examine how compensation contract design and framing of an AI algorithm influence decision makers’ reliance on algorithmic advice and performance in a price estimation task. Based on a large sample of almost 1,500 participants, we find that compared with a fixed compensation, both compensation contracts based on individual performance and tournament contracts lead to an increase in effort duration and to more reliance on algorithmic advice. We further find that using an AI algorithm that is framed as also incorporating human expertise has positive effects on advice utilization, especially for decision makers with fixed pay contracts. By showing how widely used control practices, such as incentives and task framing, influence the interaction of human decision makers with AI algorithms, our findings have direct implications for managerial practice.This paper has been accepted by David Simchi-Levi for the Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02777 .</content>

    <title>Discrete Choice via Sequential Search</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Essentially every choice involves an information collection or search phase prior to a decision-making phase that culminates in a choice. To study the information collection phase within an important class of search problems and understand how it influences the final choice, we embed an analytically tractable discrete choice model in a classical model of sequential search with perfect recall. Although significant progress has been made in the theory literature in analyzing consumers’ discrete choice behavior using random utility models, discrete choice through a sequential search process has not received enough attention at least in part because of analytical intractability issues. We build on the seminal Pandora’s Problem as a model of sequential search with perfect recall and on Exponomial Choice as a model of discrete choice (with each choice specified by a deterministic or observable utility component minus a random or unobservable utility component following an exponential distribution). We derive the search path and final choice probabilities in closed form, develop all the analytical tools to optimize prices for a given assortment of products, and show that the optimal assortment must contain some number of highest-value products at optimal prices. These results enable joint optimization of assortment and prices efficiently. The structure of the solution features a distinct group of products that are priced just so they remain on the search path with higher probability. Through simulation studies, allowing us to control the ground truth, we also show that our model is competitive against the state of the art in empirical modeling of sequential search and that ignoring sequential search distorts both optimal variety and pricing decisions in an upward direction.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01552 .</content>

    <title>How the Design of Ranking Systems and Ability Affect Physician Effort</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although relative performance feedback in the form of rankings appears to be effective in improving health outcomes, it may have either motivating or demotivating effects for individual physicians. Potential factors influencing such effects include a physician’s ability and the design of the ranking system itself; however, there is limited understanding of these factors. Using a controlled lab-in-the-field experiment with practicing and future physicians as subjects ([Formula: see text]), we systematically analyze effort within small teams under different ranking systems. Exogenously varying the number and position of the thresholds defining the ranking system, we observe that the addition of a threshold to create a new rank is motivating—that is, increases effort—only among individuals capable of exceeding that threshold; the effort of other individuals may remain unchanged or even decrease. In particular, a highly granular ranking system with ranks spanning the entire range of possible outcomes maximizes overall physician effort; high thresholds serve to motivate high-ability individuals, whereas moderate and low thresholds provide opportunities for improvement to lower-ability individuals who cannot reach the high thresholds. Our results suggest that, to motivate their teams effectively, clinical leaders should provide rank feedback using a system under which physicians of all ability types can improve their rank through increased effort.This paper was accepted by Stefan Scholtes, healthcare management.Funding: This work was supported by C-SEB Center for Social and Economic Behavior at the University of Cologne (Junior Startup Grant No: Rd04-2016-JSUG-Huesmann) and the School of Business and Economics at the University of Münster (Junior Researcher Promotion Fund).

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Policy shocks that increase the costs of public goods should simultaneously reduce voter support for them. We study the extent to which this creates a corresponding voter-induced municipal credit risk. We exploit changes to state and local tax (SALT) deductions from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act as a policy shock to the costs of local public goods. In a difference-in-differences framework with repeated bond trades, we find that jurisdictions with a higher share of residents who ceased deducting SALT (and therefore, face a higher marginal cost of local public goods) experienced a significant increase in municipal bond yields, with an average treatment effect of 8.3 basis points or 3.0% of the unconditional average yield spread. This effect is concentrated in areas where residents have a direct impact on municipal financing decisions via ballot initiatives. This study thus demonstrates the importance of voters in the pricing of public debt and extends the discussion of political and policy uncertainty and therefore, coordination and agency problems to the municipal context.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06072 .</content>

    <title>Climate Change and Mutual Fund Voting on Climate Proposals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores whether investors’ personal experience with climate change affects their voting behavior on climate change–related proposals. We find that fund managers exposed to abnormally hot temperatures are significantly more likely to support climate proposals. We further show that the effect is persistent. We observe significant heterogeneity in the effect of hot temperatures, depending on firm-level climate risk, the quality of the proposals, fund investment strategy, and prior awareness of climate change. Fund managers’ personal experience with climate change matters for the outcome of climate proposals as it affects the aggregate support they receive. Fund managers exposed to abnormally hot temperatures are also more likely to divest from stocks with greater exposure to climate change.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: R.

    <title>EXPRESS: How Can a Firm Suppress Shareholders’ Punitive Reaction to Its Disengagement from a Geopolitically Uncertain Market?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Increased geopolitical tensions have raised firms’ uncertainty about some geographical markets; in response, firms may announce their disengagement from these markets. Such announcements may lower the firm’s future revenue and thus elicit negative reactions from shareholders. The authors theorize managers can frame announcements to impress shareholders and suppress their punitive reactions. Specifically, in the context of firms’ announcements of disengagement from Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, the authors show that an announcement’s market emphasis (i.e., mentions of product-market activities and stakeholders) is positively related to the shareholders’ reaction. Further, the announcement’s social emphasis (i.e., mentions of employees, environment, and community) and a delay in announcing the disengagement weakens the market emphasis’s positive association with shareholder reactions. This research highlights that linguistic framing in disengagement announcements can shape shareholders’ reactions to such announcements.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The global food system has a large impact on the environment. By converting household grocery purchases into environmental cost factors like greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use, this study examines the sustainability of food purchases over a 10-year period using household panel data in two pro-sustainability markets (Germany and the Netherlands). The environmental intensity of households’ grocery baskets has not declined over time in these countries. Even though younger and more educated households are starting to shift their diets, the share of plant-based alternatives in food diets remains very low. The authors propose that one contributing factor is a lack of environmental knowledge, which they address by developing an app that gives personalized feedback on the emissions associated with consumers’ food purchases. The app also allows users to create sustainable grocery bundles aligned with their dietary preferences. Two experiments demonstrate that interacting with the app (1) raises subjective and objective environmental knowledge related to food, with much of this improvement persisting for over six months, and (2) reduces GHG emissions associated with stated food choices by up to 33%. These reductions are driven by different information formats within the app, including peer-comparisons and detailed information about food-category emissions.</content>

    <title>The Strength of Showing Weakness: Organizational Supplication and Investor Reactions to Workforce Downsizing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Strategy research usually assumes that displays of weakness are disadvantageous for firms. In this study, we challenge this assumption. We propose that deliberate displays of weakness can help firms preserve stakeholder approval when taking controversial decisions. To test this proposition, we examine the use and effectiveness of organizational supplication in the context of workforce downsizing. Building on impression management theory, we predict that firms portray themselves as weak through downward earnings management before workforce downsizing announcements, and that this supplication tactic helps attenuate investors’ negative reactions. Moreover, we posit that supplication paired with an efficiency-focused verbal justification for the downsizing is particularly effective at attenuating negative investor reactions to downsizing announcements, as an additional verbal justification lends authenticity to the downsizing firm’s supplication attempt. Yet, we also theorize that organizational supplication through downward earnings management is less effective if positive firm evaluations by security analysts and the business media make it appear inauthentic. The empirical analysis of nearly 600 workforce downsizing announcements by the largest listed U.S. firms between 2001 and 2020 supports our theoretical predictions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Privatization of state‐owned enterprises is on the agenda across the globe. Using Swedish data covering two decades, we show that productivity gains and headcount reductions are associated with economic costs for incumbent workers. Workers experience income losses and higher unemployment, but half of the losses are covered by the social safety net. We also find small positive effects on entrepreneurship and cash holdings but no meaningful effects on other labor market, family, health, or household finance outcomes. Productivity improves when the CEO is replaced, and the gains outweigh workers' income declines by a factor of between two and six.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over‐the‐counter (OTC) trading thrives despite competition from exchanges. We let OTC dealers cream skim from exchanges in an otherwise standard Glosten and Milgrom framework. Restricting the dealer's ability to cream skim induces “cheap substitution”: some traders exit while others with larger gains from trade enter. Cheap substitution implies trading costs, trade volumes, and market shares are poor policy indicators. In a benchmark case, restricting the dealer raises welfare only if trading cost increases, volume falls, and OTC market share is high. By contrast, the restriction improves welfare when adverse selection risk is low. A simple procedure implements the optimal Pigouvian tax.</content>

    <title>Advancing Next-Generation Multimethod Research in Information Systems: A Framework and Some Recommendations for Authors and Evaluators</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The increasing complexity of sociotechnical phenomena, proliferation of diverse data sources, expanding repertoire of research methods, and broadening multiparadigmatic awareness and competence have spurred a growing interest in multimethod research in the information systems (IS) field. This editorial recognizes and celebrates the value of integrating diverse methods and offers a framework to classify multimethod research using two dimensions: (a) methodological distance—the degree of difference (proximate or distant) between methods employed in terms of characteristics such as paradigmatic assumptions, techniques, and goals; and (b) nature of integration—the extent to which the methods are combined in loosely coupled (interlayered) or tightly coupled (intertwined) ways. These dimensions yield four types of multimethod research: assembly (proximate methods with interlayered integration), blend (proximate methods with intertwined integration), bridge (distant methods with interlayered integration), and fusion (distant methods with intertwined integration). We illustrate each archetype with studies published in leading IS journals. Building on these examples, we provide actionable guidance for authors on conducting and presenting multimethod research and also offer recommendations for evaluators of multimethod work. More broadly, we call on the IS community to embrace multimethod research not as an ad hoc stack of methods, but as a systematic strategy, aligning with these recommendations related to methodological distance and nature of integration, to produce a credible, revelatory, and rich body of knowledge on multifaceted IS phenomena.</content>

    <title>Employee Digital Transformation Experience Towards Automation Versus Augmentation: Implications for Job Attitudes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As a growing number of organizations are leveraging emerging technologies to optimize their operations to stay competitive, digital transformation has fast become an integral part of employee experience at the intersection of their psychological states and the workplace. However, employee experience with digital transformation is heterogeneous given the different approaches organizations take toward this initiative. We hence simultaneously consider both the nature of the digital transformation (i.e., automation versus augmentation) and the presence versus absence of employee voice mechanisms. Drawing from psychological reactance theory, we argue that employee experience of automation‐driven transformation will be more likely to engender psychological reactance, which in turn impacts important employee job attitudes, represented by job satisfaction, employment security, and turnover intention. We also argue that employee voice moderates this mediated relationship. Using data from two studies with different samples and research designs (an experimental design in Study 1 and a field survey in Study 2), the findings support our hypothesized relationships. The two‐study approach helps to enhance the validity of the research and demonstrate the generalizability of findings, thereby strengthening our contributions to the literature. Overall, the studies theoretically extend understandings of how employees respond to digital transformation by offering new insights into the psychological reactance mechanism. We also provide practical implications for business and practitioners seeking to manage digital transformation in ways that enhance desired employee job attitudes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The emergence of sustainability discourse has provided new avenues and momentum for human resource management (HRM) scholars to extend existing lines of enquiry and to generate new ones. This has led to a surge of research interest in sustainability in the last decade, not least as a response to the growing environmental concerns and, more recently, to the Sustainable Development Goals launched by the United Nations in 2015. The rapidly emerging body of research is accompanied by confusion and critiques regarding what sustainable HRM entails, how it can be measured, and who may benefit. This perspective paper discusses these issues by focusing on common good HRM as the latest variant of sustainable HRM and identifies challenges as well as opportunities for research. It draws on stakeholder theory, legitimacy theory, cultural perspective, and HR ecosystem theory to illustrate how future studies can advance our knowledge of common good HRM by building on the existing strong body of HRM scholarship and embracing a broader range of stakeholders, epistemological perspectives, and methodological approaches.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper explores how the deep historical roots of informal institutions influence current informal businesses. It proposes that both pre‐colonial institutions—the tradition of cousin marriage—and the subsequent shocks of colonization still impact the performance of informal firms. We theorize on how the effects of historical family systems are moderated by the traumatic and spatially heterogeneous shocks of colonialism, in particular the cultural values of the colonizers (individualism) and their religious (missionary) activities. Our hypotheses are tested by regression analysis based on surveys of informal businesses in multiple regions of eight African countries. We find that the cousin marriage tradition is negatively associated with the performance of current informal businesses though this relationship is attenuated in places where colonizers were more individualistic.Managerial SummaryThis paper explores how the pre‐colonial family institutions—the tradition of cousin marriage—and the subsequent shocks of colonization jointly impact the performance of contemporary informal firms in sub‐Saharan Africa. We propose that the historical tradition of cousin marriage has persistent and negative effects on the revenue and labor productivity of contemporary informal businesses. This is because informal entrepreneurs in ethnic areas with the cousin marriage tradition may prioritize social obligations over economic incentives. However, these relationships are attenuated in ethnic areas colonized by European countries with more individualistic cultural values. Our findings highlight the importance for business owners and managers to understand the deep historical roots of the social norms of the communities and groups with which they interact.</content>

    <title>Rationing Scarce Healthcare Capacity: A Study of the Ventilator Allocation Guidelines During the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the United States, even though national guidelines for allocating scarce healthcare resources are lacking, 26 states have specific ventilator allocation guidelines to be invoked in case of a shortage. While several states developed their guidelines in response to the recent COVID‐19 pandemic, New York State developed these guidelines in 2015 as “pandemic influenza is a foreseeable threat, one that we cannot ignore.” The primary objective of this study is to assess the existing procedures and priority rules in place for allocating/rationing scarce ventilator capacity and propose alternative (and improved) priority schemes. We first build machine learning models using inpatient records of COVID‐19 patients admitted to New York‐Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center and an affiliated community health center to predict survival probabilities as well as ventilator length‐of‐use. Then, we use the resulting point estimators and their uncertainties as inputs for a multiclass priority queueing model with abandonments to assess three priority schemes: (i) SOFA‐P (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment based prioritization), which most closely mimics the existing practice by prioritizing patients with sufficiently low SOFA scores; (ii) ISP (incremental survival probability), which assigns priority based on patient‐level survival predictions; and (iii) ISP‐LU (incremental survival probability per length‐of‐use), which takes into account survival predictions and resource use duration. Our findings highlight that our proposed priority scheme, ISP‐LU, achieves a demonstrable improvement over the other two alternatives. Specifically, the expected number of survivals increasesanddeath risk while waiting for ventilator use decreases. We also show that ISP‐LU is a robust priority scheme whose implementation yields a Pareto‐improvement over both SOFA‐P and ISP in terms of maximizing saved lives after mechanical ventilation while limiting racial disparity in access to the priority queue.</content>

    <title>Impact of Self‐Service Technology in Designing a Service Delivery System</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Self‐service technologies (SSTs) have been widely adopted in industries that require the delivery of physical products by services, in which consumers evaluate a product for both the product value and the service value. A typical service delivery system usually involves sales agents and/or self‐service technologies, for example, online services and kiosks, to serve consumers by a coproduction process. In other words, both the sales agent (or self‐service machine) and the consumer should exert effort, with corresponding service costs. By modeling the coproduction output with a Cobb–Douglas production function, we establish a principal–agent model to study the value of self‐service technologies in designing a service delivery system wherein the sales agent's service cost is private information. We first characterize the main trade‐off between the sales agent and the self‐service machine when the firm provides only one service channel. Then, we analyze the value of the self‐service machine when the firm can provide both service channels. We find that, interestingly, the firm may possibly provide both service channels, that is, services offered by the sales agent and the self‐service machine, when the level of information uncertainty is high, and the self‐service machine's service cost is intermediate. Moreover, when both service channels are offered, only the efficient sales agent will be contracted, and the inefficient sales agents are screened out of the market by the self‐service machine; that is, the self‐service machine can help the firm eliminate the information rent. We also investigate how the firm's service weight in the coproduction process and information uncertainty influence the consumer surplus, firm's choices, contract parameters, and resulting profits. Our results are shown to be robust when our model is extended to consider a single‐contract strategy, contracting on effort, a continuous sales agent type, and a general coproduction function.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a class of online decision-making problems with exchangeable actions, where in each period a controller is presented an input type drawn from some stochastic arrival process. The controller must choose an action, and the final objective depends only on the aggregate type-action counts. Such a framework encapsulates many online stochastic variants of common optimization problems with knapsack, bin packing, and generalized assignment as canonical examples. In such settings, we study a natural model-predictive control algorithm. We introduce general conditions under which this algorithm obtains uniform additive loss (independent of the horizon) compared with an optimal solution with full knowledge of arrivals. Our condition builds on the recently introduced compensated coupling technique, providing a unified view of how uniform additive loss arises as a consequence of the geometry of the underlying decision-making problem. Our characterization allows us to derive uniform loss algorithms for several new settings, including the first such algorithm for online stochastic bin packing. It also lets us study the effect of other modeling assumptions, including choice of horizon, batched decisions, and limited computation. In particular, we show that our condition is fulfilled by the above-mentioned problems when the end of the time horizon is known sufficiently long before the end. In contrast, if at a late stage, there is still uncertainty about the end of the time horizon we show that such uniform loss guarantees are impossible to achieve. We use real and synthetic data to illustrate our findings.This paper was accepted by J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although the significance of narrative thinking has been increasingly recognized by social scientists, very little empirical research has documented its consequences for economically significant outcomes. The current paper addresses this gap in one important domain: valuations. In three experiments, participants were given the opportunity to sell an item they owned (mug in Study 1, hat in Studies 2 and 3) using an incentive-compatible procedure (multiple price list). Prior to making selling decisions, participants were randomly assigned to either a narrative treatment, in which they were asked to tell the story of their item, or a list treatment, in which they were asked to list the characteristics of their item. The narrative treatment led to significantly higher selling prices and increased rates of participants refusing all offered prices. We further explore potential mechanisms, and the impact of different types of narratives, by analyzing self-reported classifications of, and employing natural language processing techniques on, participants’ narratives.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: Funding for the studies came from Loewenstein’s personal research fund provided by Carnegie Mellon University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01076 .</content>

    <title>Credit Market Frictions and the Linkage Between Dispersion and Macro Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cross-sectional dispersion and macro uncertainty (volatility of aggregate economic variables) are conceptually distinct. However, empirically, they both comove and are countercyclical. This paper builds a general equilibrium model and demonstrates that credit market frictions allow cross-sectional dispersion to drive time-varying macro uncertainty endogenously. In the model, as firm-level productivity becomes more dispersed, more firms are pushed to the left tail of the productivity distribution, resulting in more defaults and a depletion in aggregate net worth. This mechanism generates countercyclical leverage and aggregate volatility. The model implies that the government can inject equity in economic downturns to stabilize aggregate volatility.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00166 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study the impact of the world’s largest publicly funded health insurance plan for the poor on credit markets. India launched a health insurance plan that covered 500 million beneficiaries. The fact that opposition-ruled states did not implement the program for political reasons allows me to compare border districts of implemented and nonimplemented states within a difference-in-differences framework. I find that loan delinquency reduced significantly in implemented districts. Increased liquidity for loan repayment seems to be the mechanism at work. I rule out the federal-level ruling party’s influence as an explanation.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01039 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The racial disparity in mortgage approval rates decreases by four percentage points as a result of hedge fund activism targeting banks. Target banks experience a higher turnover of mortgage officers and open new bank branches in areas with greater racial disparities in mortgage approval rates. We show that the results are driven by hedge fund activists’ efforts to increase profitability and comply with the community reinvestment act. Our results suggest that hedge funds’ incentives to maximize shareholder value do not necessarily lead to a negative impact on other stakeholders.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Funding: This work is financially supported by the Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC Grant Number 72233003] and the General Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC Grant Number 72372517].Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03452 .</content>

    <title>Endogenous Merger Decisions Among Competitors: Impact of Limited Capacity and Loyal Segments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study endogenous merger decisions among three competing firms with asymmetric capacity: one large firm has ample capacity, and two small firms have limited capacity. Each firm can either operate independently or merge with another firm. Because of antitrust laws, all three firms merging is not permitted. When two firms merge, the merged entity and the remaining independent firm use the resulting capacity to capture their own “loyal buyers” and compete in price for price-sensitive “disloyal switchers.” We first consider a base model in which the size of loyal buyers for different firms is symmetric. We find that, in equilibrium, either there is no merger or the large firm will merge with a small firm as a “mixed merger.” We explain how this equilibrium structure is driven by the mergers’ impacts on market competition and firms’ pricing aggressiveness. Specifically, the mixed merger that can most effectively reduce price competition is the equilibrium under relatively competitive market conditions (i.e., the size of loyal buyers is small and capacity is large but limited). We also extend to the case with asymmetric size of loyal segments and show that two small firms merging (“small merger” structure) can be the equilibrium structure when the large firm has a much larger loyal segment than the small firms and the small firms’ capacity is sufficiently large. The impacts of mergers on social welfare and consumer surplus provide practical implications from the antitrust perspective. The antitrust agencies can approve a mixed merger to improve social welfare under certain conditions, but if the agencies pay more attention to consumer surplus, then mixed mergers should not be permitted. Small mergers, though sometimes not the equilibrium structures, can improve social welfare and consumer surplus. In such cases, the government can appropriately promote mergers that are beneficial for society and/or consumers by adopting some restrictive measures or offering incentives.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: The work of D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The underrepresentation of women in traditionally male-dominated fields of study can generate a lack of role models for female students, influencing their career choices. We investigate whether having higher shares of female professors and classmates throughout undergraduate studies in economics affects female students’ labor market outcomes up to five years after graduation. To deal with self-selection into professors and peers, we exploit the assignment rule of students to course sections at the prestigious University of Sao Paulo and focus on mandatory courses. Our findings suggest that having more female peers and professors can positively impact female students’ labor outcomes by increasing their participation rates in the workforce and accumulated experience, particularly in course sections in which female students are underrepresented. We also investigate potential channels driving our results. We show that a higher share of female classmates can help female students stay attached to the job market early on by securing internships or formal work during university. Moreover, female students are more likely to choose higher paying and male-dominated occupations if they have access to more female peers. Overall, our study highlights the importance of gender diversity in male-dominated academic settings and its potential positive impact on female students’ career outcomes.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo [Grants 2015/21640-3, 2017/23593-8, 2019/07424-7, 2019/25033-5, 2021/08880-6], Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, and Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES - Finance Code 001).Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01422 .</content>

    <title>Do Consumers Respond to Social Movements? Evidence from Gender-Stereotypical Purchases After #MeToo</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores whether and how consumers respond to global social movements challenging systemic discrimination and stereotypes. We examine the impact of the #MeToo movement on the market for products with stereotypical markers of femininity. Our analysis of high-frequency stockout and price data from a leading global fashion retailer spans from January 2017 to December 2018 and covers 32 countries, or 89% of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) population. Using a triple-difference approach across time, countries, and products, we identify changes in product-level stockouts, corresponding to a drop in the purchase of stereotypically “feminine” items. Our findings suggest a sudden shift in demand, with no immediate adjustments in product assortments or pricing. We discuss potential driving mechanisms, as well as implications for product management and marketing in marketplaces where segmentation is gender based.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02352 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do individuals process nondiagnostic information? According to Bayes’ theorem, signals that do not carry relevant information are treated as if no signal occurred. This paper provides evidence that individuals update their expectations even after observing uninformative signals. Importantly, the direction in which they update depends on the valence of the signal. Prior beliefs become more optimistic after desirable uninformative signals and more pessimistic after undesirable uninformative signals. Our results provide novel insights why individuals form and entertain false beliefs in environments in which potentially new information is easily accessible but costly to verify (e.g., online media).This paper was accepted by George Wu, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03367 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We construct a comprehensive data set of medium- and large-sized industrial firms and research universities in China and examine how Chinese firms’ commercialization of their technologies is related to their experience in industry-university collaboration (IUC). We propose that firms’ IUC experience constitutes an inimitable complementary asset that facilitates their technology commercialization. Our empirical analyses show that firms generate more new product sales and produce more product-oriented patents when they have more patents that are coassigned to universities or when they have more academic publications coauthored with university staff in the past. Such a relation is strengthened when firms have higher absorptive capacity, when firms are in industries that depend more on basic science, and when firms are located closer to their collaborating universities. Additional tests point out four channels through which firms’ IUC experience benefits their technology commercialization: knowledge acquisition, talent recruiting, direct technology transfers, and technological complementarity.This paper was accepted by Sridhar Tayur, entrepreneurship and innovation.Funding: D.

    <title>Kinks as Goals: Accelerating Commissions and the Performance of Sales Teams</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Piecewise-linear reward schemes are very common in workplaces; by definition, they divide the set of possible performance levels into disjoint intervals that could have psychological value to workers. When these schemes take the form of lump-sum bonuses, any psychological rewards associated with attaining a performance interval are hard to distinguish from material ones because both material and psychological incentives predict bunching at the output needed to earn the bonus. To disentangle these effects, this paper studies a common but understudied class of piecewise-linear pay—accelerators—in which the mechanisms’ predictions conflict. Using the distributions of daily sales in 103 small retail teams, we find that daily sales bunch at accelerators, which is inconsistent with models in which only material rewards matter. Combining simple theoretical models, institutional evidence, and heterogeneity analyses, we argue that this unexpected bunching results from teams’ decisions to use the convenient, salient kink points as shared goals, which yield symbolic utility to their members when the points are attained.This paper was accepted by Lamar Pierce, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01661 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Alternative data have become a new source of information for investors. This paper examines how this development is reshaping the role of sell-side analysts. Employing textual analysis of analysts’ written reports, we show that analysts themselves have begun to adopt alternative data in their analyses. Furthermore, we find that when analysts report drawing from alternative data they generate more accurate earnings forecasts, and their brokerages subsequently receive higher amounts in trading commissions from investors, suggesting that investors value the adoption of alternative data by analysts.This paper was accepted by Kay Gieseke, finance.Funding: This research is supported by NTU-Singapore under its startup grant program.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02659 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We empirically examine the consequences of the introduction of a cap-and-trade program in California, showing that although the program helped reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it had the unintended consequence of increasing toxic emissions from treated facilities, as facilities cut back on their waste-treatment efforts to reduce GHG emissions. We further show that this effect was weaker for more harmful toxins, for facilities that had invested in reducing toxic waste at source, and for those that were subject to close scrutiny from regulators, consistent with it being the result of strategic firm actions.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: I gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Singapore Green Finance Centre to enable the dissemination of this research’s findings.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03560 .</content>

    <title>Learning the Minimal Representation of a Continuous State-Space Markov Decision Process from Transition Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a framework for learning the most concise Markov decision process (MDP) model of a continuous state-space dynamic system from observed transition data. This setting is encountered in numerous important applications, such as patient treatment, online advertising, recommender systems, and estimation of treatment effects in econometrics. Most existing methods in offline reinforcement learning construct functional approximations of the value or the transition and reward functions, requiring complex and often not interpretable function approximators. Our approach instead relies on partitioning the system’s observation space into regions constituting states of a finite MDP representing the system. We discuss the theoretically minimal MDP representation that preserves the values and, therefore, the optimal policy of the dynamic system—in a sense, the optimal discretization. We formally define the problem of learning such a concise representation from transition data without exploration. Learning such a representation allows for enhanced tractability and, importantly, provides interpretability. To solve this problem, we introduce an in-sample property on partitions of the observation space we name coherence, and we show that if the class of possible partitions is of finite Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, any coherent partition with the transition data converges to the minimal representation of the system with provable finite-sample probably approximately correct convergence guarantees. This insight motivates our minimal representation learning algorithm that constructs from transition data an MDP representation that approximates the minimal representation of the system. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through numerical experiments in both deterministic and stochastic environments as well as with real data.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: The authors are very grateful to the Health Systems Initiative at MIT Sloan for financial support for this project.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01652 .</content>

    <title>Multi-armed Bandit Experimental Design: Online Decision-Making and Adaptive Inference</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Multi-armed bandit has been well known for its efficiency in online decision-making in terms of minimizing the loss of the participants’ welfare during experiments (i.e., the regret). In clinical trials and many other scenarios, the statistical power of inferring the treatment effects (i.e., the gaps between the mean outcomes of different arms) is also crucial. Nevertheless, minimizing the regret entails harming the statistical power of estimating the treatment effect because the observations from some arms can be limited. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between efficiency and statistical power by casting the multi-armed bandit experimental design into a minimax multi-objective optimization problem. We introduce the concept of Pareto optimality to mathematically characterize the situation in which neither the statistical power nor the efficiency can be improved without degrading the other. We derive a useful sufficient and necessary condition for the Pareto optimal solutions to the minimax multi-objective optimization problem. Additionally, we design an effective Pareto optimal multi-armed bandit experiment that can be tailored to different levels of the trade-off between the two objectives. Moreover, we extend the design and analysis to the setting where the outcome of each arm consists of an adversarial baseline reward and a stochastic treatment effect, demonstrating the robustness of our design. Finally, motivated by clinical trials, we examine the setting where the employed experiment must split the experimental units into a small number of batches, and we propose a flexible Pareto optimal design.This paper was accepted by George Shanthikumar, data science.Funding: The authors thank the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)-IBM partnership in Artificial Intelligence and the MIT Data Science Laboratory for support.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00492 .</content>

    <title>Local Agglomeration and Household Mortgage Debt</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using detailed household data, we find that households working in locally agglomerated economies have high mortgage loans and are more likely to have mortgage loans. Channel testing shows that local agglomeration increases housing and mortgage demand as well as mortgage supply. The increase in mortgage loans is driven by purchases of larger houses and smaller down payments. Mechanism analyses document that local agglomeration affects mortgage loans by increasing career upward potential and providing downside protection. Specifically, we find that the impact of local agglomeration is stronger for skilled employees with enhanced prospects. In addition, local agglomeration weakens the negative relation between unemployment and mortgage loans, which supports the downside-protection role of local agglomeration. These results hold under instrumental variables analysis, difference-in-difference analysis, and a set of robustness checks. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of local labor market composition in household mortgage debt.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: F. F.

    <title>Promotional Press Releases and Investor Processing Costs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Press releases are a primary disclosure channel firms use to communicate with investors. However, firms can also use press releases to self-promote to improve their public image. Promotional press releases are, on average, significantly less value relevant than those focused toward investors. They also contain more positive and emotional language as well as less specific and financially oriented language. Based on theories of disclosure processing costs and investor attention, we predict and find that firms’ recent high usage of this disclosure channel to self-promote is associated with increased investor attention and more efficient reactions to subsequent investor-focused disclosures. This effect is concentrated in less visible firms, whereas promotional press releases appear to have no effect on the pricing efficiency of more visible firms. We also provide evidence consistent with media attention being one channel through which these effects operate. Our findings deepen our understanding of how firms use press releases as a disclosure channel and contribute to the literature on disclosure processing costs.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by resources at the Arkansas High Performance Computing Center.

Management Sci. 68(8):6235–6249] presents experimental evidence showing that people have an intrinsic preference for diversification that is driven by risk aversion and loss aversion, with risk-averse and loss-averse individuals being more willing to pay for diversification. We document numerous discrepancies between the results reported in the paper and the results calculated from the experimental data. In particular, the data show that risk-averse individuals are actually less willing to pay for diversification, whereas the effect of loss aversion is nonmonotonic and not statistically significant. We thus show that the data do not support the paper’s claim of a preference for diversification driven by risk aversion and loss aversion.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Funding: The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the OP Group Research Foundation [Grants 20220057 and 20220089].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01581 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 established a new program called Opportunity Zones (OZs) that reduces or eliminates capital gains taxes on investment in a limited number of low-income Census tracts. We provide a model illustrating how a change in capital taxation affects employment in existing and new establishments. We then use establishment-level data to show that, in its first two years, the OZ designation increased employment growth relative to comparable tracts by between 3.0 and 4.5 percentage points in metropolitan areas. The job growth occurred in multiple industries and persisted into 2021 rather than quickly disappearing. However, most of the jobs created by the program were likely taken by residents who live outside of the designated tracts, consistent with only 5% of U.S. residents working in the same Census tract as the one in which they live.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Funding: The authors are grateful for the financial support of an award from UW-Madison’s Fall Research Competition.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03223 .</content>

    <title>Revisiting the CEO Effect Through a Machine Learning Lens</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An important debated topic in strategic management concerns the so-called “chief executive officer (CEO) effect,” which quantifies the impact that CEOs have on the performance of the firms that they lead. Prior literature has empirically investigated the CEO effect and found support for both theses: a significant effect and no effect at all. We note, however, that virtually all prior studies have relied on an empirical specification that leverages in-sample data, which could be unreliable in certain circumstances. In this paper, we utilize machine learning models and predictive analytics based on out-of-sample data to revisit the CEO effect. In particular, we operationalize the CEO effect as the gain in the out-of-sample predictive accuracy by adding the CEO information to the model input in addition to the firm information. By analyzing 1,245 firms and 1,779 CEOs over 20 years, we demonstrate that the results of the approach from the literature have limited external validity. More specifically, we convey that the analyses are purely based on in-sample data and that the predictive effects of CEOs are not substantive when out-of-sample test data sets are used. Although our main analysis relies on optimized distributed gradient boosting, we also conduct extensive robustness tests spanning close to 100 models with alternative algorithms and specifications, all of which yield consistent results.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03625 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study gender and race in high-impact entrepreneurship using a tightly controlled randomized field experiment. We sent out 80,000 pitch emails introducing promising but fictitious start-ups to 28,000 venture capitalists and angels. Each email was sent by a fictitious entrepreneur with randomly assigned gender and race. Female entrepreneurs received 9% more interested replies than males pitching identical projects and Asians received 6% more than Whites. Our results suggest that investors do not discriminate against female or Asian entrepreneurs when evaluating unsolicited pitch emails and that future research on investor biases should focus on networks and in-person interactions.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Funding: The grant is Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada Insight Development [Grant 430-2019-00306] “Gender and racial discrimination in venture capital” through the University of British Columbia.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.4990 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we investigate market design for online gaming platforms. We ask what motivates people to continue participation—success or failure. Using data from an online chess platform, we find strong evidence of heterogeneous history-dependent stopping behavior. We identify two behavioral types of people: those who are more likely to stop playing after a loss and those who are more likely to stop playing after a win. We propose a behavioral dynamic choice model in which the utility from playing another game is directly affected by the previous game’s outcome. We estimate this time nonseparable preference model and conduct counterfactual analyses to study alternative market designs. A matching algorithm designed to leverage stopping behavior can substantially alter the length of play.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03628 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how the supply of talent affected financial development based on an experiment that abruptly changed the allocation of talent in historical China. Under the meritocratic civil examination system, government service was the main employment for the Chinese intellectuals. The abolition of this system in 1905 reduced the status and wealth attached to government service, which led the intellectuals to turn to modern banking as a high-status sector of employment. We find that regions where there were more candidates for the civil examination produced more financial professionals after 1905, which translated to a greater development of modern banking.This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance.Funding: C.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Standard applications of the consumption-based asset pricing model assume that goods and services within the nondurable consumption bundle are substitutes. We estimate substitution elasticities between different consumption bundles and show that households cannot substitute energy consumption by consumption of other nondurables. As a consequence, energy consumption affects the pricing function as a separate factor. Variation in energy consumption betas explains a large part of the premia related to value, investment, and operating profitability. For example, value stocks are typically more energy intensive than growth stocks and thus riskier, because they suffer more from the oil supply shocks that also affect households.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: C.

    <title>The Competition for Partners in Matching Markets</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the competition for partners in two-sided matching markets with heterogeneous agent preferences, with a focus on how the equilibrium outcomes depend on the connectivity in the market. We model random partially connected markets, with each agent having an average degree d in a random (undirected) graph and a uniformly random preference ranking over their neighbors in the graph. We formally characterize stable matchings in large random markets with small imbalance and find a threshold in the connectivity d at [Formula: see text] (where n is the number of agents on one side of the market), which separates a “weak competition” regime, where agents on both sides of the market do equally well, from a “strong competition” regime, where agents on the short (long) side of the market enjoy a significant advantage (disadvantage). Numerical simulations confirm and sharpen our theoretical predictions, and demonstrate robustness to our assumptions. We leverage our characterizations in two ways: First, we derive prescriptive insights into how to design the connectivity of the market to trade off optimally between the average agent welfare achieved and the number of agents who remain unmatched in the market. For most market primitives, we find that the optimal connectivity should lie in the weak competition regime or at the threshold between the regimes. Second, our analysis uncovers a new conceptual principle governing whether the short-side enjoys a significant advantage in a given matching market, which can moreover be applied as a diagnostic tool given only basic summary statistics for the market. Counterfactual analyses using data on centralized high school admissions in a major U.S. city suggests that both our design insights and our diagnostic principle have practical value.This paper was accepted by Gabriel Weintraub, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [Grant CMMI-1201045].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00064 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The transmission of information is crucial for productivity and growth. However, language differences may limit its effectiveness. This is particularly relevant for knowledge platforms that aim to be global, given the cultural diversity of the pool of users. In this paper, I empirically investigate how the exogenous cost of language affects communication quality and the trade-offs faced by knowledge platforms in implementing their website in multiple languages. I exploit the staggered introduction of websites for languages other than English on a question-and-answer platform to demonstrate two main facts. First, nonnative English speakers who contribute in English increase their answers’ quality once able to use their native language, and their answers are more likely to solve the questioner’s problem. The native-language answers drive the effect, which is larger when the question quality is higher and the incentives are stronger. Second, users who participate in their native language but not in English contribute lower-quality answers compared with those who contribute in English. This suggests that lower language barriers allow users with less expertise in the subject to participate. These results show that the platform should adopt multiple languages to maximise the quality of the information collected, although doing so may also result in an inflow of low-quality content from new users.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01333 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A significant portion of U.S. households enters and exits investment accounts. Empirically, income and wealth changes are related to these transitions, with income changes not affecting the retired. A life cycle model with participation costs cannot match the observed ownership dynamics, but an extension with stock market crash better fits the average participation rate and ownership transitions of the middle-aged and retired. This extended model does not match the ownership dynamics of the young, which are better captured by a model with elevated income risk. Overall, these findings indicate that ownership transitions respond to wealth shocks across the life cycle, both in our model and the data.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00290 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops a new approach to volatility ambiguity and studies its implications for equilibrium consumption, portfolio choice, and asset prices. Our approach does not require equivalence between priors. The measure of ambiguity is based on the statistical confidence in the reference model that can be assessed with sample statistics. The approach is analytically tractable and amenable to empirical/calibration analysis. A stochastic discount pricing formula is given. At sensible levels of volatility ambiguity, the empirical regularity of equity premium and consumption growth in U.S. data can be the equilibrium outcome of our model featuring a relative risk aversion (RRA) coefficient within a reasonable range.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Funding: H.

    <title>Imperfect Targeting and Advertising Strategies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The ability to successfully target consumers has been substantially affected by recent developments in digital markets, such as improvements in tracking technologies or General Data Protection Regulation. In this paper, we set up a game theoretic model to examine the implications of such changes in targeting success on firms’ targeting strategies and profits. We explicitly consider that firms can target different consumer groups—that is, high- or low-valuation consumers—and that targeting is imperfect—that is, a firm may not reach the intended consumer. We find that a higher targeting success rate has a nonmonotone effect on firms’ profits—that is, lowering profits if targeting is rather imprecise but raising profits if targeting is relatively accurate. If the probability of successful targeting is low, firms target high-valuation consumers (competition for cherries). More fine-tuned targeting then amplifies competition and decreases profits. Instead, if targeting is sufficiently precise, more fine-tuned targeting increases profits because firms segment the market by targeting different consumer groups. Improvements in the targeting ability also have profound effects on the number of products a firm offers and on the profitability of offering products that appeal not only to a single consumer group. First, although increased targeting success raises the attractiveness of introducing an additional product, it also heats up competition. A firm may therefore optimally reduce the number of products it sells if targeting success increases. Second, if products have a broader appeal, market segmentation is more likely to occur. However, aggregate profits are lower compared with when products are narrow.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: Financial support from the German Research Foundation [DFG Project 462020252] is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03632 .</content>

    <title>Nonstationary A/B Tests: Optimal Variance Reduction, Bias Correction, and Valid Inference</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop an analytical framework to appropriately model and adequately analyze A/B tests in presence of nonparametric nonstationarities in the targeted business metrics. A/B tests, also known as online randomized controlled experiments, have been used at scale by data-driven enterprises to guide decisions and test innovative ideas to improve core business metrics. Meanwhile, nonstationarities, such as the time-of-day effect and the day-of-week effect, can often arise nonparametrically in key business metrics involving purchases, revenue, conversions, customer experiences, and so on. First, we develop a generic nonparametric stochastic model to capture nonstationarities in A/B test experiments, where each sample represents a visit or action associated with a time label. We build a practically relevant limiting regime to facilitate analyzing large-sample estimator performances under nonparametric nonstationarities. Second, we show that ignoring or inadequately addressing nonstationarities can cause standard A/B test estimators to have suboptimal variance and nonvanishing bias, therefore leading to loss of statistical efficiency and accuracy. We provide a new estimator that views time as a continuous strata and performs poststratification with a data-dependent number of stratification levels. Without making parametric assumptions, we prove a central limit theorem for the proposed estimator and show that the estimator attains the best achievable asymptotic variance and is asymptotically unbiased. Third, we propose a time-grouped randomization that is designed to balance treatment and control assignments at granular time scales. We show that when the time-grouped randomization is integrated to standard experimental designs to generate experiment data, simple A/B test estimators can achieve asymptotically optimal variance. A brief account of numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the analysis.This paper was accepted by Baris Ata, stochastic models and simulation.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01205 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I show that passive ownership negatively affects the degree to which stock prices anticipate earnings announcements. Estimates across several research designs imply that the rise in passive ownership over the last 30 years has caused the amount of information incorporated into prices ahead of earnings announcements to decline by approximately one-fourth of its whole-sample mean and one-sixth of its whole-sample standard deviation.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00836 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that the return autocorrelation of underlying stock is an important determinant of expected equity option returns. Using an extended Black-Scholes model incorporating the presence of stock return autocorrelation, we demonstrate that expected returns of both call and put options are increasing in the return autocorrelation coefficient of the underlying stock. Consistent with this insight, we find strong empirical support in the cross-section of average returns of equity options. Our paper highlights the necessity to control for stock return autocorrelation when studying option return predictability.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03071 .</content>

    <title>What Are the Firm Value Implications of SEC-Challenged Shareholder Proposals?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permits managers to request the exclusion of shareholder-initiated proposals. I construct a novel data set of excluded and withdrawn proposals from the SEC’s responses to managers’ requests. An examination of announcement returns to withdrawal and exclusion decisions demonstrates that SEC-challenged proposals are value destroying. I find that special interest investors pursuing self-serving agendas and retail investors advocating for one-size-fits-all reforms explain the value-destroying nature of SEC-challenged proposals. On average, the SEC challenge benefits firm value by filtering out these harmful proposals. However, a regression discontinuity design reveals that proposals the SEC refuses to exclude may receive majority shareholder support and destroy firm value.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: I thank the Swiss Finance Institute for its generous financial support.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01344 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Corporate managers overextrapolate past earnings in their earnings guidance, and this behavior is robust after including extensive controls, such as expectation management, earnings management, and overconfidence. The degree of overextrapolation is driven by the persistence of the underlying earnings process and other factors that affect representativeness heuristics, including trend, salience, and volatility. Experience and value diversity among corporate managers help mitigate this bias, whereas demographic diversity does not. Using the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we provide causal evidence that managers overextrapolate past earnings.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00901 .</content>

    <title>The Power of Simple Menus in Robust Selling Mechanisms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a robust selling problem where a seller attempts to sell one item to a buyer but is uncertain about the buyer’s valuation distribution. The existing literature shows that robust screening provides a stronger theoretical guarantee than robust deterministic pricing but at the expense of implementation complexity as it requires a menu of infinite options. Our research aims to find simple mechanisms to hedge against market ambiguity effectively. We develop a general framework for robust selling mechanisms with a finite menu (or randomization across finite prices). We propose a tractable reformulation that addresses various ambiguity sets of the buyer’s valuation distribution, including support, mean, and quantile ambiguity sets. We derive optimal selling mechanisms and corresponding performance ratios for different menu sizes, which show that even a modest menu size can deliver benefits similar to those achieved by the optimal robust mechanism with infinite options, establishing a favorable trade-off between theoretical performance and implementation simplicity. Remarkably, a menu size of merely two can significantly enhance the performance ratio compared with deterministic pricing.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization and decision analytics.Funding: This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72394395].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03738 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify the crucial role social networks play in crowdfunding markets. Investors are 50% more likely to fund projects that their peers support and are 11.2% more likely to fund projects from regions where they share strong social ties, given a one-standard-deviation change in the variables. More influential peers exert a greater influence, especially in the case of riskier projects, and the peer effects are amplified in crowdfunding platforms that prioritize transparency and accountability. Social ties transmit information about economic conditions in project locations, and they complement the influence of peer effects. Furthermore, the social network effects affect project funding outcomes and can be particularly valuable in mitigating the adverse effects of natural disasters. Our findings suggest that social networks play a significant role in crowdfunding markets by increasing investor awareness, disseminating information, and ultimately influencing capital allocations.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: L.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media influencers can grow their number of followers by endorsing products that are authentic for their social media persona or, alternatively, monetize their followers by endorsing a wider variety of products. We develop a dynamic model in which an influencer continuously decides whether to be authentic as she balances increasing awareness with generating revenues from sponsored posts. We derive conditions in which the influencer is authentic during an early growth phase, but she becomes inauthentic once a large enough fraction of potential followers are aware of her. Celebrities become inauthentic at a lower awareness level than pure social media influencers. If posts can go viral, the influencer initially is inauthentic as she hopes to go viral, she later becomes authentic to grow awareness rapidly, and she eventually becomes inauthentic again.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03479 .</content>

    <title>Does Supply Concentration Encourage Cooperation? Evidence from Airlines</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One of a firm’s key strategic decisions is whether to concentrate its input purchases in a small number of suppliers versus spreading them among many suppliers. We propose that supplier concentration solves an interfirm free-riding problem: By internalizing externalities between suppliers, it incentivizes buyer-supplier cooperation. Guided by a simple theoretical model, we investigate this hypothesis on slot exchanges between major airlines and their outsourced regional airline partners during inclement weather, a setting where externalities between suppliers are ubiquitous. We find robust evidence that a regional airline engages in more frequent slot exchanges with its major airline partner when it operates a larger share of the major’s outsourced flights. We also find that this positive effect of concentration on mutual cooperation increases in the size of the externalities between regionals. Our results suggest that, in contrast with Porter’s classic five forces framework, supplier concentration can serve as a governance instrument for buyer-supplier collaborations. More broadly, our paper provides novel evidence on task concentration as a tool to solve free-riding problems in multiagent settings.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: This paper received financial support from the Spanish Research Agency (MICIU/AEI) [Grants PID2022-136983NB-I00, MCIN/AEI /10.13039/501100011033].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03455 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Amid an unprecedented loss of biodiversity, a pressing issue is how to improve the efficiency of conservation with limited resources and information. Collecting data on species with a small population is costly and time consuming, and many high-stakes decisions need to be made based on limited data. We develop a partially observable Markov decision processes model with unknown parameters to jointly optimize the information collection and protection efforts for threatened species. The model takes into account uncertainties about the state, detectability, and dynamics of the species, and it adaptively adjusts the efforts of surveying and protection in real time. Although the standard formulation is intractable, we exploit the structure of ecological problems to identify a hybrid belief state in low dimensions, and we reformulate the stochastic dynamic program as a piecewise deterministic optimal control problem. This enables us to obtain structural insights into the optimal policy (some are in closed form) and find a near-optimal approximate policy with performance guarantee. In certain situations, areas where the species has never been found may be more likely to contain the species than areas where it has been previously found. We also conduct a case study on the conservation of the Hainan gibbon, the rarest primate species, in which we extend the model to optimize the spatiotemporal allocation of limited resources.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [Grant RGPIN-2019-05671].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01753 .</content>

    <title>Worker Empowerment and Subjective Evaluation: On Building an Effective Conflict Culture</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although conflicts typically lead to a waste of resources, organizations may still benefit from a corporate culture that tolerates or even encourages conflicts. The reason is that coordinated conflicts may help to enforce norms and foster cooperation. In this paper, we report results of a series of laboratory experiments designed to explore whether and under what conditions an efficiency-enhancing conflict culture can emerge. Using a principal-agent setup with subjective performance evaluation, we show that establishing a functional conflict culture is a delicate matter. If conflicts are encouraged in a careless hands-off manner, the destructive side of conflicts is likely to dominate. To be successful, a conflict culture requires a careful management of fairness norms. In our experiment, we find that conflicts have positive net effects on efficiency only if an explicit code of conduct is established and conflicts are institutionalized through a grievance process. Thus, providing workers with more power may be a necessary but not sufficient condition for improving productivity when performance evaluations are subjective.This paper was accepted by Axel Ockenfels, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Swiss National Science Foundation [Grant 100018_152903].

    <title>Getting Down to Business: Chain Ownership and Fertility Clinic Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Acquisitions by corporate entities have fueled the growth of chain organizations in healthcare. A chain is a multiunit firm under the same ownership and management providing similar services in different locations. Chain ownership has been credited with boosting firm performance in the retail and service sectors but has been criticized for prioritizing profits over the well-being of patients in the healthcare sector. This paper finds that chain ownership improves healthcare outcomes in the market for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Using novel data on U.S. fertility clinics and difference-in-differences methods, we find that IVF cycles increase by 27.2%, and IVF success rates increase by 13.6% after acquisition by a fertility chain. We provide evidence that fertility chains facilitate resource and knowledge transfers needed to enhance quality and expand the IVF market. For example, acquired clinics change IVF processes and procedures to achieve the IVF gold standard of simultaneously reducing higher-risk multiple births and increasing singleton births. We discuss how the fertility sector’s relatively minimal market frictions and information asymmetries may incentivize chain owners to invest in quality.This paper was accepted by Stefan Scholtes, healthcare management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02793 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a general equilibrium model in which investors simultaneously experience money and nominal price illusions. We show that the combined effects of these illusions widen the gap between the elasticities of the earnings yield of low- and high-priced stocks relative to the nominal interest rate. Empirically, we show that the compounded effects of money and nominal price illusions are stronger for low-priced stocks during periods of high inflation and economic downturns and for stocks with low institutional ownership. Our findings are robust when controlling for valuation uncertainties of low-priced stocks, including idiosyncratic volatility and firm age.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03549 .</content>

    <title>Are Employees Committed to Diversity at Work and in Their Personal Lives? The Role of Organizational Antiracist Signaling Following a Racial Injustice Event</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on corporate sociopolitical activism (CSA) is in its infancy, and more research is needed to examine its effects on employees. We draw from the tenets of Signaling Theory to develop and test a model of how organizations' antiracist signaling after a racial injustice event, as a form of CSA, communicates that racial justice is valued sincerely by organizations, and in turn, motivates employee commitment to diversity—both at work and in their personal lives. We also explore boundary conditions (i.e., climate for inclusion, employee race) of this relationship. We test our model with data collected from 367 employees (37.6% Black, 62.4% White) across 4‐time waves, each 1 month apart, using a mixed‐methods (quantitative and qualitative) approach. Results suggest that organizations are viewed as most sincere when they engage in signaling that includes both words (i.e., releasing a statement) and actions (e.g., hiring a diversity officer) relative to when they don't engage in these words and/or actions. Moreover, when organizations signaled a sincere commitment to antiracism with both words and actions, employees were more committed to diversity at work and in their personal lives, though actions taken by the organization were especially important. Moreover, a strong climate for inclusion reduced the need for actions, while a weak climate for inclusion increased the need for a statement. Theoretical, research, and practical implications are discussed.</content>

    <title>Quiet Quitting in Times of Uncertainty: Definition and Relationship With Perceived Control</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Uncertain times—such as periods of political turmoil, economic instability, health, or climate crises—can diminish individuals' perception of control over their environment. This paper hypothesizes that reduced perceptions of control may impact how individuals relate to their work, specifically, triggering quiet quitting, where employees intentionally refrain from tasks beyond their job requirements. Evidence supports this hypothesis: for example, the phenomenon of quiet quitting has resurged in the post‐pandemic era, coinciding with a significant decline in workers' perceived control around that time. However, no research has yet explored the relationship between perceived control and quiet quitting. Drawing on motivation theory, this paper posits that workers' perceived control, reflected in their beliefs about the effort‐reward link, can explain quiet quitting. To test this, we conducted two extensive online surveys with two main objectives: first, to conceptually refine and operationalize the construct of quiet quitting with a 5‐item scale; second, to examine the relationship between perceived control and quiet quitting. Our findings reveal a significant negative association between workers' perceived control and their propensity to engage in quiet quitting. This relationship is partially mediated by a reduced affective commitment to the employer and an elevated sense of replaceability. A direct implication of our results is that initiatives aimed at restoring workers' sense of agency at work might reduce quiet quitting behaviors.</content>

    <title>Popularity Feedback and Adaptation Strategies in Online Dating: A Social Comparison Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digital platforms are increasingly employing informational nudges to motivate user participation. This paper examines the provision of popularity information as a feedback mechanism and its impact on users’ adaptation strategies. Leveraging ego utility theory and self-determination theory, we hypothesize that comparative popularity information—information that facilitates social comparison—will trigger different reactions based on gender and popularity level. In collaboration with an online dating service provider, we designed and conducted two randomized field experiments in which we provided popularity feedback to platform users and investigated their post-feedback behavioral changes in two adaptation strategies: the selectiveness in choosing potential partners (i.e., selectivity calibration) and the frequency of their online profile modifications (i.e., self-marketing). In the first experiment, where we revealed information about their popularity relative to other users, we found that those who received low-popularity feedback significantly increased self-marketing efforts and lowered their selectivity, but the opposite was observed in individuals who received high-popularity feedback. We also found that men readily made adaptations to their selectivity calibration and self-marketing, whereas women’s behaviors were more persistent as they exhibited little strategic change. We then conducted a second experiment in which we revealed absolute popularity instead of comparative popularity and observed no significant changes in adaptation strategies. Comparing the outcomes of the two experiments, we argue that it is the social comparison information associated with comparative popularity that drives user behavioral changes.</content>

    <title>Design Principles for Information Categorization Quality in Crowdsourced Crisis Mapping Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crisis mapping platforms have transformed disaster management and digital humanitarian efforts by allowing victims to quickly submit “Requests for Help” (RFH) messages directly from disaster locations via mobile devices. On these platforms, online volunteers are often engaged in processing and categorizing messy and incomplete RFH messages into structured and useful crisis reports that can aid first responders in their recovery efforts. This research note examines the case of the Ushahidi platform deployed during the 2010 Haiti Earthquake to propose design principles for a crisis mapping platform that facilitates the conversion and categorization of victim-submitted RFH messages into actionable crisis reports for on-site first responders. To validate the proposed design principles, we instantiated them with the help of a template, and conducted a series of experiments to confirm the effectiveness of the template in improving the categorization quality of crisis reports. We expect that the design principles will be particularly useful for developing digital platforms aimed at humanitarian crisis response that requires a large-scale participation of online crowd volunteers.</content>

    <title>Privacy Concerns and Data Donations: Do Societal Benefits Matter?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Data donations, where individuals are encouraged to donate their personal information, have the potential to advance medical research and help limit the spread of pandemics, among other benefits. The decision to donate data is fundamentally a privacy decision. In this research, we build on the privacy calculus, a model describing privacy risks and benefits, and examine the impact of privacy concerns on data donation decisions, highlighting the role of societal benefits in privacy decisions. Based on two randomized experiments using the general context of data donation for medical research (Experiment 1) and the specific context of data donation for COVID-19 research (Experiment 2), we find that individuals who are highly concerned about privacy tend to donate less data (Experiments 1 and 2). This effect holds under a variety of conditions and is consistent with prevailing research. However, this effect is contingent on the privacy calculus. When implicit or explicit societal benefits are perceived, particularly in the absence of privacy controls, the association between privacy concerns and data donation decisions is less salient, highlighting the significant role that societal benefits play in privacy decisions. We discuss the theoretical, practical, social, and ethical implications of these findings.</content>

    <title>How Artifact-Based and Authority-Based Coordination Affect Propagation Costs in Open Source Software Development</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The success of open source software (OSS) projects depends on their ability to produce software architectures with low propagation costs, as such architectures demand little effort from developers. This study focuses on the project’s form of coordination—the way in which interdependent contributions are managed—as a driving force behind propagation costs. It distinguishes between two coordination archetypes. First, artifact-based coordination is found in egalitarian projects, in which developers only use the work artifact (the architecture itself), without direct interaction, to coordinate. Second, authority-based coordination is used in hierarchical projects (e.g., Linux Kernel) or when companies pay developers for their work. Using a computational model, this study compares these two coordination mechanisms by simulating how they build software architectures (formalized as design structure matrices) from interdependent contributions. As a contextual condition, the model considers the degree of architecture visibility, which is the developers’ (in)ability to see recent additions to the architecture. The model provides two insights. First, artifact-based coordination, as compared to authority-based coordination, generally leads to lower propagation costs. Second, decreasing the degree of architecture visibility reduces propagation costs, an effect that I describe as focal-layered superposition. These insights contribute to the literatures on coordination in OSS development and the mirroring hypothesis. They also have practical implications for the creation of preferable architectures in OSS development.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While a large body of information systems (IS) literature has investigated the antecedents and consequences of data breaches in organizations, we do not have a good understanding of whether a data breach has a material impact on individuals whose private information is compromised and how much damage it causes. We overcome empirical challenges in investigating the impact of data breaches on individual victims by utilizing a unique natural experimental setting that allows us to credibly identify treated and controlled populations—the breach of South Carolina (SC) taxpayer records in 2012. With residents in SC as the treatment group and those in Georgia and North Carolina as the control group, our difference-in-differences estimations find that after the breach at the SC Department of Revenue, there was a significant increase in denials to SC residents’ residential mortgage applications for refinance and home improvement. We also find that the adverse impact of the breach was more profound for Black and Hispanic residents. Our study provides significant theoretical and policy implications with respect to the harm and costs of a large-scale data breach.</content>

    <title>The Hidden Cost of IT Innovation: Access to Emerging Technologies and the Gender Wage Gap</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although an extensive information systems literature has explored the economic benefits of information technology (IT) investments, how these benefits are distributed between male and female IT workers has not been as closely examined. This paper bridges this gap by addressing two questions: (1) Do women and men have similar opportunities to acquire skills related to new IT innovations? (2) How do these differences affect the gender pay gap? We argue that women are underrepresented in roles that use emerging technologies due to two interrelated processes: demand-side labor market conditions and supply-side job sorting. By analyzing two independent datasets that provide insights into wages, career trajectories, and skill prerequisites for IT roles, we found that women are less likely to apply for jobs requiring expertise with emerging technologies. Such positions often require extended work hours, frequent job mobility, and geographic relocation—which can conflict with the family responsibilities typically assumed by women. Yet because these positions tend to offer higher wages, women’s underrepresentation in these roles exacerbates the gender pay gap in the IT sector. Our findings stress the importance of creating more flexible job structures and enhancing women’s access to emerging technology roles as critical for achieving gender equity in the IT industry.</content>

    <title>Defending Your Own or Trolling the Haters: A Configurational Approach to Incivility in Online Communities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study explores the emergence of incivility in online communities, challenging the traditional perspective that attributes incivility to individual elements of sociotechnical systems. We argue that this narrow focus fails to recognize the complex interactions between these elements, leading to a rudimentary understanding of how incivility originates and evolves. To address this gap, our research employed fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), examining approximately 4.3 million posts from 100 diverse online communities on Reddit. Through this analysis, we identified five distinct paths that converged into two primary community configurations: close-knit and scattered communities. Each configuration exhibits unique affordances whose activation fosters incivility in different ways. Based on these findings, we expand the understanding of incivility to include subtle, indirect behaviors beyond overt forms such as trolling or hate speech and show how the interplay of multiple community elements produces affordances, avoiding the narrow view of individual affordances and shedding light on variations of social systems. Finally, we demonstrate that within the same digital platform, different social systems can impact user behaviors, including incivility.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online games are one of the most popular information systems in the world, with over 2 billion users worldwide. Most users follow the social norms and standards of behavior in online games, but some violate social norms, negatively affecting others’ gameplay experiences and weakening loyalty to the game. The social norms in games and other online environments often differ from the social norms in the real world, so are users who violate norms doing so deliberately or are they unaware of the norms? Our results suggest that many users violate social norms because they do not understand them—about a third of the 1,093 participants in our study reported being unsure of the social norms in an online game they played regularly. Greater experience with a game did not significantly increase social norm awareness. Instead, perceptions of social presence, and learning routines (i.e., community learning and instructional support) influenced social norm awareness, which in turn influenced norm compliance. Thus, a technology’s social affordances, social presence, and learning routines are more important than experience using a technology for helping users become aware of and comply with social norms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we study whether and how behavior toward newcomers impacts their socialization outcomes in terms of retention and the quality of contributions in online communities. By exploiting a natural experiment on a large deal-sharing platform, we found that an intervention that proactively reminds other community members to be more considerate of newcomers caused newcomer deals to receive 54% more comments and increased the positive sentiment of the comments. The newcomers in the treatment group were 10% more likely than newcomers in the non-treatment group to post another deal, suggesting an increase in retention. However, we did not observe any effect of the intervention on the quality of subsequent contributions. Our evidence suggests that the intervention merely caused a temporary shock to newcomers’ first contributions but did not improve their learning or motivate greater effort in subsequent contributions. We draw implications on the design of socialization processes to help communities improve the retention and performance of newcomers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Contemporary IT project teams engage in creative problem solving to address increasingly complex business problems, highlighting the need to promote IT project team creativity. Collaboration technologies are widely used in IT project teams, but little is known about what collaboration technology features can be used to improve IT project team creativity and what the underlying influencing mechanisms are. To address this important gap, the current study builds on the extended team knowledge framework to identify collaboration technology features and decodes their influencing mechanisms on IT project team creativity by drawing on the novel creative synthesis theory originating in the management literature to the IT project team context. We identify three sets of collaboration technology support features—awareness knowledge supports, long-term knowledge supports, and transitional knowledge supports—and posit that their use can improve IT project team creativity by facilitating the creative synthesis process, which includes the three subconstructs of collective attention, similarity building, and enacting ideas. The research model is supported in general by empirical data collected through a multisourced survey of over 500 team members and their leaders from 62 IT project teams. We conclude with a discussion of theoretical and practical implications.</content>

    <title>Advancing Understanding of Scaling Health Information Infrastructures: Learning from EHR Initiatives in England</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many countries are developing health information infrastructures (HII) such as integrated electronic health records (EHRs) as a means of improving healthcare efficiency and effectiveness. However, efforts to build and scale up HII are fraught with challenges, as exemplified by the well-known case of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. In particular, HII scaling initiatives give rise to tensions, such as across geographical boundaries of EHRs, which are often not effectively addressed in practice. At the same time, there have been calls for research on scaling IS through a practice perspective, which adds to the existing categorical analysis of scale. Thus motivated, we aim to conceptualize the scaling of HII, focusing on the tensions between scales, the practices to accomplish scaling, and their consequences for scaling outcomes. To do so, we undertook a case study of recent NHS efforts to integrate EHRs in England, where we analyzed these scalar concepts and their interrelationships. Our study further develops the notion that scaling not only involves increasing the scale of IS but entails constructing and reconstructing scales. We also offer theoretical contributions by conceptualizing the range of scalar tensions and practices, their interplay, and their influences on HII scaling outcomes. Tensions that we identify as associated with different scale boundaries (organizational, spatial, and technological), extend those recognized in prior research. Furthermore, we uncover the scalar practices of joining and differentiating, adding to the governance and architectural approaches for HII scaling examined in past work. Through deepening the understanding of HII scaling, we generate insights for practitioners by highlighting scalar tensions and practices that could address the tensions under different conditions. Overall, we draw attention to scaling phenomena as being integral to the development of HII and introduce a new vocabulary for thinking about HII scaling.</content>

    <title>Emergence of IT Implementation Consequences in Organizations: An Assemblage Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ex nihilo nihil fit—nothing comes from nothing—fundamentally challenges IS scholars to explain how a new behavior may emerge and evolve into a recognizable practice from an organization’s IT implementation processes. Prior research addressing this problem has ascribed consequences to a preexisting macrolevel structure or microlevel interactions. We examined this issue by conceptualizing the emergence of IT implementation consequences as a multiphased process with analytically disaggregated phases. Using an assemblage lens, our theorizing draws on data from a multisite case study of body-worn camera technology implementation in three municipal police organizations in the U.S. We identified three emergence phases—individuation, composition, and actualization—and developed a process model theorizing a path from material and expressive components to IT implementation consequences through cascading properties and capacities. Our model shows that the emergence of IT implementation consequences is nonlinear and involves feedback loops across multiple phases. In some instances, IT implementation consequences may emerge via negative feedback loops involving tweaks and course correction before converging into recognizable new practices. In other instances, they may fail or convergence into recognizable practices may be delayed. We also show how combining existing components and assemblages results in nesting assemblages at successively larger scales.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We join the important effort of embracing diverse views on causality reflected in a prior MIS Quarterly Editor’s Comment (Mithas et al., 2022b). Specifically, we aim to expand the discussion around a major causal framework and toolkit that, we believe, is largely missing and needed in empirical studies in the field of information systems: that of causal diagrams and structural causal modeling (SCM). Being relatively new, the SCM framework has faced resistance from economists that has only recently begun to soften and, for this reason, remains largely absent in econometrics textbooks and in the curriculum of most information systems PhD programs. In contrast to viewpoints emphasizing the dichotomy between SCM and econometrics or potential outcomes approaches, we explain how SCM can serve as a complementary layer of identification and communication that aligns with such proven design and analysis frameworks. We discuss the current limitations of the SCM framework and opportunities for new research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To maintain elderly individuals’ ability to live independently in their own homes, technologies such as sensors and the internet of things can be used to facilitate real-time monitoring and automate emergency detection and alerts to enable first responders to deliver help on time. This study examines the design problems associated with such activity monitoring systems, particularly how to support the situational awareness of community first responders who are located remotely and do not have professional healthcare knowledge. Based on a three-year action design research study that investigated a sensor-based monitoring system for elderly people deployed in a natural community setting, we developed abstract design knowledge. Four design principles aimed at enhancing responders’ perceptions, comprehension, and projection of information are proposed to promote informed decision-making and timely responses by drawing on the situational awareness model. In addition to the nascent design knowledge regarding remote activity monitoring in different instances, this study extends our knowledge of the community-based model by foregrounding its multiplicity and the active roles of community stakeholders in providing care to elderly people.</content>

    <title>Understanding the Effectiveness of Rewarding Recipients on Online Referral Behavior</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online referral programs predominantly focus on incentivizing referrers to make referrals but largely ignore the potential of rewarding recipients to motivate referral behaviors. In this paper, we systematically examine whether, how, and when rewarding recipients could effectively motivate referrers with five experiments across a variety of settings. The results demonstrate that rewarding recipients is effective in motivating referrers to behave prosocially and make referrals. Interestingly, referrers behave prosocially when they are not rewarded, but the effectiveness of rewarding recipients is reduced if referrers are rewarded. We also reveal that referrers’ prosocial behaviors are primarily driven by altruistic motivation, rather than the pursuit of either reputational or collective benefits; notably, offering rewards to referrers dampens their altruistic motivation. Finally, we find that referrers’ prosocial behaviors are inhibited with an increased action cost of their referral behaviors, while their prosocial behaviors persist, even with an increased interpersonal cost associated with the referral behaviors. We conclude by offering theoretical and managerial implications for designing effective referral strategies that leverage the potential of rewarding recipients.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper reviews the main motivations and arguments of my work on comparative development, colonialism, and institutional change, which was often carried out jointly with James Robinson and Simon Johnson. I then provide a simple framework to organize these ideas and connect them with my research on innovation and technology. The framework is centered around a utility-technology possibilities frontier, which delineates the possible distributions of resources in a society both for given technology and working via different technological choices. It highlights how various types of institutions, market structures, norms, and ideologies influence moves along the frontier and shifts of the frontier, and it provides a simple formalization of the social forces that lead to institutional persistence and those that can trigger institutional change. The framework also enables us to conceptualize how, during periods of disruption, existing—and sometimes quite small—differences can have amplified effects on prosperity and institutional trajectories. In this way, it suggests some parallels between different disruptive periods, including the onset of European colonialism, the spread (or lack thereof) of industrial technologies in the nineteenth century, and decisions related to the use, adoption, and development of AI today.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social movements are catalysts for crucial institutional changes. To succeed, they must coordinate members’ views (consensus building) and actions (mobilization). We study union leaders within Myanmar’s burgeoning labor movement. Union leaders are positively selected on both ability and personality traits that enable them to influence others, yet they earn lower wages. In group discussions about workers’ views on an upcoming national minimum wage negotiation, randomly embedded leaders build consensus around the union’s preferred policy. In an experiment that mimics individual decision-making in a collective action setup, leaders increase mobilization through coordination. (JEL D91, J38, J51, O15)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online labor platforms for short-term remote work have many more job seekers than available jobs. Despite their relative abundance, workers capture a substantial share of the surplus from transactions. We draw this conclusion from demand estimates that imply workers’ wages include significant markups over costs and a survey that validates our surplus estimates. Workers retain a significant share of the surplus because demand-side search frictions and worker differentiation reduce direct competition. Finally, we show that applying traditional employment regulations to online gig economy platforms would lower job posting and hiring rates, reducing aggregate surplus for all market participants, including workers.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We construct a dataset of firms’ discount rates (i.e., required returns to capital) and perceived cost of capital using corporate conference calls. The relation between discount rates and the cost of capital is far below the one-to-one mapping assumed in standard theory, as it takes many years for changes in the cost of capital to be incorporated into discount rates. This pattern leads to large and time-varying discount rate wedges that affect firm investment. Moreover, increasing discount rate wedges can account for the recent puzzle of “missing investment.” Cross-firm variation in market power and riskiness explains the evolution of wedges.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Geographic dispersion of depositors, borrowers, and banks may prevent funding from flowing to high-loan-demand areas, limiting credit access. Using bank-county-year-level data, we provide evidence of geographic imbalance of deposits and loans and develop a methodology for investigating the contribution to this imbalance of branch networks, market power, and scope economies. Results are based on a novel measure of imbalance and estimation of a structural model of bank competition that admits interconnections across locations and between deposit and loan markets. Counterfactual experiments show branch networks, scope economies, and local competition affect credit flow to disadvantaged markets. (JEL C43, G21, G28, L13, R32)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We measure how cuts to public procurement propagate through the banking system in a financial crisis. During the European sovereign debt crisis, the Portuguese government cut procurement spending by 4.3 percent of GDP. We find that this cut saddled banks with nonperforming loans from government contractors, which led to a persistent reduction in credit supply to other firms. We estimate a bank-level elasticity of credit supply with respect to procurement demand of 2.5. In a general equilibrium model, our findings point to large effects of fiscal policy on credit supply and output in a crisis. (JEL E23, E44, E62, G01, G21, H57)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A large literature has examined how best to target antipoverty programs to those most deprived in some sense (e.g., consumption). We examine the potential trade-off between this objective and targeting those most impacted by such programs. We work in the context of an NGO cash transfer program in Kenya, employing recent advances in machine learning methods and dynamic outcome data to learn proxy means tests that jointly target both objectives. Targeting solely on the basis of deprivation is not attractive in this setting under standard social welfare criteria unless the planner’s preferences are extremely redistributive.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;My research suggests that world inequality is explained by the incidence of extractive and inclusive institutions. But why do some countries have extractive institutions? I distinguish between two main reasons; first, power relations; second, the “normative order.” Normative orders provide justifications and legitimacy for institutions which may not generate prosperity, but may achieve other goals. These distinctions are critical because they create very different challenges in trying to make institutions more inclusive and create prosperity. I show how countries move from the economic periphery as a consequence of changing both. My own intellectual journey has been in the other direction, however, hence the title of the paper: I was fortunate to be born in Britain, but I have had to unlearn much of my own experience, socialization and training in order to see other societies on their own terms. That’s crucial to be able to help them, but also to learn from them. (JEL D02, D63, E23, K00, O43, Q32)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use the tools of mechanism design combined with the theory of risk measures to analyze how a cash-constrained owner of an asset with known, stochastic returns raises capital from a population of investors who differ in their risk aversion and budget constraints. The issuer partitions the asset’s cash flow into several asset-backed securities, one for each type of investor. The optimal partition conforms to the commonly observed practice of tranching into senior debt, junior debt, and equity. Tranching arises endogenously due to the differences in risk appetites among agents and in the budget constraints they face. (JEL D81, D82, G12, G41, G51)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building on recent studies on founders' entry strategy and the attention‐based view, our study examines the underexplored relationship between entrepreneurial entry mode and funding performance. We offer a novel perspective on how different entry strategies—such as hybrid, portfolio, and full‐time entrepreneurship—impact start‐up performance. Additionally, we develop a theoretical framework highlighting founder attention as a mediator in this relationship. Our research was conducted in the crowdfunding context, with findings remaining consistent across multiple measures of founder attention and funding performance. To address potential endogeneity concerns, we employ two‐stage instrumental variable analyses and a propensity score matching method, ensuring the robustness of our results.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs' choice of entry strategy plays a critical role in shaping their ability to secure funding and drive their start‐up success. Our study highlights how different entry strategies—hybrid, portfolio, and full‐time entrepreneurship—affect funding performance, particularly in the crowdfunding context. A key insight is the role of founder attention in mediating the relationship between entry strategy and funding success. The way founders allocate their focus across different pursuits influences investor perceptions and financial outcomes. Therefore, aligning entry strategies with the ability to effectively manage and signal commitment to ventures is essential from a practical standpoint. Moreover, entrepreneurs and investors should consider how strategic entry choices impact not only operational execution but also the likelihood of securing financial support.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how shootings at schools—an increasingly common form of gun violence in the States—impact the educational and economic trajectories of students. Using linked schooling and labor market data in Texas from 1992 to 2018, we compare within-student and across-cohort changes in outcomes following a shooting to those experienced by students at matched control schools. We find that school shootings increase absenteeism and grade repetition, reduce high school graduation, college enrollment, and college completion; and reduce employment and earnings at ages 24–26 years. We further find school-level increases in the number of leadership staff and reductions in retention among teachers and teaching support staff in the years following a shooting. The adverse impacts of shootings span student characteristics, suggesting that the economic costs of school shootings are universal.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We modify a canonical experimental design to identify the effectiveness of retractions. Comparing beliefs after retractions to beliefs (1) without the retracted information and (2) after equivalent new information, we find that retractions result in diminished belief updating in both cases. We propose this reflects updating from retractions being more complex, and our analysis supports this: we find longer response times, lower accuracy, and higher variability. The results—robust across diverse participant groups and design variations—enhance our understanding of belief updating and offer insights into addressing misinformation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Labour productivity in manufacturing differs starkly across regions in China. We document that productivity, wages, and start-up rates of non-state firms have nevertheless experienced rapid unconditional regional convergence after 1995. To analyse these patterns, we construct a Hopenhayn model that incorporates location-specific capital wedges, output wedges, and entry barriers. Using Chinese Industry Census data, we estimate these wedges and examine their role in explaining differences in performance and growth across prefectures. Entry barriers explain most of the differences. We investigate the empirical covariates of these entry barriers and find that changes in barriers are causally related to changes in the size of the state sector: a smaller state sector leads to lower entry barriers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Adapting to a Changing Environment with Steady DecisionsMost real-world decision making unfolds in changing environments. When yesterday’s data may no longer depict today, how much past data should guide future decision making? Use too little and you chase noise; use too much and you overlook new trends. In “A Stability Principle for Learning under Nonstationarity,” Huang and Wang propose a simple stability principle: keep adding past data until the bias it incurs exceeds the natural statistical noise. Their theory shows that the proposed approach can optimally adapt to unforeseeable changes in the environment for a broad spectrum of statistical learning and decision-making problems. At its core are a novel similarity measure for different decision-making objectives and a segmentation technique that breaks down the nonstationary data stream into quasistationary pieces. Simulations and real-data experiments spanning several nonstationarity patterns confirm the approach’s ability to make steady yet responsive decisions.</content>

    <title>Monitoring, Performance Reviews, and Retaliation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the effects of retaliation on optimal contracts in a hierarchy consisting of a principal, a monitor, and an agent. With probability m, the monitor observes a signal about the agent’s effort and decides what to report to the principal. With probability [Formula: see text], the monitor only observes an uninformative default signal realization. The agent retaliates against the monitor and the principal whenever the monitor’s report reduces the agent’s payment from an endogenously determined default level. We show that the principal’s optimal contracting problem can be divided into two steps: First is an information acquisition stage. The principal chooses how much retaliation to tolerate, and more retaliation generates more informative signals (in the Blackwell sense) about the agent’s effort. Second, given the information acquired, the principal designs the optimal payment schemes, which pool moderately (potentially all) bad agent performances with the uninformative signal realization. The empirical literature documents that supervisors are reluctant to provide poor ratings and that performance reports are often inflated and compressed.

    <title>What Makes Consumption Experiences Feel Special? A Multi-Method Integrative Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article addresses a simple theoretical question of high substantive relevance: What makes a consumption experience special in a consumer’s mind? To answer this question, the authors report an extensive multi-method investigation involving a grounded theory analysis of numerous consumer narratives and in-depth interviews, a field survey, a scale development study, a natural language processing analysis of more than 3 million Yelp reviews, a preregistered multi-factor causal experiment (and its preregistered replication), a blind comparison of hundreds of matched visual Instagram posts by third-party observers, and several small application studies. The findings converge in identifying three major psychological pillars of what makes consumption experiences feel special to consumers, each pillar involving different facets: (a) uniqueness, which arises from the rarity, novelty, irreproducibility, personalization, exclusivity, ephemerality, and surpassing of expectations of the experience; (b) meaningfulness, which pertains to the personal significance of the experience in terms of symbolism, relationships, self-affirmation, and self-transformation; and (c) authenticity, which relates to the perceived genuineness and realness of the experience in terms of its psychological proximity to some original source, iconicity, human sincerity, and connection to nature. As illustrated in the General Discussion, the findings have important substantive implications for the engineering of hedonic consumption experiences.</content>

    <title>You Get What You Pay For! An Economic Analysis of the Impact of Data Sponsorship on Content Production</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractThe pricing strategies employed by internet service providers (ISPs), such as AT&amp;T, can significantly influence the decisions of content creators—like video streaming platforms or app developers—regarding the types of content they offer. One such strategy is “sponsored data,” where content providers pay ISPs so that users can access their content without using their own data allowances. This study examines the effects of data sponsorship on content quality, company profits, and consumer benefits. Our analysis reveals that the efficiency of content providers in producing high-quality content is a critical factor. When creating high-quality content is difficult or expensive, sponsored data allows ISPs to increase their profits but can harm content providers by driving overly aggressive competition for users. Conversely, when producing high-quality content becomes easier or less costly—such as with the support of artificial intelligence—sponsored data can benefit both content providers and consumers, albeit at the expense of ISP profits. As advancements in technology continue to facilitate content creation, ISPs and policymakers must reconsider the structure of data sponsorship programs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We discuss how to estimate the interplay between genes (nature) and environments (nurture), with an empirical illustration of the moderating effect of school starting age on one’s genetic predisposition towards educational attainment. We argue that gene–environment (G×E) studies can be instrumental for (i) assessing treatment effect heterogeneity, (ii) testing theoretical predictions, and (iii) uncovering mechanisms, thereby improving understanding of how (policy) interventions affect population subgroups. Empirically, we find that being old-for-grade and having a higher genetic propensity for education benefits children on assessment tests as they progress through school. In this setting, families appear to increase genetic inequalities while schools seem to reduce them.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the effects of the court-ordered removal of children from home on health, crime, and education. To isolate causal effects, I exploit quasi-random variation in judge assignment together with across-judge variation in the tendency to favor removal in an instrumental variable (IV) design. Using a novel data set (N=26,579) based on Swedish court documents that I transcribe and link with detailed register data, I find that court-ordered out-of-home placement has large adverse effects on the mortality of the marginal child. These effects are primarily driven by suicides that occur while the removed child is still placed in out-of-home care. Removal also causes an increase in hospitalizations for mental illness and non-narcotic crimes. There is little evidence of adverse health effects for birth parents. I explore potential explanations for the detrimental effects on child health. Adverse care conditions and peer exposure appear to be important channels.</content>

    <title>On the Optimality of Affine Decision Rules in Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose conditions under which two-stage distributionally robust optimization problems are optimally solved in affine or K-adaptable affine decision rules. Contrary to previous work, our conditions do not impose any structure on the support of the uncertain parameters, and they ensure pointwise (as opposed to worst case) optimality of (K-adaptable) affine decision rules. The absence of support restrictions allows us to transfer nonlinearities from the problem description to the support via liftings, whereas the pointwise optimality implies that decision rules remain optimal for broad classes of distributionally robust optimization problems, including data-driven problems over [Formula: see text]-divergence or Wasserstein ambiguity sets. We demonstrate how our conditions can be met in two applications.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization and decision analytics.Funding: This work was supported by Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [Grant EP/W003317/1].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00053 .</content>

    <title>Learning More Than You Can Know: Introductory Education Produces Overly Expansive Self-Assessments of Knowledge</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Education is a primary engine for gaining knowledge, yet it is unclear if introductory education helps learners gain meta-knowledge, that is, an accurate awareness of the scope and limits of their knowledge. We found that after taking an introductory finance class, relative to a control class, students overclaimed more knowledge they did not have, that is, endorsed more familiarity with bogus finance terms and expressed more confidence under incentives in their ability to answer questions about these terms. This finding was replicated in a Psychology and Law class, compared with a control class, with overclaiming still elevated two years later. In two follow-up experiments, participants in a hypothetical consulting context were randomly assigned to introductory training on GPS or a control topic. Participants in the GPS condition overclaimed more knowledge of bogus GPS terms and were more confident in their knowledge of real material never covered in the training, controlling for test performance. These effects were explained by introductory education both increasing self-perceived expertise in the education domain and creating basic schematic understanding that accommodates plausible but incorrect interpretations of unknown content. Introductory education, then, does not necessarily improve learners’ skills at identifying lack of knowledge. Rather, it can lead to an illusion of knowledge for unknown material, causing learners to overestimate their “circle of competence.”This paper was accepted by George Wu, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported in part by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education at the University of Wisconsin–Madison with funding from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, awarded to S.

    <title>Hiring as Exploration</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper views hiring as a contextual bandit problem: to find the best workers over time, firms must balance “exploitation” (selecting from groups with proven track records) with “exploration” (selecting from under-represented groups to learn about quality). Yet modern hiring algorithms, based on supervised learning approaches, are designed solely for exploitation. Instead, we build a resume screening algorithm that values exploration by evaluating candidates according to their statistical upside potential. Using data from professional services recruiting within a Fortune 500 firm, we show that this approach improves the quality (as measured by eventual hiring rates) of candidates selected for an interview, while also increasing demographic diversity, relative to the firm’s existing practices. The same is not true for traditional supervised learning based algorithms, which improve hiring rates but select far fewer Black and Hispanic applicants. Together, our results highlight the importance of incorporating exploration in developing decision-making algorithms that are potentially both more efficient and equitable.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether variation in regulatory leniency is associated with the cost of deposits in the banking industry. We predict that lenient regulatory supervision allows for greater bank risk-taking due to delayed intervention, resulting in a higher cost of deposits. Our main finding is a positive association between banks’ cost of uninsured deposits and the leniency of their state regulators, incremental to observable measures of risk and performance. We further show that this result is stronger for riskier banks and when uninsured depositors have a greater ability or incentive to influence deposit rates. These findings suggest that the leniency of bank regulators is priced in uninsured deposit rates and further our understanding of the factors associated with regulatory leniency in the banking industry.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Synergy in Counter-terrorism: Airstrikes, Ground Attacks &amp;amp; Civilian Evacuations in Diverse Topologies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over the past two decades, there has been a rise in localized terrorist organizations that have seized control of geographical regions, leading to intricate spatial topological relations between areas controlled by terrorists and those populated by civilians. Given the complexity and duration of counter-terrorism operations, governments must continually adapt their strategies to defeat terrorists in diverse geographical configurations. These operations can be protracted and expensive, with numerous factors influencing their success. We develop a framework to investigate four spatial topological relations: no overlap between opposing forces, partial overlap, government-controlled regions within terrorist-held areas, and terrorist-controlled regions within government-controlled areas. We determine whether government forces should start strikes and, if so, analyze the allocation of resources between airstrikes and ground operations. Additionally, we assess the maximum acceptable level of civilian casualties resulting from mistaken airstrikes. Further, using an evolutionary game, we conduct an equilibrium analysis of disruptive technologies and strategies—such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) used by governments and the deployment of homemade rockets and bluffing tactics by terrorists—in long-term operations, examining their impact on government strike decisions. Our findings show that achieving complete success requires carefully chosen airstrike- or ground-oriented counter-terrorism operations based on their comparative advantages, while avoiding over-concentration or excessive averaging in resource allocation. In conclusion, our parsimonious framework and associated results contribute to informed optimal decision-making in counter-terrorism operations, taking into account the tradeoff between the strike resources and the disruptive offensive-defensive measures within various geographical relations between opposing forces.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Seruproduction systems have demonstrated excellent rapid response capabilities in both stable and uncertain environments. This study reveals that when compared to the Toyota Production System, theseruproduction method improves rapid response capabilities by 20% and 50% in stable and uncertain environments, respectively. The underlying reasons for this improvement were unclear, so this became a focus of this paper. Static and dynamic Just-In-Time Organization Systems are used to investigate both the flexibility and efficiency ofseruproduction systems under stable and uncertain conditions. Findings show that the rapid response capability of aserusystem is driven by the substitution effect of parallel serus. Efficiency is relatively easy to achieve in stable environments but is more challenging in unstable conditions. Therefore, this study explored methods to achieve high efficiency inserusystems under uncertain environments. A stochastic gradient algorithm and a dynamic allocation algorithm are proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform traditional newsvendor models and can achieve near-optimal performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greater Price Stability Without Sacrificing Optimal Revenue GuaranteesIn today’s digital marketplaces, sellers often rely on dynamic pricing—changing prices frequently—to optimize revenue. However, frequent price changes can undermine customer trust. In a new study published in Operations Research, researchers from the U.S. Naval Academy, MIT Sloan, and the University of Illinois at Chicago demonstrate that it is possible to restrict price changes to only decrease over time—through strategic markdowns—while still achieving strong performance guarantees. Their research shows that optimizing pricing trajectories, even under monotonicity constraints, does not compromise optimal regret guarantees for maximizing revenue. This finding challenges the prevailing assumption that taming price experimentation may hinder success. The work opens new avenues for how online platforms can rethink pricing strategies to foster consumer loyalty without sacrificing profitability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the daunting societal and financial impacts of the opioid crisis, extant research offers only a partial understanding of it, particularly regarding the role of healthcare policy. Accordingly, grounded in institutional theory, we examined how a policy that monitors and financially incentivizes patient satisfaction with pain management during a hospital stay affected opioid prescribing behavior of frontline workers (i.e., prescribers). Leveraging 43 months of opioid prescribing data, our research reveals that the introduction of such a policy is associated with higher opioid prescribing intensity. Furthermore, our results reveal that the policy's unintended consequences were intensified under high levels of prescribing workload and market competition. These findings augment the understanding of the negative impacts of the former and unveil an unfavorable corollary to the positive impacts of the latter. We complemented these results with a qualitative study that revealed the presence of coercive, mimetic, and normative pressures and the influence of prescribing workload and market competition in the prescribing context, instilling confidence in our theorizing, results, and contributions. Our study culminates in prescriptive implications for policymakers, prescribers, and healthcare leaders.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over 80% of car buyers in the U.S. obtain a loan through a dealership. Dealers often mark up lender-provided interest rates (buy rates), but consumers cannot distinguish these markups from total rates. In September 2014, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau made an unprecedented public disclosure regarding its supervision of auto lenders, revealing racial disparities in dealer markups disadvantaging minority borrowers. The Bureau strongly recommended–but did not mandate–that lenders providing loans through dealers eliminate dealer discretion in markups by adopting flat dealer compensation per transaction. We examine the effectiveness of this intervention, referred to as the “supervisory highlights,” in reducing consumer financing and car payments and the racial gap. Using detailed, individual transaction-level data and a regression-discontinuity-in-time design, we find that dealer markups declined by 5.55 basis points (29.32%) after the intervention, saving $66.60 for a typical loan. However, the intervention alsoincreasedbuy rates, resulting in no significant changes to consumers’ total interest rates and total payments. Dealers experienced a slight increase in financing profits but no significant change in vehicle profits. Importantly, the racial gap in dealer markups and total interest rateswidened; dealer markups decreased for both minorities and non-minorities, but they decreased more for non-minorities. Our findings can inform policymakers, lenders, consumers, and dealers about the intended and unintended consequences of such government oversight and provide insights into their underlying mechanisms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Global warming has increased the frequency and intensity of extreme climate change events. We study the impact of severe climate change events, particularly wildfire smoke, on consumer purchases of sustainable products. We exploit the random dispersion of wildfire smoke as a natural experiment and analyze three large-scale wildfires from 2018, 2020, and 2023. We combined retail scanner data with air quality data for the first two events and conducted online surveys for the last event. We show that stores exposed to severe wildfire smoke experience an increased demand for sustainable cleaning products relative to stores facing little to no wildfire smoke. The increase occurs promptly after the wildfire smoke exposure, which is short-lived. We also find stronger effects for refill products and sustainable brands. Survey results corroborate and extend our empirical findings by demonstrating the effect of exposure on attitudinal changes. In summary, this study documents the meaningful impact of climate change events on sustainable consumption by analyzing multiple events over the years using a multi-method approach. The study offers relevant and timely managerial insights as consumers are increasingly exposed to more intense and recurrent climate change events.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study repeated games with anonymous random matching where players can add or remove signals from their records. The ability to manipulate records introduces monotonicity constraints on players’ continuation values, under which sufficiently long-lived players will almost never cooperate. When players’ expected lifespans are intermediate, their ability to sustain cooperation depends on (i) whether their actions are complements or substitutes and (ii) whether manipulation takes the form of adding or removing signals.</content>

    <title>Does Private Equity Ownership Make Firms Cleaner? The Role of Environmental Liability Risks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper shows that private equity (PE) ownership, in private-to-private buyouts, leads to a reduction in pollution when the target company faces high potential liabilities for polluting. Conversely, PE-backed firms increase pollution when environmental liability risks are low, as shown by a novel natural experiment that reduced these risks for projects located on federal land. Exploiting specific PE deals within the energy industry, I find that PE governance is the main driver of the results. The results suggest that increasing litigation and regulation-related risks can mitigate the potentially detrimental effects of PE ownership on stakeholders. (JEL K32, G34, G38, Q50)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the fleet repositioning problem aimed at dynamically optimizing vehicle distributions to maximize long-run average social welfare in a vehicle-sharing system. We model the problem as a Markov decision process under theex antecommitted decision scheme, characterizing the balanced myopic policy as optimal for the average reward setting. This policy efficiently aligns vehicle supply with trip demand and mitigates the curse of dimensionality, enhancing computational efficiency significantly. Our analysis demonstrates that although the balanced myopic policy operates with less information, potentially leading to performance losses, the maximum performance gap relative to theex postdecision scheme asymptotically converges to zero as the system size increases. This finding underscores the asymptotic optimality of the balanced myopic policy, particularly in large systems, making it a robust and effective solution for fleet repositioning. Moreover, we extend our investigation to settings with seasonal demand, confirming that a generalized balanced myopic policy remains optimal. Through comprehensive numerical experiments and a counterfactual case study of a real-world vehicle-sharing system, we quantify the operational value of our approach. This study not only validates the balanced myopic policy against more information-intensive solutions but also illuminates effective heuristic design strategies for improving the efficiency of fleet repositioning in vehicle sharing systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects of hospital consolidations on access to care in a competitive healthcare market in the presence of performance incentives. We consider a transition from a “pre-merger” market configuration where a payer delegates services to a market with two competing hospitals to a “horizontally consolidated” configuration under which the same entity manages two hospitals. We focus on two research questions: How should the payer set access-based performance incentives in response to a horizontal market consolidation? What are the effects of consolidation on patient access to care? We use queueing dynamics to describe patient care processes and analyze the strategic interactions between hospitals and the optimal design of performance-based incentives in different market configurations. Specifically, we consider contracts where hospital compensation for delivering care includes a combination of fee-for-service payments and bonus components tied to the level of access to care patients receive. We derive the optimal bonus-type contracts that the payer can use to adapt to changes in market concentration, and we quantify the resulting impact on patient access to care and social welfare. In our analysis, we consider two alternative settings: the “fixed- FFS” setting, where the fee-for-service component cannot be altered, and the “flexible-FFS” setting, where both the fee-for-service and the bonus components can be adjusted in response to changes in the market composition. Our analysis shows that the bonus-type performance incentives provide payer with the ability to protect patient access to care upon hospital consolidation in a wide range of problem settings, provided that the intensity of competition between the hospitals is sufficiently strong. If, otherwise, the intensity of competition is relatively weak, horizontal consolidation may compromise access to care.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: An Adaptive Optimization Approach to Personalized Financial Incentives in Behavioral Interventions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Obesity is a critical healthcare issue affecting the United States. The least risky treatments available for obesity are behavioral interventions meant to promote diet and exercise. Often these interventions contain a mobile component that allows interventionists to collect participants level data and provide participants with incentives and goals to promote long term behavioral change. Recently, there has been interest in using direct financial incentives to promote behavior change. However, adherence is challenging in these interventions, as each participant will react differently to different incentive structure and amounts, leading researchers to consider personalized interventions. The key challenge for personalization, is that the clinicians do not know a priori how best to administer incentives to participants, and given finite intervention budgets how to disburse costly resources efficiently. In this paper, we consider this challenge of designing personalized weight loss interventions that use direct financial incentives to motivate weight loss while remaining within a budget. We create a predictive model that is able to predict how individuals may react to different incentive schedules within the context of a behavioral intervention. We integrated this predictive model in an adaptive optimization framework that over the course of the intervention computes what incentives to disburse to participants and remain within the study budget. We show that our optimization framework is asymptotically optimal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using real world data from a real world weight loss trial that used financial incentives to incentives weight loss. Our results show that using an 60-80% smaller budget, our adaptive optimization framework is able to help the same number of participants lose weight as an existing one-size-fits-all intervention. Furthermore, using our adaptive optimization framework would spend only $120 per individual across 24 weeks as opposed to the current intervention which would spend $360 per individual in the same time frame to achieve similar clinical outcomes. Our results highlight that providers who choose to implement behavioral interventions at scale will need to use a personalized approach to effectively use their limited budgets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media marketing has been relentlessly developed and integrated into firm operations. On social media platforms, firms rely on a combination of verbal and visual elements to communicate with consumers and attract their attention. The present research investigates how the semantic relationship between text and image information affects consumer engagement (forwards and comments). Leveraging a large-scale dataset of firm-generated messages, we use deep learning, LLM, and topic models to quantify each text-image message with a theorized two-dimensional text-image incongruency (relevancy and expectancy).Relevancyis how closely the information aligns with the main message.Expectancyis how predictable or surprising the information is based on what people expect, which concerns long-term affective and cognitive memories about one’s past and present experiences. We find that the interaction of relevancy and expectancy, two distinct dimensions at the cognitive level, is a crucial antecedent of consumer engagement on social media. High-relevancy-high-expectancy (HRHE) content and low-relevancy-low-expectancy (LRLE) content are the most effective strategies, whereas high-relevancy-low-expectancy (HRLE) and low-relevancy-high-expectancy (LRHE) contents do not work so well. Furthermore, this paper also uncovers the distinct nature of consumer engagement forms in social media settings, including forwards and comments. In particular, HRHE offers an exclusive benefit of boosting forwards while the two strategies are equally effective in eliciting comments. This research derives several important operational implications of consumer engagement and social media marketing by addressing the importance of multi-dimensional text-image incongruency and contributes to the literature on operations management and marketing interface.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Robust Data-Driven Design of a Smart Cardiac Arrest Response System</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the data-driven design of a smart emergency response system for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) that involves drones for automatic external defibrillator delivery and community responders alerted via a mobile application, in addition to ambulances. Our study is motivated by the widespread exploration of drones for delivery service, and the emergence of mobile applications that crowdsource community for emergency response. Based on a historical OHCA dataset with community responders’ response records from Singapore, we develop a robust joint deployment model of drone and ambulance to maximize the survivability of the response system while accounting for data uncertainty in OHCA occurrence and responder behavior. We discretize the planning area into finite demand regions, and allow different regions to have different OHCA demand rates, alert response probabilities and alert response time distributions from responders. Each of these attributes is only known to reside in an uncertainty/ambiguity set constructed from historical data. Our objective is to maximize the worst-case demand-weighted survival rate in the presence of uncertainty. We reformulate the resulting robust deployment model as a mixed-integer linear program, which can be efficiently solved by a proposed row-and-column generation algorithm with convergence guarantee. We illustrate our model and solution approach using real data from Singapore. We find that (i) hedging against uncertainty leads to a higher survival rate of the response system, compared to a sample average approximation deployment approach; (ii) while adding more drones/ambulances to the system exhibits diminishing return, a few drones are sufficient to increase the survival rate dramatically; and (iii) the impact of the behavior of responders on survival outcomes is more significant than that of simply adding drones/ambulances. We also discuss several managerial insights from the numerical experiments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the click and purchase behavior of customers in an online retail setting by employing a structural estimation approach. In particular, we aim to understand the impact of the information available to the customer before and after the click on the customer’s search and purchase behavior. We propose a sequential discrete choice framework to model the customer’s search strategy, where the customer repeatedly decides between continuing her search by clicking on a product, or stopping her search and making a purchase/no-purchase decision. By combining the click and order data, our proposed structural framework allows us todisentangleand separately estimate the attractiveness of a product before and after the click. This, in turn, allows us to identify underrated products which we calldiamonds in the rough: these are products that have low pre-click but high post-click attractiveness; thus, even though such products have a low chance of being clicked, they have a high chance of being purchased, if clicked. The proposed framework provides an online retailer with new tools and insights to better manage the product assortment based on customer click and purchase behavior. We estimate our model on a data set from the Chinese retailer JD.com. Through simulation studies, we illustrate how our model can be operationalized and used for improving assortment decisions by accounting for the customers’ search behavior. In particular, we focus on a subset of 126 substitutable products as a representative sample of the data and find that the optimal assortments under our model significantly increase the expected revenue compared to the actual assortments displayed by JD.com, and two Multinomial Logit (MNL) benchmarks.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Who Benefits from Government Tax-Subsidies for Corporate Charitable Food Donations?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leveraging government tax incentives to prompt corporate charitable giving has gained considerable popularity over the past decade. This paper sheds light on the broader consequences of the U.S. government’s tax-subsidy policy for charitable food donations, which is determined based on the fair market value (FMV) of the donated products. We incorporate the tax-subsidy into a monopolist food retailer’s after-tax profit function. Market demand is both price- and quality-dependent, and the shelf-life of the goods is determined by their initial quality and deterioration rate. The retailer makes joint quantity and pricing decisions over two periods, procuring goods at the start of the selling season and (possibly) donating at the end of period 1. We characterize the retailer’s optimal policy and specify conditions under which she donates some, all, or none of her leftover inventory. We explore the impact of government tax-subsidies on the retailer’s actions, consumer surplus, quantity of donations, and total welfare. We show that tax subsidies may motivate retailers to intentionally create supply scarcity (by donating more) to increase FMV (determined by the second-period price), thereby enhancing tax deductions. While tax subsidies encourage donations, they can also unintentionally harm consumers by reducing supply and raising prices. Interestingly, we show that a higher subsidy does not necessarily lead to more donations; the retailer may choose to donate fewer units to achieve the same tax deduction while increasing sales revenue. We investigate conditions under which tax subsidies can simultaneously increase donations, consumer surplus, and retail profit. We show that this outcome is possible only when retailers donate low-quality goods in modest quantities. Our findings reveal how FMV-dependent tax subsidies can backfire, reducing both consumer surplus and total welfare while benefiting the retailer. Governments must carefully weigh the benefits of donations against potential harm caused to consumers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Robotic mobile fulfillment (RMF) systems automate storage and transportation within fulfillment centers while still relying on human pickers. We focus on two key performance metrics in these systems, aiming to minimize overall completion time (OCT) as the primary objective and the number of required robots (NRR) as a secondary objective. We investigate two interrelated operational problems influencing these metrics:(i)pod selection, which involves choosing the mobile racks for item picking, and(ii)pod scheduling, which entails assigning these racks to pickers and determining the picking sequence. We first explore the pod scheduling problem independently, providing theoretical results. This stand-alone problem is NP-hard with at least two pickers when minimizing OCT and remains NP-hard with even one picker when minimizing NRR. The NRR objective introduces a novel optimization problem structure, contributing to scheduling theory even beyond the RMF context. We demonstrate that a simple but effective scheduling rule is asymptotically optimal for minimizing OCT with multiple pickers. For NRR minimization with a single picker, we derive theoretical performance bounds for two sequencing rules. When incorporating the pod selection problem, we focus on two approaches:(i)sequential and(ii)integrated pod selection and scheduling. The sequential approach handles pod selection first, then pod scheduling, while the integrated approach addresses both problems simultaneously within a single formulation to minimize OCT. Computational experiments using e-commerce order data reveal that the sequential approach achieves significantly faster and constant computation times, with a mean OCT similar to that of the integrated approach. We also find that our sequencing rules can reduce mean NRR by 13% to 28% without affecting OCT, compared to the case where no such rules are used. The sequential approach for OCT minimization and the proposed sequencing rules for NRR minimization are scalable to large systems with any picker count. Our experiments also explore the changes in OCT and NRR values with varying numbers of pickers. These results guide managers in assigning the desired number of pickers for a target OCT and inform managers about the average NRR they can expect for the chosen picker count.</content>

    <title>How Borrowers Respond to Dynamic Incentives? An Exploration of Repayment Decisions on Digital Credit</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how borrowers in digital credit markets respond to dynamic incentives. To this end, we leverage quasi-experimental variation in progressive lending policies to identify causal effects on repayment behavior. Our empirical strategy uncovers systematic heterogeneity in borrower responses across different stages of the borrower–lender relationship. We find that first-time borrowers who receive exogenously larger initial loans are significantly more likely to default—consistent with elevated moral hazard and increased repayment burden effects. In contrast, repeat borrowers who receive larger loan increments relative to their prior borrowing cycle exhibit substantially lower default rates. These contrasting patterns are consistent with a theoretical framework where experienced borrowers interpret loan size increases as credible signals of future credit expansion, thereby reinforcing their incentive to maintain repayment discipline. Supporting this mechanism, we document robust evidence of strategic repayment behavior, particularly among borrowers who advance rapidly through successive loan cycles. Collectively, our findings highlight the critical role of relationship dynamics in shaping borrower behavior and underscore the importance of tailoring progressive lending policies to a borrower’s experience level in order to enhance repayment outcomes across a diverse client base.This paper was accepted by Bruno Biais, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02016 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Well-publicized digital media incidents, in which brand content appears adjacent to “unsafe” content (e.g., negative content that is offensive, harmful, or uncomfortable), highlight the potential risk to a brand’s reputation every time it advertises on digital platforms. Even as content moderation algorithms improve, brands cannot control digital environments fully, making it imperative for marketing managers to develop brand safety processes to keep a brand’s reputation safe withindigitaladvertising ecosystems, among their risk mitigation efforts. The current research accordingly attempts to establish when brand safety concerns are more or less likely to arise, according to specific consumer-, brand-, and incident-related moderators; why consumers react negatively to incidents, depending on their capacity to erode consumer trust in brands; and how and to what extent these combined elements affect various brand-related outcomes. Across data from Twitter (X) and six experiments, the authors distinguish brand safety incidents from other types of brand risks that demand managerial attention, and they empirically showcase how digital brand safety incidents influence consumers’ attitudes and behaviors, as well as advertisers’ outcomes. Building on these empirical findings, this article provides concrete, evidence-based suggestions for how to mitigate incidents, both before and after their occurrence.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers curate collections of items for various reasons and categorize them into subsets or categories based on different criteria as their collections grow. The items in a collection reflect a consumer’s preferences and the categories provide insights into the different contexts in which items are consumed. We develop a novel deep generative modeling framework that captures the network structure of consumer collections using multiple interlocked hypergraphs. Our model employs message-passing variational auto-encoders that leverage hypergraph structures and entity-specific covariates to generate probabilistic deep embeddings for consumers, items and item categories. Applying this framework to digital music collections and playlists of music consumers, we demonstrate that our model outperforms several sophisticated benchmarks in predicting linkages within these collections. We then illustrate how our approach enables firms to generate novel personalized product bundles, recommend relevant items and bundles, and dynamically expand existing bundles with new items. Beyond the music application, our method is broadly applicable to other consumer collections, such as food recipes and content collections on social curation platforms like Pinterest.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools based on Large Language Models (LLMs) are quickly reshaping how researchers conduct surveys and experiments. From reviewing the literature and designing instruments, to administering studies, coding data, and interpreting results, these tools offer substantial opportunities to improve research productivity and advance methodology. Yet with this potential comes a critical challenge: researchers often use these systems without fully understanding how they work. This article aims to provide a practical guide for effective and responsible GenAI use in primary research. We begin by explaining how GenAI systems operate, highlighting the gap between their intuitive interfaces and the underlying model architectures. We then examine different use cases throughout the research process, both the opportunities and associated risks at each stage. Throughout our review, we provide flexible tips for best practice and rules for effective and responsible GenAI use, particularly in areas pertaining to ensuring the validity of GenAI coded responses. In doing so, we hope to help researchers integrate GenAI into their workflows in a transparent, rigorous, and ethically sound manner. Our accompanying website (questionableresearch.ai) provides supporting materials, including reproducible coding templates in R and SPSS and sample pre-registrations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over the last two decades, a growing number of studies of novel forms of social‐symbolic work (e.g., identity work, boundary work, institutional work, values work, etc.) have appeared in the organization and management studies literature. This growing body of research – the ‘turn to work’ in organization theory – has provided important new insights into how actors purposefully participate in the social construction of organizations and their contexts. The aim of this special issue is to build on and extend these insights and in this introductory essay we begin by outlining a framework that provides a useful meta‐theory – the social‐symbolic work perspective – for integrating this stream of research. This perspective revolves around two key concepts: ‘social‐symbolic objects’ defined as meaningful patterns in a social system; and ‘social‐symbolic work’ defined as conscious, reflexive efforts to shape social‐symbolic objects. We then introduce the articles that appear in this special issue and identify important cross‐cutting themes. Drawing on these articles, we go on to identify potentially fruitful areas for future research on social‐symbolic work and end with a challenge to organizational scholars to build on this special issue to move our understanding of social‐symbolic work forward.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most prior research has assumed that employees always appreciate coworker support. However, coworker support exceeding expectations can be considered a double‐edged sword in the workplace. Drawing on expectation violation theory, this research exploreswhenandhowcoworker support exceeding expectations becomes a positive or negative expectation violation that influences employees' interpersonal behaviour. We propose that when employees have a lower level of workplace status, coworker support exceeding their expectations is more likely to be a positive expectation violation and, therefore, will be positively related to employee gratitude and interpersonal citizenship behaviour. In contrast, when employees have a higher level of workplace status, coworker support exceeding expectations tends to be a negative expectation violation and, in turn, is positively related to employee shame and interpersonal counterproductive work behaviour. Two multiwave field surveys with Chinese employees and two scenario‐based experiments with Western workers largely support our hypotheses.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how software development team structures influence performance under varying conditions of product and architectural complexity. Using computational simulation grounded in organizational theory, the research compares feature teams—organized around end-to-end functionality—and component teams—organized around technical subsystems. The findings indicate that feature teams generally outperform component teams, particularly when product complexity is high. Moreover, the study reveals that the effectiveness of team structures is moderated by coordination intensity and team scope. Moderate levels of cross-team coordination yield better outcomes than minimal or excessive coordination, whereas broader subteam scopes can improve performance when coordination is costly or limited. These results have significant managerial implications for software development practice: team structure should be aligned with both the problem space and solution space complexity, coordination mechanisms must be strategically calibrated, and team boundaries should be adjusted based on the organization’s capacity to manage dependencies. The study provides a robust framework for informing team design decisions, offering insights relevant to agile software development. Practitioners are encouraged to adopt a contingency-based approach to team organization, tailoring structural choices to contextual demands in order to optimize delivery efficiency and innovation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dual-Sourcing in the Dark? Order Tracking as Your GuideThis research unlocks the power of real-time order tracking in dual-sourcing inventory systems, tackling both backlogging and lost-sales scenarios. We model a hybrid supply chain: a normal source (a two-stage tandem queue with Erlang processing times) and a fast-track emergency source that skips the first stage. We prove that, under key conditions, the optimal policy follows a dual-threshold structure with an adaptive switching curve, dictated by the emergency source’s workload. We prove this through a three-stage approach: 1) state-space simplification – cutting through complexity; 2) auxiliary system design – introducing a tractable proxy with a novel exchange axiom property to reveal optimal structure; 3) sample-path magic – bridging the proxy’s policy back to the original system. When reality breaks the ideal conditions, we craft a near-optimal heuristic that fully leverages order-tracking information. The analysis reveals a striking contrast; although order tracking benefits both systems, its impact is markedly stronger in lost-sales environments compared to backlogging scenarios.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Smart Servers, Smarter Speed Scaling: A Decentralized Algorithm for Data Center EfficiencyA team of researchers from Georgia Tech and the University of Minnesota has introduced a cutting-edge algorithm designed to optimize energy use in large-scale data centers. As detailed in their paper “Distributed Rate Scaling in Large-Scale Service Systems,” the team developed a decentralized method allowing each server to adjust its processing speed autonomously without the need for communication or knowledge of system-wide traffic. The algorithm uses idle time as a local signal to guide processing speed, ensuring that all servers converge toward a globally optimal performance rate. This innovation addresses a critical issue in modern computing infrastructure: balancing energy efficiency with performance under uncertainty and scale. The authors demonstrate that their approach not only stabilizes the system but achieves asymptotic optimality as the number of servers increases. The work is poised to significantly reduce energy consumption in data centers, which are projected to account for up to 8% of U.S. electricity use by 2030.</content>

    <title>A Theory of Leadership Meta‐Talk and the Talking‐Doing Gap</title>

    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify managers' meta‐level talk about the positive purpose, meaning, and significance of their actions as an overlooked type of leadership behaviour and call it leadership meta‐talk. We outline why leadership meta‐talk is not necessarily truthful or deceptive, but selective and loosely coupled with leadership practice. We discuss varieties of leadership meta‐talk, namely aspirational, sub‐texting, and sensemaking meta‐talk, as well as principled, situational, formulaic, and casual meta‐talk. We show how all varieties of leadership meta‐talk draw people's attention to positive aspects of leadership practice and provide positive interpretations of it. Thus, leadership meta‐talk can positively influence attributions of leadership and portray workplaces as overly harmonious and well‐ordered, masking power imbalances and tensions and creating a quantitative and qualitative talking‐doing gap. We argue that these talking‐doing gaps are systemic rather than pathological features of the contemporary workplace because overly positive leadership meta‐talk responds to systemic pressures and opportunities for managers and provides egocentric, psycho‐relational, and public‐image benefits. In contrast, leadership practice that lives up to leadership meta‐talk is more costly, difficult, and time‐consuming than commonly assumed. Our theory reconciles attributional, behavioural, and romancing views of leadership, and offers new insights into key organizational and societal challenges, including managing healthy workplace expectations.</content>

    <title>Support for Sustainable Development Goal 5 and Social Performance: The Role of Diversity Targets, Work‐Life Balance Practices, and Female Representation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human resource management (HRM) scholarship has neither fully engaged with the United Nation's sustainable development goal 5 (SDG 5—gender equality) nor deepened knowledge of the human resource practices that most likely contribute to the implementation of this goal. We address this gap by investigating the link between SDG 5 and multinational enterprises' (MNEs) social performance. We posit that attention to SDG 5 will facilitate MNEs' capacity to formulate and implement practices to increase gender equality in work settings. Drawing from the sustainable HRM framework and social role theory, we develop three hypotheses related to the role of diversity targets and work‐life balance practices as mediators of the relationship between support for SDG 5 and MNEs' social performance. We also posit that women's representation across the organizational structure strengthens the relationship between support for SDG 5 and diversity targets as well as work‐life balance practices. We tested these relationships with 418 MNEs in the S&amp;P 500. We found that diversity targets and work‐life balance practices (i.e., flexible arrangements and daycare services) mediate the relationship between support for SDG 5 and social performance. In addition, the interaction between women's representation and support for SDG 5 enhances diversity targets and flexible arrangements. We theoretically contribute to the sustainable HRM literature by (a) revealing the reasons for a spillover effect of support for gender equality to other demographic groups; (b) explaining broader societal impacts of support for SDG 5 on the workforce, community, human rights, and product responsibility. To successfully integrate SDG 5, MNEs must weave diversity targets and work‐life balance practices into strategic planning.</content>

    <title>How founders' values enable business model innovation in new ventures: The case of Magnum Photos</title>
    <updated>2025-06-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study explores why and how founders' values lead them to design novel business models. To address these questions, we conducted a historical case study of Magnum Photos, a photo agency whose novel business model revolutionized magazine photography in the mid‐20th century. Our abductive analysis reveals that personal values can be a principal driving force for business model innovation (BMI). Actors who believe that their personal values are difficult to reconcile with existing business models engage in BMI to retain control over activities that are perceived to be central to their values. Our findings highlight values as an important and hitherto under‐studied antecedent of BMI and of entrepreneurial innovation and strategy more generally.Managerial SummaryWhat drives business model innovation in startups? Our study finds that personal values can be a powerful force. Through an in‐depth historical analysis of Magnum Photos, a pioneering photo agency, we reveal how its founders' commitment to creative freedom and integrity led them to reject conventional business models and design an entirely new one. Unlike traditional agencies, Magnum's founders saw certain activities—such as taking, editing, and distributing photographs—as inseparable. This led them to create a cooperative model where photographers retained full control over their work. The new business model not only protected their values but also reshaped the photojournalism industry. This study highlights an overlooked driver of innovation: when personal values clash with existing models, entrepreneurs may be compelled to create new ones.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Intra-Category Multi-Choice Preferences Learning and Assortment Recommendation in E-Commerce</title>
    <updated>2025-06-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a framework for learning customer preferences and optimizing e-commerce assortments, focusing on intra-category multi-choice behavior, where customers buy multiple items within the same category. Unlike traditional discrete choice models (DCMs) that assume single-product purchases, e-commerce data show frequent intra-category multi-product purchases, especially during promotions. To capture this, we introduce the multi-choice rank list model (MC-RLM), which accounts for both multi-choice and substitution effects. Each customer type is defined by a preference ranking and an intended purchase quantity (IPQ), allowing selection of up to IPQ products. The MC-RLM adheres to the regularity axiom and aligns with random utility theory.We present the multi-choice market discovery (MCMD) algorithm to estimate the MC-RLM, extending single-purchase methods to multi-purchase settings. We also introduce behavior-reveal-preference (BRP) rules, using customer behavior data (e.g., clicks, cart additions) to enhance preference estimation. Given the NP-hardness of the assortment optimization problem, we analyze the performance of the revenue-ordered assortments heuristic and provide guarantees. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that can generate personalized recommendations based on real-time customer data. Extensive numerical experiments, including a case study using Tmall data, demonstrate that the MC-RLM outperforms models such as the Independent Choice Model (ICM) and the Multi-Purchase Multinomial Logit (MP-MNL) in predictive accuracy, with BRP rules further enhancing performance. Synthetic experiments confirm that accurately modeling multi-purchase behavior significantly boosts expected revenue.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Information about the number of applicants to a job vacancy might simultaneously signal the degree of competition and vacancy quality. We study how this information affects job search. To do so, we conduct three experiments on a large online job platform in which the treatment varies what information is shown to job seekers. Information about the number of prior applicants to a vacancy increases the number of applications and redirects them to vacancies with few prior applications. Information about vacancy age increases application rates, especially to new vacancies. To further investigate the causal mechanisms, we conduct and analyze a survey choice experiment. We conclude that job seekers prefer to avoid competition rather than use the popularity of a vacancy as a signal of quality.This paper was accepted by Karan Girotra, operations management.Funding: This research was facilitated through a research consulting agreement between A.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;School shootings are a disturbingly regular occurrence in the US. While their direct impact on those involved are well-researched, their broader effects on communities are less understood. We focus on the under-researched question of how such traumatic incidents affect community consumption. Using data from various sources, we find that fatal school shootings decrease grocery purchases by 2.09% in affected communities, lasting up to 6 months. This economic impact is felt more in liberal than conservative-leaning counties. Additionally, extended analysis reveals that these incidents reduce spending at food services and drinking places by 8% and at food and beverage stores by 3%. Three experimental studies provide evidence that this decrease is driven by heightened anxiety around consumption in public spaces, particularly for political liberals. Our work suggests the violence has far-reaching consequences, harming the local economy. The decline in spending highlights the need for community leaders to develop supportive community responses to such horrific incidents, in addition to the resources currently offered to the victims and their families.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Impact of Ad Length on Ad Effectiveness: Do Micro Ads Work?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As media viewers shift expectations toward content and ads, advertisers are increasingly exploring micro ads. Yet, limited research has examined micro ads, especially on TV. This research uses a multimethod approach to investigate micro ad effectiveness on behavioral outcomes and, more broadly, provide insights into the relationship between ad length and ad effectiveness in the current media landscape. Analyzing observational data on retailers’ TV advertising, web traffic, and online sales, the authors find that micro ads spur more immediate web traffic than longer ads. Micro and non-micro ads exhibit similar direct impacts on online sales, but micro ads can indirectly increase online sales more by driving increased traffic. Results from a field experiment using social media ads corroborate these findings, showing that micro ads outperform non-micro ads in driving web traffic and social media engagement. The analyses suggest that viewer impatience for longer ads may be a plausible mechanism that explains why micro ads see increased effectiveness. The findings offer timely insights for advertisers and ad platforms seeking economical, attractive ad inventory.</content>

    <title>The Persistence or Diminishment of Employee Stewardship Behaviour: Exploring the Crucial Roles of Supervisors' Cultural Orientation, Admiration, and Status Conferral</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scholars and practitioners have long sought to clarify ways to motivate employees to engage in stewardship behaviour, which involves personal sacrifices for the public interest. However, a critical question remains unanswered: How does a supervisor's cultural orientation, admiration, and status conferral determine the persistence or diminishment of employees' stewardship behaviour? Drawing on the moral virtue theory of status attainment, we argue that employees' stewardship behaviour either promotes or diminishes subsequent actions through increased or decreased admiration and status conferral from supervisors, depending on supervisors' cultural orientations. Study 1, a vignette‐based experiment involving 222 participants, revealed that supervisors with a collectivist orientation tend to admire and grant status to employees who exhibit stewardship behaviour, whereas those with an individualist orientation tend to decrease such feedback. Study 2, a four‐wave survey with 302 leader–employee dyads, replicated these findings and further explained the role of status conferral in sustaining or diminishing stewardship behaviour in the future. This research advances stewardship theory by revealing the complex dynamics that sustain stewardship behaviour and provides valuable insights for managers aiming to motivate employees to consistently engage in stewardship behaviour.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Financial market regulators have long debated the appropriate frequency of mandatory corporate financial disclosures. Whereas frequent disclosures may help deter overinvestment, they may also encourage short-termism. This paper reports an experiment that examines the effects of varying reporting frequencies on managerial investment decisions. Experimental results indicate that frequent reporting modestly induces short-termism, but it fails to reduce the overinvestment observed in the infrequent reporting regime. Nonbinding communication of intended investment plans does reduce overinvestment, but only in the infrequent reporting regime.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [Grant SES 1949112].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01955 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Narrow bracketing in combination with loss aversion has been shown to reduce individual risk taking. This is known as myopic loss aversion (MLA) and has been corroborated by many studies. Recent evidence has contested this notion, indicating that MLA’s applicability is confined to highly artificial settings. Given the impact of these findings, we reevaluated the evidence on MLA with substantially higher statistical power than in almost all previous studies. We systematically modified the seminal study design by Gneezy and Potters [Gneezy U, Potters J (1997) An experiment on risk taking and evaluation periods. Quart. J. Econom. 112(2):631–645] to include five key adjustments. These involved downscaled returns, return compounding, and extended investment horizons. Our results, which are highly robust to analytical heterogeneity, consistently document the presence of MLA across all experimental conditions.This paper was accepted by John Beshears, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05720 .</content>

    <title>Venture capital funding in Africa: a mixed-methods study of evolving ecosystems and financial discrimination</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Africa’s startup ecosystem is growing rapidly, yet venture capital (VC) funding remains disproportionately allocated to non-African founders. This study investigates the factors driving this disparity, focusing on institutional voids – gaps in legal frameworks, financial infrastructure, and market-supporting institutions – and investors’ perceptions of risk and financial discrimination. We conducted 37 interviews with investors and entrepreneurs to identify the determinants of VC funding, including startup location, founder origin, and international networks. Additionally, a qualitative comparative analysis of 335 African fintech startups revealed the factor configurations that enable startups to secure high levels of VC investment. Historically, the findings reveal that non-African founders have benefited from investor homophily, a preference for investing in individuals with similar backgrounds, to mitigate the perceived risks related to institutional voids. By contrast, African founders faced greater barriers to funding. However, as Africa’s VC ecosystem has matured, local founders have begun to overcome these obstacles. By linking institutional voids to homophily and embedding a postcolonial perspective, acknowledging how historical power dynamics and colonial legacies shape investor perceptions and market structures, this study sheds light on the systemic biases that shape VC funding. These findings offer actionable insights for investors, policymakers, and entrepreneurs aiming to foster a more inclusive VC landscape.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this study, we examine over 100 years of Rothschild’s international activity: we analyze this multinational enterprise’s (MNE’s) cross-border transfer of family-derived firm-specific advantages (FSAs) and the challenges of recombination thereof with novel resources. Family-derived FSAs hinge on the resources and features of the owning and controlling family. During the period of Rothschild’s international success in 19th-century Europe, the family itself served as a recombination mechanism for linking family-derived FSAs with complementary resources across borders. However, deploying family-derived FSAs in the American market and recombining these with nonfamily resources was hindered by bifurcation bias (a dysfunctional, affect-based heuristic characterizing family firms). We trace the manifestations of bifurcation bias over time and investigate its multifaceted impact on Rothschild’s internationalization. We suggest that effective resource recombination in host markets can be constrained by atwo-stage authenticationprocess. Here, the bifurcation bias in a first stage can influence which complementary resources in foreign markets will be accessed and how these will be integrated inside the firm. In a second stage, bifurcation bias can affect the functioning of the very actors supposed to be linking the complementary resources to be utilized and the extant, family-derived FSAs.</content>

    <title>Sparking Innovation: The Effect of Inventor Gender Diversity on Recombinant Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how inventor gender diversity influences firm innovation, particularly recombinant intensity that signifies the firm’s capacity to combine distant knowledge domains into new solutions. Using 23 years of U.S. patent data (1.8 million patents, 4,769 firms) and a novel text-based recombination measure (SPaRK), the study finds that a higher share of female inventors increases firms’ recombinant innovation intensity, patent output, citations, and innovation efficiency. Moreover, inventor gender diversity enhances the innovation productivity of female inventors. Cross-gender collaboration emerges as the key mechanism for these gains, enabling firms to unlock the “diversity bonus,” especially for recombinant intensity. Interestingly, the diversity bonus is not homogenous and depends on how central females are within the firm’s knowledge network. Greater gender diversity also translates into better financial outcomes for firms, indicating that the innovation gains outweigh the costs of diversity. For managers, the study suggests not only hiring and retaining a gender-diverse inventor workforce, but also facilitating cross-gender collaborative environments to activate recombinant intensity and other innovation gains, especially at firms where female inventors are not central. For policymakers, the study provides support for expanding female STEM higher education pipelines to enhance the supply of female inventors and ultimately spark corporate innovation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a satisficing model of choice in which the available alternatives differ in their inherent complexity. We assume—and experimentally validate—that complexity leads to errors in the perception of alternatives’ values. The model yields sharp predictions about the effect of complexity on choice probabilities, some of which qualitatively contrast with those of maximization-based choice models. We confirm the predictions of the satisficing model—and thus reject maximization—in a novel data set with information on hundreds of millions of real-world chess moves by highly experienced players. Looking beyond chess, our work offers a blueprint for incorporating complexity at the level of individual objects into models of choice and for detecting satisficing outside of the laboratory.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How much does firm intangibility amplify CEOs’ persistent private information and reduce firms’ public listing propensity? We develop a model of competing public and private investors financing firms heterogeneously exposed to persistent private cash flows. Equilibrium financing is driven by information rent differentials in CEO compensation. We validate and structurally estimate the model using firm listing and CEO compensation data. We find private (intangible) cash flows exhibit 63% higher persistence than their tangible counterparts. Further, if firm intangibility levels returned to those of 1980, mean listing propensities would increase 5 percentage points while mean CEO variable pay growth would decrease by 61%.</content>

    <title>The consequences of expanded audit reporting: implications of tax key audit matters for tax attribute valuation and auditor-provided tax services</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the consequences of tax key audit matters (KAMs) to the valuation of tax attributes and to auditor-provided tax services (APTS). The literature finds that KAM adoption is not associated with investor or audit outcomes, creating an impetus to identify whether specific KAM topics are more consequential. Tax KAMs are an ideal setting because they are prevalent, taxes are economically important, and auditors can provide tax services to their clients. We find that investors discount the tax avoidance and deferred tax assets of tax-KAM companies, suggesting an incentive for managers to avoid tax KAMs. Consistent with self-interest threats to auditor independence, we find that receiving a tax KAM is negatively associated with clients’ concurrent purchases of APTS, but that clients increase their future purchases of these services when they stop receiving tax KAMs. These results reveal novel consequences of tax KAMs to the valuation of companies’ tax attributes and to APTS incentives.</content>

    <title>Reimbursement Policy and Drug Shortages</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generic drug shortages have posed significant challenges to the U.S. pharmaceutical industry and the government for two decades, causing severe consequences and drawing widespread attention. Substantial efforts have been devoted to identifying the causes, with some linking shortages to Medicare’s adoption of the average sales price (ASP) policy for hospital drug reimbursement. However, little research has captured the connections among reimbursement policies, shortages, and the influence of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which play a key role in representing hospitals to set prices with manufacturers. Recognizing that the reimbursement policy influences shortages through affecting supply chain parties’ decisions, we analyze a drug supply model that captures the essential elements and tradeoffs in drug wholesale price decisions. We find that under the ASP policy, the interplay of two opposing effects, the free-ride effect and the aligning effect, guides wholesale pricing decisions and affects shortage outcomes. We capture key factors influencing these effects and show that the ASP policy actually possesses resistance to shortages of drugs that have experienced shortages. Overcoming the challenges of limited data transparency, especially on GPOs, we further conduct numerical analysis incorporating various data sources (with the aid of machine learning) to gain additional insights. In addition to confirming ASP’s resistance to shortages, the numerical analysis quantitatively investigates the impact of policy and GPO-related parameters. We provide a thorough discussion of policy implications based on our theoretical and numerical findings. Notably, compared with the previously adopted fixed-price reimbursement policy, which we model as a benchmark in our analysis, ASP represents a market-data-driven policy. This distinction underscores the importance of a deep understanding of such policies for future policy evaluation and shortage mitigation.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02223 .</content>

    <title>Mind the Gap: A Psychological and Structural Perspective on Activist Shareholders’ Targeting of Women CEOs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An important challenge faced by women CEOs is that their firms tend to receive more shareholder activism than firms with men CEOs. Frequently, this activism represents attempts by shareholders to direct or override the decisions made by the firms’ leaders. The current paper integrates micro and macro perspectives to explore the factors influencing gender differences in shareholder activism. Drawing on social psychology research, we examine gender role expectations and perceived lack of fit as underlying psychological mechanisms, and we use industry gender type (i.e., men- or women-dominated industry) as an important structural factor that shapes the effects of these psychological mechanisms and women CEOs’ propensity to be targeted by shareholder activism. We test the hypotheses using archival data of shareholder activism at S&amp;P 1500 companies. We also use two vignette-based experiments to examine the underlying mechanisms for why CEO gender relates to shareholder activism differently across industries. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.</content>

    <title>This Paper Is Not for Everyone: The Impact of Dissuasive Framing on Consumer Response to Product Messages</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Conventional wisdom and past research converge on the notion that product messages are more effective when they use a persuasive frame that directly addresses the product’s target customers to indicate a preference match (e.g., “If you like dark coffee, this is the coffee for you!”). In contrast, the current research identifies scenarios where consumers respond more favorably to dissuasive frames—that is, to messages that address the consumers not targeted by the product to indicate a preference mismatch (e.g., “If you don’t like dark coffee, this is not the coffee for you!”). Eight experiments using mixed methods demonstrate that the impact of dissuasive framing on consumer response is positive for target customers and negative for nontarget customers. This occurs because dissuasive framing increases perceptions of the product as a specialized offering intended for a more narrowly-defined target segment (ie, target specificity). Target specificity, in turn, increases (vs. decreases) the perceived fit between the product and target (vs. nontarget) customers, which drives their response. This research sheds light on a novel form of framing and introduces target specificity as a construct with important implications for consumers’ perceptions of fit with a product and their downstream responses.</content>

    <title>Is Fitness Technology-Facilitated Social Comparison the Thief of Well-Being? The Mediating Role of Social Comparison on the Relationships Between Passion and Performance Self-Esteem</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice and Policy AbstractPopular fitness technologies such as Fitbit, Strava, MyFitnessPal, and Apple Fitness+ provide users with information enabling them to compare their activity to that of other exercisers they have added to their app. However, different people will interpret this social comparison information in different ways. This study provides one explanation as to why social comparison information provided by fitness technologies leads to differing performance self-esteem outcomes for exercisers. What we find is that exercisers holding a harmonious passion for their exercise activity can interpret fitness technology-facilitated social comparison information in an adaptive way; that is, to see better others as a state they can obtain and worse others as evidence of their success. Conversely, the obsessively passionate are prone to interpreting such information in maladaptive ways; that is, to see better performing others as evidence of their own failure and other’s poor performance as a sign that they will also falter. These maladaptive interpretations may lead to psychological harm (e.g., reduced self-esteem and well-being). Stemming from these findings, we suggest fitness technology developers consider designing their apps to adapt to exerciser’s characteristics, such as passion, to minimize the negative effects of fitness technology-facilitated social comparison information.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building on prior research about the heterogeneous impact of labor shocks on individuals' propensity to start businesses, we explore how local labor market frictions affect individuals' selection into platform‐based entrepreneurship. Combining detailed data from a large online retail platform with sectoral employment statistics across labor market areas in the United States, we show that entrepreneurs entering the platform during larger local employment declines in related sectors developed more effective customer strategies and maintained stronger sales performance. These entrepreneurs focused more on customer appeal, matched social media channels with the platform's predominant user base, and lowered prices over time.Managerial SummaryThis article examines how local labor market frictions in sectors relevant to a digital platform shape the heterogeneous entry of individuals into platform‐based entrepreneurship—a class of entrepreneurship that became popular with “creator economy” business models where individuals rely on digital infrastructures to access potential customers and monetize their creative labor. We find that entrepreneurs who started platform‐based businesses in deteriorating local employment conditions generated significantly higher sales by being more attuned to customers' needs and wants. We show that these entrepreneurs emphasized customer‐related activities, chose more effective social media channels, and set lower prices after operating for a few periods. Our findings highlight the importance of customer‐related competitive advantages in platform‐based entrepreneurship.</content>

    <title>Partner Similarity and Crossover Product Development: Evidence From the &lt;scp&gt;PC&lt;/scp&gt; Game Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study addresses a critical gap in understanding the development of crossover products, particularly in the context of collaborative product development within the PC game market's supply chain. Traditionally, firms have focused on incorporating common product characteristics from a single market segment (e.g., genre) to minimize potential penalties associated with ambiguous product identities. However, recent trends show that “crossover” products, those that integrate distinctive features from multiple segments, have emerged due to their superior performance. Developing such innovative products requires profound expertise across multiple market segments, especially when supply chain partners collaborate. While prior research has explored the market performance of crossover products, it has offered limited understanding of the conditions required for their development. To address this gap, we propose a theoretical framework grounded in the input–output perspective of operations management, which examines how portfolio similarity between partners influences the ease of expertise reconfiguration and the breadth of segment‐spanning expertise needed for crossover product development. Our findings reveal an inverted U‐shaped relationship between portfolio similarity and the degree of crossover, suggesting that moderate similarity fosters the most effective reconfiguration of expertise. Further, we find that collaboration experience with the partner moderates the inverted U‐shaped relationship.</content>

    <title>Politicized Framing of the Future: Encouraging Innovation in Mature Ecosystems in the Face of Asymmetric De Alio Entrants</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Hubs and participants of mature ecosystems increasingly compete with de alio entrants that are hubs of more innovative ecosystems. Prior research shows how these asymmetric de alio entrants frame to win over participants from mature ecosystems and suggests that hubs of these ecosystems should respond by encouraging innovation among participants. However, extant theory does not explain how hubs frame to achieve this goal. We address this issue by studying a European carmaker who faced Google as an asymmetric de alio entrant. We find that the carmaker encouraged innovation by framing the future. Interestingly, it did so not through business narratives (as entrants do), but through narratives from technology policy discourses – it thus engaged in a politicized framing of the future. We identified two variants of this framing mechanism. First, the carmaker engaged invisionary politicized framing of the future, thereby encouraging innovation in enabling technologies. Second, it pursuedidealistic politicized framing of the future, which promoted innovation in modular technologies. We develop a framework that explains when, how, and why hubs of mature ecosystems frame to encourage innovation in the face of asymmetric de alio entrants. Our study contributes to scholarship on incumbent framing in ecosystems, temporal framing, and inter‐ecosystem competition.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how sales and employment growth shape employee job satisfaction in startups. Grounded in Penrosean growth theory and related literature, we propose an inverted U‐shaped relationship, where excessive growth triggers the “Penrose Effect” and impairs employee job satisfaction. Analysis of multilevelGlassdoor.comdata reveals modest support for this relationship in employment growth, which is stronger for firms undergoing rapid workforce expansion. Exploratory text analysis further suggests that rapid employment growth exposes socio‐structural challenges, and rapid sales growth reveals managerial deficiencies in the scaling of revenues. The differences between these mediating mechanisms suggest that the Penrose effect may be less binding than previously theorized, warranting further scrutiny. Our findings bridge macro‐level growth dynamics with micro‐level employee experiences, providing insights into the contemporary challenges of rapidly growing firms.Managerial SummaryDoes startup growth enhance the employee work experience? If so, is it bound by the rate of growth? Our study offers insights into these questions by combiningGlassdoor.comreviews with startup financial data and reveals that moderate levels of growth can enhance employee job satisfaction, while rapid expansion can undermine it. We identify two key mechanisms: first, rapid employment growth strains workplace dynamics, creating challenges with diversity, inclusion, and team cohesion. Second, rapid sales growth exposes management's limitations in scaling products and services effectively. For startup leaders, these findings shed light on how the tradeoffs of accelerated growth can cascade into employee‐level challenges that impair job satisfaction.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how bank advertising practices contribute to racial disparities in financial markets by steering minorities toward inferior products. We exploit a regulatory change that incentivizes deposit collection at the Freedman’s Savings Bank, the first institution to collect deposits from African Americans post-Emancipation, by facilitating misuse of depositor funds. After deregulation, advertising volume rises, particularly in African American newspapers, leading to increased deposits from Black depositors despite the bank’s insolvency. We identify persuasion as a key mechanism; prescriptive stereotypes and false claims likely amplify advertising’s impact on African Americans, exacerbating historically large depositor losses after the bank’s collapse.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bank capital requirements are based on book values, which are slow to reflect losses. In this article, we develop a dynamic model of banks to study the interaction of regulation and delayed accounting. Our model explains four stylized facts: book and market values diverge during crises, the market-to-book ratio predicts future profitability, book leverage constraints rarely bind strictly even as market leverage fans out during crises, and banks delever gradually after net-worth shocks. We show how delayed accounting can allow the regulator to achieve better outcomes than immediate (mark-to-market) accounting. In an estimated version of the model, the optimal regulation couples faster loan-loss recognition with a modest relaxation of the book leverage constraint.</content>

    <title>A Theory of Cash Flow-Based Financing with Distress Resolution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a dynamic contracting theory of asset- and cash flow-based financing that demonstrates how firm, intermediary, and capital market characteristics jointly shape firms’ financing constraints. A firm with imperfect access to equity financing covers financing needs through costly sources: an intermediary and retained cash. The firm’s financing capacity is endogenously determined by either the liquidation value of assets (asset-based) or the intermediary’s going-concern valuation of the firm’s cash flows (cash flow-based). The optimal contract is implemented with defaultable debt—specifically unsecured credit lines and senior-secured debt—and features risk-sharing via bankruptcy. When the firm does well, it repays its debt in full. When it does poorly, distress resolution mirrors U.S. bankruptcy procedures (Chapters 7 and 11). Secured and unsecured debt are complements because risk-sharing via unsecured debt increases secured debt capacity. Debt and equity are dynamic complements because future access to equity financing increases current debt capacity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates how tax loss carryforward (LCF) rules influence corporate bankruptcies and market-wide productivity. Analyzing data from 29 European countries, I find that stricter LCF deductibility limits significantly increase bankruptcy likelihoods. This is because stricter LCF deductibility limits lower the present value of net operating losses (NOLs) as tax assets, reducing the incentive to keep struggling firms alive. This effect is especially pronounced for business group firms, which can support struggling affiliates through internal capital markets to strategically exploit NOLs. My results suggest that lenient LCF deductibility limits can sustain unproductive firms, impacting market-wide resource allocation and productivity. These findings highlight the trade-off in tax policy between supporting firm survival and ensuring efficient resource allocation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Gender imbalance in time spent on child rearing causes gender inequalities in labor market outcomes, human capital accumulation, and economic mobility. We conduct a large-scale field experiment with a near-universe of US schools to investigate a potential source of inequality: external demands for parental involvement. Schools receive an email from a fictitious two-parent household and are asked to call one of the parents back. Mothers are 1.4 times more likely than fathers to be contacted. We decompose this inequality and demonstrate that the gender gap in external demands is associated with various measures of gender norms. We also show that signaling a father’s availability substantially changes the gender pattern of callbacks. Our findings underscore a process through which agents outside the household contribute to within-household gender inequalities.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a framework to measure the welfare impact of macroeconomic shocks throughout the distribution. The first-order impact of a shock is summarized by the induced movements in agents’ feasible sets: their budget constraint and borrowing constraints. We combine estimated impulse response functions with micro-data on household consumption bundles, asset holdings, and labor income for different US households. We find that inflationary oil shocks are regressive, but monetary expansions are progressive, and there is substantial heterogeneity throughout the life cycle. In all cases, the dominant channel is the effect of the shock on the cost of accumulating assets, not movements in goods prices or labor income.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When a platform has limited inventory, it is important to have a variety of products available for each customer while managing the remaining stock. To maximize revenue over the long term, the assortment policy needs to take into account the complex purchasing behavior of customers whose arrival orders and preferences may be unknown. We propose a data-driven approach for dynamic assortment planning that utilizes historical customer arrivals and transaction data. To address the challenge of online assortment customization, we use a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework and employ a model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to solve the online assortment policy because of the computational challenge. Our method uses a specially designed deep neural network (DNN) model to create assortments while observing the inventory constraints, and an Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to update the parameters of the DNN model, with the help of a simulator built from the historical transaction data. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct simulations using both a synthetic data set generated with a pre-determined customer type distribution and ground-truth choice model, as well as a real-world data set. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach produces significantly higher long-term revenue compared to some existing methods and remains robust under various practical conditions.We also demonstrate that our approach can be easily adapted to a more general problem that includes reusable products, where customers might return purchased items. In this setting, we find that our approach performs well under various usage time distributions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Humans and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms increasingly interact on unstructured managerial tasks. We propose that tailoring this human-AI interaction to align with individuals’ cognitive preferences is essential for enhancing performance. This hypothesis is examined through a field experiment in a multinational pharmaceutical firm. In the experiment, we manipulated four contextual parameters of human-AI interaction—work procedures, decision-making authority, training, and incentives—to align with sales experts’ cognitive styles, categorized as either adaptors or innovators. Our results show that tailored interaction significantly improves sales performance, whereas untailored interaction results in negative treatment effects compared with both the tailored and control conditions. Qualitative evidence suggests that this negative outcome arises from role conflicts and ambiguities in untailored interaction. Exploring the mechanisms underlying these outcomes further, a mediation analysis of AI login data reveals that human-AI interaction tailoring leads sales experts to adjust their AI utilization, which contributes to the observed performance outcomes. These findings support a human-centered approach to AI that prioritizes individuals’ information-processing needs and tailors their interaction with AI accordingly.This paper has been This paper was accepted by Catherine Tucker for the Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: This work was supported by Erling Persson Family Foundation; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung [Grants 100013M 204670, 181364, 185164]; Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse samt Tore Browaldhs Stiftelse [Grant W20-0036]; Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation [Grants 2021.0074, 2021.0133].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03849 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on productivity in the context of taxi drivers. The AI we study assists drivers with finding customers by suggesting routes along which the demand is predicted to be high. We find that AI improves drivers’ productivity by shortening the cruising time, and this gain is accrued only to low-skilled drivers, narrowing the productivity gap between high- and low-skilled drivers by 13.4%. This case study provides evidence that AI and skill are indeed substitutes, offering direct support for the underlying assumption of recent projection exercises regarding job displacement by AI.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI [Grants 23K25495, 23H00828, 22H00847, 22H05009, and 22H00057], JST RISTEX [Grant JPMJRX18H3], and JST ERATO [Grant JPMJER2301].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01631 .</content>

    <title>Privacy and Polarization: An Inference-Based Framework</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Advances in behavioral targeting allow media firms to better monetize based on advertising. However, behavioral ad targeting requires consumer tracking, which has heightened privacy concerns among consumers and regulators. We examine how stricter privacy regulations that ban consumer tracking affect media firms’ content strategies and ideological positioning. We consider a model where media firms choose their ideological positioning and advertising, whereas ideologically heterogeneous consumers select their preferred content based on both their ideology and idiosyncratic taste shocks. We compare two salient informational environments: (1) behavioral ad targeting, where perfect inference about consumers is allowed, and (2) contextual ad targeting, where consumer tracking is banned due to privacy regulations, and media firms can only infer consumer types based on their media choice. We show that privacy regulations that ban behavioral ad targeting incentivize media firms to shift toward more extreme and polarizing positioning in order to draw better inferences about consumer types, even though the shift to more extreme ideological positions can hurt both demand and consumer welfare from content consumption. Compared with the monopoly case, competition increases firms’ inference motives and leads to more polarized content over a wider range of parameters due to an inferential complementarity effect arising from consumer self-selection. Our research uncovers a previously unexplored relationship between privacy and polarization, shedding light on the potential unintended consequences of privacy regulations in media markets.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the NET Institute.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06054 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: In-Store Advertising with Digital Signage</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digital signage at the point of sale is emerging as a significant revenue source for retailers and a growing advertising platform for manufacturing brands. Yet, empirical research on its effectiveness remains limited. This study leverages a novel technology and field experimental data spanning 237 advertising campaigns and 30 million shoppers to fill this gap. We find that digital signage increases the likelihood of purchasing featured products by 8.1%. This effect is amplified for hedonic, novel, and low-priced products, as well as for popular brands. It is also stronger on weekends, later in the day, during favorable weather, in crowded stores, for emotional advertising messages, and in the absence of concurrent promotional cues. The impact of digital signage further increases when it is placed in close proximity to the advertised product. Unlike price promotions, digital signage does not affect spending for those who purchase the products. Notably, exposure to digital signage also boosts sales of other products from the same brand and within the same category, without causing purchase acceleration—indicating that it drives incremental consumption. These findings offer new insights into the efficacy of in-store advertising with digital signage and provide actionable guidance for optimizing its use.</content>

    <title>Indigenizing Brokerage: How Western Brokers Bridge Environment and Nature Worldviews in Global Market Relations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Brokering between actors such as Indigenous producers and Western multinationals participating in global market relations typically requires bridging different worldviews, each with different implications for economic activity: a ‘nature’ worldview where production is often limited to preserve ecological balance, and an ‘environment’ worldview where nature is a resource to be exploited. Given these differences and the traditional hegemony of Western actors, the question of whether and how brokers can facilitate market relations that are beneficial for Indigenous and Western actors alike becomes pressing. Building on recent decolonial literature that has highlighted the possibility of rendering traditionally Western‐dominated market relations ‘more Indigenous’ or ‘less colonial’ and cultural brokerage scholarship, we conducted a case study of a Western consulting firm brokering between an MNC and Indigenous communities in Costa Rica. Based on an effective brokering process after a perceived crisis point, we theorize the model of ‘Indigenizing brokerage’ to explain how brokering between the two worldviews can lead to mutual benefits through three interrelated processes. Contributing to the literature on cultural brokerage and decolonial scholarship, the model introduces a much‐needed framework to better understand what ‘more Indigenous’ could mean in global market relations and adds insights into supply chain brokerage.</content>

    <title>Kinesthetic Properties of Response Scales Yield Different Judgments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research examines how the movements an interface requires of a consumer—that is, its “kinesthetic properties”—can alter what a consumer attends to when responding and, in turn, change the response itself. We compare the kinesthetic properties of two ubiquitous scale formats, slider and radio-button scales. Six studies (plus four in the Web Appendix) show dragging a slider (vs. clicking a radio button) elicits responses that are closer to the scale starting point. This effect occurs because the slider allows participants to engage with the scale as they consider their options. When dragging past each response option, attention is directed to that option, increasing its chance of being selected. Supporting this account, sliders only result in responses closer to the starting point when participants physically drag the cursor across options to their desired response, not when they directly click on it. Furthermore, participants dragging a slider interact with the scale earlier in the judgment process and exhibit a greater visual focus on left-side (vs. right-side) options on the scale compared to participants clicking a radio button. These findings suggest marketers, graphic designers, and researchers should consider how the kinesthetic properties of digital interfaces may shape consumer judgment.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractCan organizational boundaries still hinder knowledge-sharing in an online setting such as corporate online communities? Whereas the existing studies usually respond “yes” to the question, our study argues that this is not necessarily the case. We propose and empirically test two key motivations driving knowledge-sharing inclinations subjected to organizational boundaries, namely, knowledge-focused motivations and social-related motivations. Our analyses focus on departmental boundaries using data from a large corporate Q&amp;A platform. We show a robust pattern: employees are more inclined to share knowledge within their departments (i.e., intradepartmental knowledge-sharing inclination). Notably, intradepartmental knowledge-sharing inclination is uniquely driven more by knowledge-focused motivations (versus social-related motivations). Managers should consider the revealed intradepartmental knowledge-sharing inclination when designing policies to promote knowledge sharing across departmental boundaries, and the focus should be on social-related motivations. Also, it is worth noting that intradepartmental knowledge-sharing inclination is also driven by knowledge-focused reasons, reflected by knowledge providers’ desire to share helpful knowledge, and the knowledge-focused mechanisms are not necessarily detrimental to knowledge sharing. Finally, it is reassuring that we do not find negative associations between intradepartmental knowledge sharing and individual material outcomes such as work performance and promotions.</content>
