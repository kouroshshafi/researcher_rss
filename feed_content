    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building on recent studies on founders' entry strategy and the attention‐based view, our study examines the underexplored relationship between entrepreneurial entry mode and funding performance. We offer a novel perspective on how different entry strategies—such as hybrid, portfolio, and full‐time entrepreneurship—impact start‐up performance. Additionally, we develop a theoretical framework highlighting founder attention as a mediator in this relationship. Our research was conducted in the crowdfunding context, with findings remaining consistent across multiple measures of founder attention and funding performance. To address potential endogeneity concerns, we employ two‐stage instrumental variable analyses and a propensity score matching method, ensuring the robustness of our results.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs' choice of entry strategy plays a critical role in shaping their ability to secure funding and drive their start‐up success. Our study highlights how different entry strategies—hybrid, portfolio, and full‐time entrepreneurship—affect funding performance, particularly in the crowdfunding context. A key insight is the role of founder attention in mediating the relationship between entry strategy and funding success. The way founders allocate their focus across different pursuits influences investor perceptions and financial outcomes. Therefore, aligning entry strategies with the ability to effectively manage and signal commitment to ventures is essential from a practical standpoint. Moreover, entrepreneurs and investors should consider how strategic entry choices impact not only operational execution but also the likelihood of securing financial support.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how shootings at schools—an increasingly common form of gun violence in the States—impact the educational and economic trajectories of students. Using linked schooling and labor market data in Texas from 1992 to 2018, we compare within-student and across-cohort changes in outcomes following a shooting to those experienced by students at matched control schools. We find that school shootings increase absenteeism and grade repetition, reduce high school graduation, college enrollment, and college completion; and reduce employment and earnings at ages 24–26 years. We further find school-level increases in the number of leadership staff and reductions in retention among teachers and teaching support staff in the years following a shooting. The adverse impacts of shootings span student characteristics, suggesting that the economic costs of school shootings are universal.</content>

    <title>Retractions: Updating from Complex Information</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We modify a canonical experimental design to identify the effectiveness of retractions. Comparing beliefs after retractions to beliefs (1) without the retracted information and (2) after equivalent new information, we find that retractions result in diminished belief updating in both cases. We propose this reflects updating from retractions being more complex, and our analysis supports this: we find longer response times, lower accuracy, and higher variability. The results—robust across diverse participant groups and design variations—enhance our understanding of belief updating and offer insights into addressing misinformation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Labour productivity in manufacturing differs starkly across regions in China. We document that productivity, wages, and start-up rates of non-state firms have nevertheless experienced rapid unconditional regional convergence after 1995. To analyse these patterns, we construct a Hopenhayn model that incorporates location-specific capital wedges, output wedges, and entry barriers. Using Chinese Industry Census data, we estimate these wedges and examine their role in explaining differences in performance and growth across prefectures. Entry barriers explain most of the differences. We investigate the empirical covariates of these entry barriers and find that changes in barriers are causally related to changes in the size of the state sector: a smaller state sector leads to lower entry barriers.</content>

    <title>A Stability Principle for Learning Under Nonstationarity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Adapting to a Changing Environment with Steady DecisionsMost real-world decision making unfolds in changing environments. When yesterday’s data may no longer depict today, how much past data should guide future decision making? Use too little and you chase noise; use too much and you overlook new trends. In “A Stability Principle for Learning under Nonstationarity,” Huang and Wang propose a simple stability principle: keep adding past data until the bias it incurs exceeds the natural statistical noise. Their theory shows that the proposed approach can optimally adapt to unforeseeable changes in the environment for a broad spectrum of statistical learning and decision-making problems. At its core are a novel similarity measure for different decision-making objectives and a segmentation technique that breaks down the nonstationary data stream into quasistationary pieces. Simulations and real-data experiments spanning several nonstationarity patterns confirm the approach’s ability to make steady yet responsive decisions.</content>

    <title>Monitoring, Performance Reviews, and Retaliation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the effects of retaliation on optimal contracts in a hierarchy consisting of a principal, a monitor, and an agent. With probability m, the monitor observes a signal about the agent’s effort and decides what to report to the principal. With probability [Formula: see text], the monitor only observes an uninformative default signal realization. The agent retaliates against the monitor and the principal whenever the monitor’s report reduces the agent’s payment from an endogenously determined default level. We show that the principal’s optimal contracting problem can be divided into two steps: First is an information acquisition stage. The principal chooses how much retaliation to tolerate, and more retaliation generates more informative signals (in the Blackwell sense) about the agent’s effort. Second, given the information acquired, the principal designs the optimal payment schemes, which pool moderately (potentially all) bad agent performances with the uninformative signal realization. The empirical literature documents that supervisors are reluctant to provide poor ratings and that performance reports are often inflated and compressed. We show that such a pattern in performance appraisals can arise as firms’ optimal responses to retaliation concerns.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01226 .</content>

    <title>What Makes Consumption Experiences Feel Special? A Multi-Method Integrative Analysis</title>
    <updated>2025-06-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article addresses a simple theoretical question of high substantive relevance: What makes a consumption experience special in a consumer’s mind? To answer this question, the authors report an extensive multi-method investigation involving a grounded theory analysis of numerous consumer narratives and in-depth interviews, a field survey, a scale development study, a natural language processing analysis of more than 3 million Yelp reviews, a preregistered multi-factor causal experiment (and its preregistered replication), a blind comparison of hundreds of matched visual Instagram posts by third-party observers, and several small application studies. The findings converge in identifying three major psychological pillars of what makes consumption experiences feel special to consumers, each pillar involving different facets: (a) uniqueness, which arises from the rarity, novelty, irreproducibility, personalization, exclusivity, ephemerality, and surpassing of expectations of the experience; (b) meaningfulness, which pertains to the personal significance of the experience in terms of symbolism, relationships, self-affirmation, and self-transformation; and (c) authenticity, which relates to the perceived genuineness and realness of the experience in terms of its psychological proximity to some original source, iconicity, human sincerity, and connection to nature. As illustrated in the General Discussion, the findings have important substantive implications for the engineering of hedonic consumption experiences.</content>

    <title>You Get What You Pay For! An Economic Analysis of the Impact of Data Sponsorship on Content Production</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractThe pricing strategies employed by internet service providers (ISPs), such as AT&amp;T, can significantly influence the decisions of content creators—like video streaming platforms or app developers—regarding the types of content they offer. One such strategy is “sponsored data,” where content providers pay ISPs so that users can access their content without using their own data allowances. This study examines the effects of data sponsorship on content quality, company profits, and consumer benefits. Our analysis reveals that the efficiency of content providers in producing high-quality content is a critical factor. When creating high-quality content is difficult or expensive, sponsored data allows ISPs to increase their profits but can harm content providers by driving overly aggressive competition for users. Conversely, when producing high-quality content becomes easier or less costly—such as with the support of artificial intelligence—sponsored data can benefit both content providers and consumers, albeit at the expense of ISP profits. As advancements in technology continue to facilitate content creation, ISPs and policymakers must reconsider the structure of data sponsorship programs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We discuss how to estimate the interplay between genes (nature) and environments (nurture), with an empirical illustration of the moderating effect of school starting age on one’s genetic predisposition towards educational attainment. We argue that gene–environment (G×E) studies can be instrumental for (i) assessing treatment effect heterogeneity, (ii) testing theoretical predictions, and (iii) uncovering mechanisms, thereby improving understanding of how (policy) interventions affect population subgroups. Empirically, we find that being old-for-grade and having a higher genetic propensity for education benefits children on assessment tests as they progress through school. In this setting, families appear to increase genetic inequalities while schools seem to reduce them.</content>

    <title>Surviving Childhood: Effects of Removing a Child From Home</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the effects of the court-ordered removal of children from home on health, crime, and education. To isolate causal effects, I exploit quasi-random variation in judge assignment together with across-judge variation in the tendency to favour removal in an instrumental variable design. Using a novel data set (N=26,579) based on Swedish court documents that I transcribe and link with detailed register data, I find that court-ordered out-of-home placement has large adverse effects on the mortality of the marginal child. These effects are primarily driven by suicides that occur while the removed child is still placed in out-of-home care. Removal also causes an increase in hospitalizations for mental illness and non-narcotic crimes. There is little evidence of adverse health effects for birth parents. I explore potential explanations for the detrimental effects on child health. Adverse care conditions and peer exposure appear to be important channels.</content>

    <title>On the Optimality of Affine Decision Rules in Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose conditions under which two-stage distributionally robust optimization problems are optimally solved in affine or K-adaptable affine decision rules. Contrary to previous work, our conditions do not impose any structure on the support of the uncertain parameters, and they ensure pointwise (as opposed to worst case) optimality of (K-adaptable) affine decision rules. The absence of support restrictions allows us to transfer nonlinearities from the problem description to the support via liftings, whereas the pointwise optimality implies that decision rules remain optimal for broad classes of distributionally robust optimization problems, including data-driven problems over [Formula: see text]-divergence or Wasserstein ambiguity sets. We demonstrate how our conditions can be met in two applications.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization and decision analytics.Funding: This work was supported by Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [Grant EP/W003317/1].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00053 .</content>

    <title>Learning More Than You Can Know: Introductory Education Produces Overly Expansive Self-Assessments of Knowledge</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Education is a primary engine for gaining knowledge, yet it is unclear if introductory education helps learners gain meta-knowledge, that is, an accurate awareness of the scope and limits of their knowledge. We found that after taking an introductory finance class, relative to a control class, students overclaimed more knowledge they did not have, that is, endorsed more familiarity with bogus finance terms and expressed more confidence under incentives in their ability to answer questions about these terms. This finding was replicated in a Psychology and Law class, compared with a control class, with overclaiming still elevated two years later. In two follow-up experiments, participants in a hypothetical consulting context were randomly assigned to introductory training on GPS or a control topic. Participants in the GPS condition overclaimed more knowledge of bogus GPS terms and were more confident in their knowledge of real material never covered in the training, controlling for test performance. These effects were explained by introductory education both increasing self-perceived expertise in the education domain and creating basic schematic understanding that accommodates plausible but incorrect interpretations of unknown content. Introductory education, then, does not necessarily improve learners’ skills at identifying lack of knowledge. Rather, it can lead to an illusion of knowledge for unknown material, causing learners to overestimate their “circle of competence.”This paper was accepted by George Wu, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported in part by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education at the University of Wisconsin–Madison with funding from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, awarded to S.

    <title>Hiring as Exploration</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article views hiring as a contextual bandit problem: to find the best workers over time, firms must balance “exploitation” (selecting from groups with proven track records) with “exploration” (selecting from under-represented groups to learn about quality). Yet modern hiring algorithms, based on supervised learning approaches, are designed solely for exploitation. Instead, we build a resume screening algorithm that values exploration by evaluating candidates according to their statistical upside potential. Using data from professional services recruiting within a Fortune 500 firm, we show that this approach improves the quality (as measured by eventual hiring rates) of candidates selected for an interview, while also increasing demographic diversity, relative to the firm’s existing practices. The same is not true for traditional supervised learning-based algorithms, which improve hiring rates but select far fewer Black and Hispanic applicants. Together, our results highlight the importance of incorporating exploration in developing decision-making algorithms that are potentially both more efficient and equitable.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether variation in regulatory leniency is associated with the cost of deposits in the banking industry. We predict that lenient regulatory supervision allows for greater bank risk-taking due to delayed intervention, resulting in a higher cost of deposits. Our main finding is a positive association between banks’ cost of uninsured deposits and the leniency of their state regulators, incremental to observable measures of risk and performance. We further show that this result is stronger for riskier banks and when uninsured depositors have a greater ability or incentive to influence deposit rates. These findings suggest that the leniency of bank regulators is priced in uninsured deposit rates and further our understanding of the factors associated with regulatory leniency in the banking industry.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Synergy in Counter-terrorism: Airstrikes, Ground Attacks &amp;amp; Civilian Evacuations in Diverse Topologies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over the past two decades, there has been a rise in localized terrorist organizations that have seized control of geographical regions, leading to intricate spatial topological relations between areas controlled by terrorists and those populated by civilians. Given the complexity and duration of counter-terrorism operations, governments must continually adapt their strategies to defeat terrorists in diverse geographical configurations. These operations can be protracted and expensive, with numerous factors influencing their success. We develop a framework to investigate four spatial topological relations: no overlap between opposing forces, partial overlap, government-controlled regions within terrorist-held areas, and terrorist-controlled regions within government-controlled areas. We determine whether government forces should start strikes and, if so, analyze the allocation of resources between airstrikes and ground operations. Additionally, we assess the maximum acceptable level of civilian casualties resulting from mistaken airstrikes. Further, using an evolutionary game, we conduct an equilibrium analysis of disruptive technologies and strategies—such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) used by governments and the deployment of homemade rockets and bluffing tactics by terrorists—in long-term operations, examining their impact on government strike decisions. Our findings show that achieving complete success requires carefully chosen airstrike- or ground-oriented counter-terrorism operations based on their comparative advantages, while avoiding over-concentration or excessive averaging in resource allocation. In conclusion, our parsimonious framework and associated results contribute to informed optimal decision-making in counter-terrorism operations, taking into account the tradeoff between the strike resources and the disruptive offensive-defensive measures within various geographical relations between opposing forces.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Seruproduction systems have demonstrated excellent rapid response capabilities in both stable and uncertain environments. This study reveals that when compared to the Toyota Production System, theseruproduction method improves rapid response capabilities by 20% and 50% in stable and uncertain environments, respectively. The underlying reasons for this improvement were unclear, so this became a focus of this paper. Static and dynamic Just-In-Time Organization Systems are used to investigate both the flexibility and efficiency ofseruproduction systems under stable and uncertain conditions. Findings show that the rapid response capability of aserusystem is driven by the substitution effect of parallel serus. Efficiency is relatively easy to achieve in stable environments but is more challenging in unstable conditions. Therefore, this study explored methods to achieve high efficiency inserusystems under uncertain environments. A stochastic gradient algorithm and a dynamic allocation algorithm are proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform traditional newsvendor models and can achieve near-optimal performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greater Price Stability Without Sacrificing Optimal Revenue GuaranteesIn today’s digital marketplaces, sellers often rely on dynamic pricing—changing prices frequently—to optimize revenue. However, frequent price changes can undermine customer trust. In a new study published in Operations Research, researchers from the U.S. Naval Academy, MIT Sloan, and the University of Illinois at Chicago demonstrate that it is possible to restrict price changes to only decrease over time—through strategic markdowns—while still achieving strong performance guarantees. Their research shows that optimizing pricing trajectories, even under monotonicity constraints, does not compromise optimal regret guarantees for maximizing revenue. This finding challenges the prevailing assumption that taming price experimentation may hinder success. The work opens new avenues for how online platforms can rethink pricing strategies to foster consumer loyalty without sacrificing profitability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the daunting societal and financial impacts of the opioid crisis, extant research offers only a partial understanding of it, particularly regarding the role of healthcare policy. Accordingly, grounded in institutional theory, we examined how a policy that monitors and financially incentivizes patient satisfaction with pain management during a hospital stay affected opioid prescribing behavior of frontline workers (i.e., prescribers). Leveraging 43 months of opioid prescribing data, our research reveals that the introduction of such a policy is associated with higher opioid prescribing intensity. Furthermore, our results reveal that the policy's unintended consequences were intensified under high levels of prescribing workload and market competition. These findings augment the understanding of the negative impacts of the former and unveil an unfavorable corollary to the positive impacts of the latter. We complemented these results with a qualitative study that revealed the presence of coercive, mimetic, and normative pressures and the influence of prescribing workload and market competition in the prescribing context, instilling confidence in our theorizing, results, and contributions. Our study culminates in prescriptive implications for policymakers, prescribers, and healthcare leaders.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Fair Lending in Car Financing: Unintended Racial Consequences of CFPB Supervision of Dealer Markups</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over 80% of car buyers in the U.S. obtain a loan through a dealership. Dealers often mark up lender-provided interest rates (buy rates), but consumers cannot distinguish these markups from total rates. In September 2014, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau made an unprecedented public disclosure regarding its supervision of auto lenders, revealing racial disparities in dealer markups disadvantaging minority borrowers. The Bureau strongly recommended–but did not mandate–that lenders providing loans through dealers eliminate dealer discretion in markups by adopting flat dealer compensation per transaction. We examine the effectiveness of this intervention, referred to as the “supervisory highlights,” in reducing consumer financing and car payments and the racial gap. Using detailed, individual transaction-level data and a regression-discontinuity-in-time design, we find that dealer markups declined by 5.55 basis points (29.32%) after the intervention, saving $66.60 for a typical loan. However, the intervention alsoincreasedbuy rates, resulting in no significant changes to consumers’ total interest rates and total payments. Dealers experienced a slight increase in financing profits but no significant change in vehicle profits. Importantly, the racial gap in dealer markups and total interest rateswidened; dealer markups decreased for both minorities and non-minorities, but they decreased more for non-minorities. Our findings can inform policymakers, lenders, consumers, and dealers about the intended and unintended consequences of such government oversight and provide insights into their underlying mechanisms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Global warming has increased the frequency and intensity of extreme climate change events. We study the impact of severe climate change events, particularly wildfire smoke, on consumer purchases of sustainable products. We exploit the random dispersion of wildfire smoke as a natural experiment and analyze three large-scale wildfires from 2018, 2020, and 2023. We combined retail scanner data with air quality data for the first two events and conducted online surveys for the last event. We show that stores exposed to severe wildfire smoke experience an increased demand for sustainable cleaning products relative to stores facing little to no wildfire smoke. The increase occurs promptly after the wildfire smoke exposure, which is short-lived. We also find stronger effects for refill products and sustainable brands. Survey results corroborate and extend our empirical findings by demonstrating the effect of exposure on attitudinal changes. In summary, this study documents the meaningful impact of climate change events on sustainable consumption by analyzing multiple events over the years using a multi-method approach. The study offers relevant and timely managerial insights as consumers are increasingly exposed to more intense and recurrent climate change events.</content>

    <title>The Double‐Edged‐Sword Effect of Constant Connectivity on Work Performance: Roles of Perceived Value, Work–Life Balance, and Work–Family Conflict</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Constant connectivity through smartphone use represents a major societal challenge, particularly in relation to work performance and work–nonwork boundaries. This research leverages an interdisciplinary theoretical framework, crisis settings, and a cross‐cultural approach (France and the United Kingdom) to specify the impacts of smartphone use on work performance and work–life interfaces, before and during the COVID‐19 crisis, among large samples of employees (NPilot= 229; N1= 938; N2= 1042). An empirical test of this integrative model shows that smartphone use influences work performance directly, work–life balance negatively mediates this relationship, and work–family conflict moderates it. It advances knowledge by considering both dimensions of work performance, generic task performance and adaptive performance, which is crucial for adapting to technologies and crises. This research also emphasizes the need to consider the context in which smartphone use affects work performance, notably in situations marked by high pressure, such as crises that become chronic. By introducing the marketing concept of perceived value as a mediator, this research shows that utilitarian value improves work performance while hedonic value decreases it, thus advancing the scholarly conversation and helping to manage constant connectivity.</content>

    <title>The Six Dimensions of Strong Theory</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One of the most important features on which to judge the merit of any academic paper is the strength of its theory. Although commentary about what constitutes strong theory is widespread, there is no holistic account of the full range of existing perspectives. To address this oversight, I construct a typology composed of six dimensions of strong theory: importance, interestingness, actionability, generality, simplicity, and accuracy. This typology provides a lens to examine a vexing problem: the effort to increase the strength of a theory on one dimension will usually compromise its strength on others. Despite this reality, authors experience pressure in the review process to optimize theories on all six dimensions. I explain how the expectation to build theories that cannot possibly be built (what I call the fruitless search for unicorn theories) is driven by historical forces. The study of organizations emerged not from one source but from a half-dozen distinct traditions, including applied scientists who study time-sensitive problems, disciplinary scholars who identify universal laws of human behavior, and empiricists who prefer a tight link between concepts and measures. Review teams are often composed of referees who hail from different traditions and possess divergent views on theory. Even when each reviewer has concerns that are reasonable in isolation, authors often confront unrealistic expectations when reviewers’ preferences are aggregated. To mitigate this problem, I recommend that authors, reviewers, and editors (1) prioritize fewer dimensions in any single theory and (2) emphasize distinct dimensions in different theories on the same topic.</content>

    <title>When Great Powers Struggle: How Geopolitical Alignments of Small States Are Influenced by Their &lt;scp&gt;MNEs&lt;/scp&gt;</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Comparing two distinct deglobalization periods, this study shows how Finnish multinational enterprises (MNEs) used corporate diplomatic activities (CDA) to influence Finland's alignment with a struggling great power. Drawing from hegemonic stability theory and new institutional economics, we argue that the power's collapsing global networks and institutions exposed Finnish MNEs to cross‐border constraints typical of small states – reliant on but unable to govern the rules set by great powers. We identify two distinct CDA responses aimed at sustaining cross‐border activities: in one period, Finnish shipbuilding MNEs adopted a defensive approach to maintain alignment with the struggling power; in the other, Finnish paper MNEs pursued an explorative strategy to reposition Finland toward alternative powers. Informal institutions at home explain these divergent responses: they either discredited or legitimized existing geopolitical alignments. These CDA mechanisms produced contrasting outcomes: shipbuilders' defensive stance drove de‐internationalization after the collapse of the great power's global networks and institutions, while the paper MNEs' explorative strategy turned shifting geopolitics into an opportunity for renewed internationalization. By showing how MNEs influence diplomatic processes between their ‘small’ home country and great powers, we call on management scholars to take more seriously structural power asymmetries that shape global politics that constrain MNE behaviour during periods of geopolitical instability.</content>

    <title>Space: a new frontier for international business</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article examines (outer) Space as a new frontier for international business (IB) and highlights the unique challenges and opportunities it presents. Unlike terrestrial business environments, Space is characterized by extreme physical conditions, ambiguous property rights, and an institutional vacuum, which disrupt conventional IB theories. The study identifies three key challenges—congestion, contention, and competition—arising from the commercialization of Space and the increasing presence of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in the sector. Utilizing the OLI (ownership, location, internalization) framework, the paper critically reassesses existing IB theories, considering these Space-specific complexities and their long-term implications for global business strategy. Furthermore, it explores the geopolitical and regulatory implications of Space activities, arguing that the absence of effective governance structures necessitates novel policy frameworks and cooperative mechanisms to ensure responsible expansion. The study also underscores the role of MNEs in shaping sustainable Space commercialization, proposing the addition of a new 18th Sustainable Development Goal—Sustainable Space. The findings contribute to IB scholarship by advancing theoretical approaches that account for the spatial, institutional, and competitive dynamics unique to (outer) Space, offering a foundation for future research, policy development, and industry collaboration in the era of Space-based business and security expansion.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study repeated games with anonymous random matching where players can add or remove signals from their records. The ability to manipulate records introduces monotonicity constraints on players’ continuation values, under which sufficiently long-lived players will almost never cooperate. When players’ expected lifespans are intermediate, their ability to sustain cooperation depends on (i) whether their actions are complements or substitutes and (ii) whether manipulation takes the form of adding or removing signals.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: From Growth to Monetization: Managing Freemium Services</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the recent rapid growths of freemium services, we study freemium service providers’ dynamic operating policies to maximize their lifetime profits. We adopt a hybrid of the Bass diffusion model and the replicator equation from evolutionary game theory to capture the user base growth, and model the provider’s dynamic decisions as an optimal control problem. We analyze two variants of the freemium business model inspired by two prominent examples, Dropbox and Spotify, which respectively adopt the monetization strategies of limiting features and advertising (and its removal). We establish the optimal dynamic operating policies for the Dropbox-inspired ad-free freemium model and the Spotify-inspired ad-supported freemium model and identify their distinctive operational characteristics: the optimal policies as well as the sustainability of the Dropbox model critically depend on the network effect among users, whereas the optimal policies of the Spotify model show that advertising could be a more effective monetization strategy than limiting features. The latter observation is confirmed in a general model allowing both monetization strategies where the optimal policies consistently adopt advertising without limiting features. We then show that the freemium model significantly outperforms the ad-supported free model in weak advertising markets and that offering multiple tiers of premium subscription is unnecessary and confirm our core insights’ robustness under a generalized network effect, customized advertisements, and liquidity constraints. Our study establishes the versatility and value of the freemium model to suit distinct needs of a service in different stages from growth to monetization, and provides guidelines for service providers adopting this business model.</content>

    <title>Taking Turns Leading? Rotational Leadership in New Product Development Projects With Supplier Involvement</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the potential value of involving suppliers in buyers' new product development (NPD) projects, there are challenges in integrating distributed resources and actions across organizational boundaries. Insight from theintra‐organizational leadership literature suggests that an effectiveinter‐organizational leadership model could help address project‐level coordination challenges. Adopting an agency theory view complemented by role theory, this study examines the antecedents and outcomes of rotational leadership (i.e., shifting leadership roles in a process) in a buyer NPD project involving suppliers. The results indicate a U‐shaped relationship between rotational leadership and project performance by analyzing a paired sample of quantitative and qualitative data for 279 NPD projects. In a post hoc qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), this study triangulates quantitative results using interview data, showing that buyers adopt boundary buffering to address potential rotational leadership risks while achieving high project performance. Both buyer risk‐taking and supplier relationship‐specific investments contribute to the emergence of rotational leadership. These results enrich supplier involvement in the NPD literature by demonstrating (1) when rotational leadership emerges and (2) how it affects project performance. The findings also provide managerial implications for leadership role arrangements and boundary‐buffering decisions in the context of collaborative innovation in the supply chain.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Rewarding Money or Time? The Sunk Cost Effects of Customized Rewards in Loyalty Programs</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research delves into an overlooked aspect of firm loyalty programs—rewards for consumer temporal efforts (RTE), which pertain to consumer time spent on firm activities, as opposed to rewards for consumer monetary efforts (RME), which pertain to consumer money spent on firm products. Across six main studies, the authors find robust evidence that consumers devalue time as compared to money—they underestimate the sunk costs of time and consider RTE easily earned. Therefore, when consumers receive RTE (vs. RME) customized for select customers without prior notice, they will perceive lower effort-related costs associated with the reward, making them less likely to redeem it. If they choose to redeem it, they tend to purchase more novelty products because they will categorize RTE under the mental account of windfall gains. They are also more inclined to repurchase after redemption due to an elevated sense of gratitude. However, when consumers are reminded of the opportunity costs of their prior temporal efforts, they become just as likely to redeem the reward as those rewarded with RME, owing to the heightened sunk time effect. These findings present a novel customer-engaging strategy for firm loyalty programs, namely rewarding consumer time (RTE) in an unconventional manner.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research examines how customer review content influences review writers’ subsequent decisions. Employing a mixed-methods approach, including a field experiment, a scenario experiment, and archival data analysis, the authors investigated the effects of affective content, cognitive content, and length of customers’ reviews on their subsequent referral and (re)purchase behaviors across various contexts, such as household services, podcast trials, and airline services. The authors leveraged the random assignment of experimental interventions and other shifters to induce exogenous variation in review content features. Additionally, they employed instrumental and proxy variables to address endogeneity issues. Findings from the three studies consistently demonstrate that affective content in reviews enhances referral and repurchase behaviors, whereas cognitive content exerts adverse effects. Moderation analyses show that the effects of review length on these behavioral outcomes depend on individual and contextual factors that affect customers’ elaboration likelihood during review writing. Overall, this research provides actionable insights for strategically shaping customer review content to drive critical business outcomes and enriches theoretical understanding of how content features of customer reviews affect review writers’ decisions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use decision theory to confront uncertainty that is sufficiently broad to incorporate “models as approximations.” We presume the existence of a featured collection of what we call “structured models” that have explicit substantive motivations. The decision maker confronts uncertainty through the lens of these models, but also views these models as simplifications, and hence, as misspecified. We extend the max-min analysis under model ambiguity to incorporate the uncertainty induced by acknowledging that the models used in decision-making are simplified approximations. Formally, we provide an axiomatic rationale for a decision criterion that incorporates model misspecification concerns. We then extend our analysis beyond the max-min case allowing for a more general criterion that encompasses a Bayesian formulation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A collective choice problem specifies a finite set of alternatives from which a group of expected utility maximizers must choose. We associate a collective pseudo market with every collective choice problem and establish the existence and efficiency of pseudo Lindahl equilibrium (PLE) allocations. We also associate a cooperative bargaining problem with every collective choice problem and define a set-valued solution concept, the ω-weighted Nash bargaining set where ω is a vector of welfare weights. We provide axioms that characterize the ω-weighted Nash bargaining set. Our main result shows that ω-weighted Nash bargaining set payoffs are also the PLE payoffs of the corresponding collective pseudo market with the same utility functions and incomes ω. We define a pseudo core for collective pseudo markets and show that pseudo Lindahl equilibria are in the pseudo core. We characterize the set of PLE outcomes of discrete allocation problems and show that they contain the set of pseudo Walrasian equilibrium outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We revisit the recent revealed preference analysis of sophisticated quasi-hyperbolic consumers by Blow et al. [(2021), “Non-parametric Analysis of Time-Inconsistent Preferences”, The Review of Economic Studies, 88, 2687–2734] (BBC). We show that BBC’s revealed preference test is too lax. There are non-rationalizable data that would pass their test. A basic problem with their test is that it requires finding a certain endogenous elasticity, without regard to the rationalizing utility. Their approach motivates a more stringent test, also based on first-order conditions, that would connect the endogenous elasticity and utility: We show that this test is also too lax. Aside from testing, we also discuss the possibility of recovering model parameters. We show that, even when discount factors are exactly identified, the approach followed in BBC allows for incorrect parameter values to lie in their identified set.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When an organization’s environment changes, communication between its members is essential for a timely response. However, past observational studies suggest that communication declines when an organization is exposed to an adverse environmental event. To understand why this might happen, I examine the effects of competition and scarcity—two common features of adverse events—on information sharing and seeking—the microfoundations of organizational communication. In the present study, interactive groups of experimental participants play a novel n-armed bandit game where they work as salespeople for companies that offer a lot of different products (The Sales Game). Some groups experience stable customer demand, while others are exposed to negative or positive demand shifts. Participants earn variable rewards based on their individual performance, and competition is induced in half of the groups through a small bonus based on relative performance. Participants can choose to exchange information with their peers throughout the task. When participants freely exchange information, the increase in individual performance-based rewards is larger than the tiny competitive bonus. But, participants exposed to this competition share information significantly less often than those who are not. This produces a pattern of communication network contraction consistent with prior observational studies of organizations exposed to adverse events. In contrast to prior research, scarcity (negative demand shifts) has no effect on information exchange. These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between competition, scarcity, and interpersonal communication in organizations. They also have important implications for the design of incentive schemes in modern firms.Funding: This research was supported by funds from the Chicago Booth Graduate School of Business and the Division of Social and Economic Sciences [Grant 2018173].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18288 .</content>

    <title>The Strategic Value of Data Sharing in Interdependent Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Large, generalist, technology firms—so-called “big-tech” firms—powerful in their primary market, routinely enter secondary markets consisting of specialist firms. Naturally, one might expect a specialist firm to be fiercely protective of its data as a way to maintain its market position in the secondary market. Counter to this intuition, we demonstrate that a specialist firm willingly shares its market data with an intruding generalist. We do so by developing a model of cross-market competition in which the data collected via consumer usage in one market can improve product quality in another. We show that a specialist firm shares its data to strategically create codependence between the two firms, thereby softening competition and transforming the generalist firm from a traditional competitor into a coopetitor. For the generalist intruder, data from the specialist firm substitute for its own investments in product quality in the secondary market. As such, the act of sharing data makes the generalist a stakeholder in the data collected by the specialist, and consequently in the specialist’s continued success. Moreover, although the firms benefit from data sharing, consumers can be worse off from weakened price competition and lower investments in innovation. Our results have managerial and policy implications, notably on account of backlash against data collection and the market power of big-tech firms.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, information systems.Funding: D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Indigenous communities are resurging and harnessing this momentum to reshape their social world. As they reclaim their cultural resources, rights, and identities, they gain control over how and whether to engage with Western social structures. Using the metaphor ofmetal frameandgrass basketmaterials, we conceptualize how First Nations communities mobilize scaffolding materials from different social realities and innovatively combine them to shape and reshape their social world. We theorize that the degree to which a community integrates different scaffolding materials is consequential for whether and how the community will engage with outsiders. We learn from First Nations communities across northernTurtle Island(Canada) by running a cluster analysis and identifying three different ways communities construct scaffolding using Indigenous and Western materials. Then, using a unique dataset of 240 Canadian First Nations communities, we use those clusters to predict the likelihood a given community will engage in a partnership agreement with an outsider, in this case a non‐Indigenous mining company, and when they might do so. This analysis highlights a kind of entrepreneurial activity, the construction and use of scaffolding, and a context that is overlooked by mainstream entrepreneurship scholars and management scholars in general. We aim to contribute to the recalibration of entrepreneurship literature through a decolonial lens.</content>

    <title>Optimizing Animation Speed: Convex Effects on Perceived Waiting Time and Digital Customer Experience</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Incidental waits are an unavoidable element of the consumer experience on any digital platform. Firms typically utilize no animation or single-speed, repeated animations during these waits. How might the use of such animations and their visual qualities influence perceived waiting time? Can simple design changes by managers influence the customer experience? Although prior research suggests a linear relationship where faster animations reduce perceived waiting time, we find a convex relationship between animation speed and time perception: moderate-speed animations minimize perceived waiting time compared to no, slow-moving, or fast-moving animations (experiments 1a-1c). We refer to this effect as the convex effect of animation speed. This effect occurs when people use animation speed to infer wait time (experiment 2a) and because moderate-speed animations draw more attention than static images or faster animations (experiment 2 b). Animations that introduce dual-attention elements (experiment 3a) or atypical animations (experiment 3 b) shift attention away from movement speed, attenuating this effect. Finally, this effect extends to website click-to-landing rates (experiment 4), conversion rates (experiment 5), and product evaluations during mobile shopping (experiment 6). These findings highlight the practical value of optimizing animation speed in user interface design to enhance both customer experience and business outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a model of multi-dimensional misspecified learning in which an overconfident agent learns about groups in society from observations of his and others’ successes. We show that the average person sees his group relative to other groups too positively, and this in-group bias exhibits systematic comparative-statics patterns. First, a person is most likely to have negative opinions about other groups he competes with. Second, while information about another group's achievements does not lower a person's prejudice, information about economic or social forces affecting the group can, and personal contact with group members has a beneficial effect that is larger than in classical settings. Third, the agent's beliefs are subject to “bias substitution,” whereby forces that decrease his bias regarding one group tend to increase his biases regarding unrelated other groups.</content>

    <title>Content Provision on UGC Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers visiting platforms that host user-generated content (UGC) not only consume content but also generate content by investing time and effort. This paper seeks to examine a UGC platform’s content provision strategy: how a UGC platform can motivate consumers to generate UGC and how it can manage the balance between UGC and the platform’s own content. As UGC and the platform’s own content perform the same function, one may be inclined to think that the two types of content are substitutes. Our analysis shows that they could function as strategic complements. This is because increasing the platform’s own content provision raises the quality of content on the platform, motivates more consumers to join the platform, and increases the total UGC provision on the platform. The public good characteristics of UGC could prompt us to think that UGC provision on the platform will be less than the socially optimal level. Our analysis identifies conditions when the total provision of UGC can be more than the social optimum. One may wonder whether it is profitable for a UGC platform to completely dispense with its own content. We find that it is always profitable for the UGC platform to offer some of its own content. This is because when consumers spend more time consuming the content, the platform can monetize their attention and earn higher ad revenue. Additionally, we find that an increase in ad space on the platform may motivate greater provision of UGC. Finally, we extend the model in several different directions and find that our results are robust.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: W.

    <title>Governing Within Semirigid Limits: Navigating the Centralization–Decentralization Paradox in Blockchain‐Based Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Blockchain‐based platforms can facilitate data sharing and coordination in interorganizational ecosystems by enabling secure, tamper‐evident recordkeeping and streamlined, trust‐minimized transactions across organizational boundaries. However, their decentralized architecture may conflict with the centralized control exercised by platform sponsors, giving rise to a centralization–decentralization paradox. This study explores how this paradox unfolds in a large, blockchain‐based logistics platform that was ultimately discontinued. Through an in‐depth, longitudinal case study, we identify three interrelated governance contradictions—regarding ownership, trust, and growth—that triggered destabilizing oscillations between centralized and decentralized governance modes. We introduce the concept ofsemirigid limitsto capture the bounded flexibility within which governance can be made and adapted under such paradoxical conditions. Our findings show that the centralization–decentralization paradox is especially difficult to navigate when strategic boundary conditions—here, industry competition, fragmented coordination, and high interdependencies—are present. Our study contributes to the paradox and governance literature by theorizing how governance contradictions emerge and persist and by identifying the mechanisms that constrain alignment and adaptation. We also offer guidance for managers in regard to addressing the competing demands of centralization and decentralization in interorganizational platforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Religion plays an important role in the lives of many individuals across the world, influencing various aspects of their lives. One area where the impact of religion is observed—but underexplored—is in consumer behavior. Research on the role of religion in consumer behavior is still developing, and we propose that focusing on religious values offers a promising direction for advancing this area of research. In this paper, we review existing research on values associated with religion and their influence on a wide range of consumer behavior, using Schwartz's values theory and the moral foundations theory as frameworks. But we also seek to build on these frameworks, and we conclude by suggesting potential avenues for future research on relationships between religious values and consumer behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Aglozo and Cohen (Journal of Consumer Psychology, 2025) synthesize prior work on the influence of religious values on consumer behavior through the frameworks of Schwartz's value theory and moral foundations theory. In this commentary, we extend their work by examining the intersection of religious values and branding. First, we build upon existing frameworks to identify pathways through which brands can leverage religious values (people‐based associations, place‐based associations, brand network associations, and activity‐based associations), while also noting important downsides. Second, we discuss how context affects the extent to which consumers behave according to their religious values, focusing on three mechanisms: identity salience, value internalization and framing, and competing consumption values. Finally, we conclude with directions for future work on religious values in consumer research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how stock index inclusion affects corporate financing using a global sample of 198 index events—primarily new index launches—across 21 markets. Firms added to indexes issue more public debt but not equity, leading to a sustained increase in leverage. Inclusion draws greater attention from analysts and the media and increases the likelihood of receiving credit ratings. As a result, indexed firms benefit from more liquid bond markets and lower yield spreads, prompting greater reliance on public debt. Consistent with an information‐driven mechanism, leverage responses are strongest in countries with weaker information environments. However, these information gains do not enhance stock price informativeness: bid‐ask spreads, price impact measures, post‐earnings announcement drift, and the implied cost of equity remain unchanged—likely because of the growing presence of information‐insensitive passive investors.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managers prioritize favorable analysts during earnings calls, reinforcing analysts’ incentives for optimism. However, managers also frequently interact with unfavorable analysts, and this study examines the determinants and benefits of these interactions. I find that managers interact more with unfavorable analysts when compelled to do so. I then examine two likely benefits of these interactions. First, unfavorable analysts attenuate their negative views after interacting with managers. Second, price reactions to management forecasts are stronger for managers who regularly interact with unfavorable analysts, consistent with enhanced reporting credibility. Finally, using peer firm restatements as exogenous shocks to investors’ perceptions of accounting quality, I find that nonrestating firms with managers who regularly interact with unfavorable analysts experience attenuated negative returns relative to other nonrestating peers. Overall, the empirical evidence indicates firms experience significant benefits when managers interact with unfavorable analysts and these benefits persist amongst compelled and voluntary interactions.</content>

    <title>Employer Responsiveness to Online Reviews: A Signal of Caring About Employees</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employer reviews (i.e., online workplace ratings authored by employees) attract broad interest and shape the opinions of potential employees. Thus, companies face the challenge of dealing with these workplace judgments that are outside their direct control. While prevailing theoretical perspectives suggest that responding to third‐party judgments may be an effective way for companies to deal with them, they focus on responses to negative judgments that threaten companies' reputations. Based on signaling theory, we argue that employer responsiveness, signaled by an employer's first response to an employer review, serves as a mechanism of indirect control over employer reviews. Applying a difference‐in‐differences approach—a statistical technique to estimate the causal effect of the treatment (i.e., responsiveness) by comparing it to a control group without the treatment—on a sample of 298,269 reviews of 21,099 employers over 45 quarters posted on the employer review website Kununu, we hypothesize and find that compared to nonresponsive employers, responsive employers receive more diverse (i.e., variety of topics covered) and extensive (i.e., amount of information provided) employer reviews. These effects are especially pronounced in the case of negative employer reviews. Our findings can serve as a guide for employers in dealing with third‐party judgments by demonstrating that employer responsiveness is a valuable signal enhancing online review quality. We contribute to the growing body of HRM research on employer reputation on social media, a critical factor influencing recruitment and retention outcomes. Our study opens new avenues for research to explore the role of responsiveness as a strategic signal in employer brand management.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a macroeconomic theory where demand for goods has a productive role. A search friction prevents perfect matching between producers and potential customers. Larger demand induces more search, which in turn increases GDP and measured TFP. We embed the product-market friction in a standard neoclassical model and estimate it using Bayesian techniques. Business cycles are driven by preference shocks, true technology shocks, and investment-specific shocks. Preference shocks have qualitatively similar effects as true productivity shocks. These shocks account for a large share of the fluctuations in consumption, GDP, and measured TFP and can be identified using shopping time data.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study markup cyclicality in a granular macroeconomic model with oligopolistic competition. We first characterize how firm, sectoral, and aggregate markups comove with output at different levels of aggregation in response to firm-level shocks. We then quantify the model’s ability to reproduce salient features of the cyclical properties of measured markups in French administrative firm-level data from the bottom (firm) level to the aggregate level. We document that (i) firm-level markups rise with market share and sector-level markups with concentration, (ii) the relationship between markups and sectoral output varies by firm size–negative for small firms but positive for large ones, (iii) sector-level markups move positively with sectoral output, and (iv) sectoral markups show no systematic relationship with aggregate output. Our model helps rationalize these seemingly conflicting patterns of markup cyclicality in the data.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Smarter Load Balancing with Fewer MessagesModern data centers rely on real-time information to route jobs efficiently—but constant communication between servers and load balancers can overwhelm the network. In their paper, “Load Balancing Using Sparse Communication,” Gal Mendelson and Kuang Xu present a breakthrough: high-performance load balancing using drastically fewer messages. They introduce a flexible framework based on state approximation and develop new algorithms and communication protocols that maintain near-optimal performance even when communication is sparse. The key insight is that servers can monitor how wrong the load balancer’s estimate is and communicate only when necessary. Their approach reduces communication by over 90% while sacrificing little quality, as proven through both theory and simulation. These results offer a scalable and practical solution for large service systems where bandwidth is precious.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, the management field has witnessed a surge in studies examining career success among workers from historically marginalized minority groups. However, to date, insights gained from this research remain fragmented and have not been integrated into the existing career success frameworks. We aim to complement career success scholarship and contribute to its inclusivity by conducting a systematic review that synthesizes the factors and pathways contributing to the career success of four historically underrepresented minority groups: women, racial and ethnic minorities, individuals with disabilities, and the LGBTQ+ community. Evidencing that career success disparity can be attributed to minority status, we propose a framework that highlights the career advancement and human and psychological resources associated with minority groups’ career success, as well as the systemic barriers limiting access to and use of such resources. We suggest hypervisibility, invisibility, and managed visibility as distinguishable forms of identity-based mechanisms that offer theoretical explanations for the influence of marginalized identity status on career success. Our framework integrates manifestations of subjective career success—accounting for survival, the collective good, and adjustability in addition to what extant literature has shown—emphasizing that membership in marginalized groups, communities, and other identity-relevant contexts shapes the subjective meaning of career success. Our review has practical implications for decision makers and organizations intending to bridge minority and nonminority groups’ career success disparity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While the corporate lingua franca mandate aims to facilitate communications among linguistically diverse employees, evidence shows that it creates more problems than it solves, often negatively affecting social integration and knowledge sharing in the workplace. Our study is driven by the phenomenon of high language diversity and low lingua franca proficiency, emerging characteristics of workplaces around the globe given increasing migration. We adopt a mixed-methods, longitudinal design involving participant observations, interviews, social network surveys, and company data. Our analysis revealed the existence and prevalence of an informal language advice network (LAN) in which individuals with varying levels of English proficiency actively engage in voluntary language-related knowledge-seeking and sharing. We found more positive interpersonal interactions and consequences of LAN than typically reported in extant studies. We leverage the social networks and generalized exchange literature to explain the processes and consequences of LAN for individuals and the organization. Management recognition was found to be important for sustaining LAN in a context of high language diversity. Our integrative analytical framework offers a valuable lens for scholarship on future workplaces that are being shaped by rapidly shifting ethnic, cultural, and linguistic demography.</content>

    <title>The effects of government debt on corporate borrowing in developing economies: evidence from Africa</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many African economies face high debt levels, yet local firms have unique growth opportunities requiring external financing. We examine whether government borrowing constrains corporate financing in Africa and how these effects differ by debt source. Using a manually collected dataset from 29 African countries (2000–2019), we uncover financing patterns that challenge conventional theories. In sharp contrast to firms in developed markets, we find that African firms experience a “crowding-in” effect when governments borrow externally, enhancing their access to debt. In contrast, domestic government borrowing induces the typical crowding-out effect, where government borrowing reduces corporate access to debt. The crowding-in phenomenon is most evident among publicly listed firms, particularly those cross-listed on foreign exchanges (the multinationals). The effect strengthens in countries with higher Eurobond market activity and intensifies following sovereign credit downgrades, underscoring the sovereign ceiling’s constraint on corporate borrowing. Our findings contribute significantly to international business literature by revealing how African debt markets function differently, highlighting unique financing challenges faced by African multinational enterprises, and demonstrating that economic principles established in developed markets cannot be universally applied to emerging economies. These insights are crucial for designing effective policies to support corporate growth in Africa.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An important global trend today is the rise of the secondhand market powered by consumers’ desire for sustainability and affordability, as well as a surge in the use of digital resale platforms. While marketing research has primarily focused on the success of new product markets, scant research has tried to understand secondhand markets. To advance knowledge in this area, we investigate how product design innovation affects the value of used products in secondhand markets. Specifically, we develop a framework of theintertemporal distinctiveness of a used product’s design, defined as the extent to which the design of a used product is distinct from the newest design of the same product. We use image-processing software to analyze product pictures and quantify the intertemporal distinctiveness of design. Analyzing a unique dataset of used cars sold in the U.S. automotive market, we find a U-shaped relationship between the intertemporal distinctiveness of design and the resale price of used products. Moreover, we find that the effect of intertemporal distinctiveness is moderated by thewithin-category distinctiveness of a used product, defined as the extent to which a used product’s design is distinct from other used products in the same product category. This study contributes to the research on product design and the determinants of resale prices, providing practical implications for consumers, manufacturers, and dealers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Optimal Bidding, Allocation, and Budget Spending for a Demand-Side Platform with Generic Auctions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a practical optimization model for the management of a demand-side platform (DSP), which is applicable in static planning situations where the DSP acquires valuable impressions for high-volume advertiser clients in a real-time bidding environment. We propose a highly flexible model for the DSP to maximize its profit while maintaining acceptable levels of budget spending for its advertisers. Our model achieves flexibility and improved performance primarily through two different aspects: (i) we replace standard budget constraints with a more general budget utilization proxy function over budget spending levels, and (ii) we can accommodate arbitrary auction types by directly modeling the interactions between the DSP and the auctions. Our proposed formulation leads to a non-convex optimization problem due to the joint optimization over both impression allocation and bid price decisions. Using Fenchel duality theory, we obtain a convex dual problem that can be efficiently solved with subgradient based algorithms and from which a primal solution may be recovered efficiently. Under a natural and intuitive "increasing marginal cost" condition, as well as under a more general condition, we show that there is zero duality gap between the dual problem and the original non-convex primal problem. Under the same conditions, we also demonstrate convergence of our algorithm to an optimal solution of the non-convex formulation as the dual problem is solved to near optimality. We conduct experiments on both synthetic data as well as data from a real DSP, and our results demonstrate how our algorithm allows the DSP to better trade off between profitability and budget spending as compared to a widely used "greedy" heuristic approach.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates a robust monopoly pricing problem, where a seller seeks tomaximize expected revenue when selling a product to a buyer with limited information, specifically knowing only the mean, variance, and asymmetric information (semivariance) of the buyer’s valuation distribution. We explore both deterministic and randomized pricing strategies and evaluate their performance under these constraints. We formulate two maximin problems aimed at maximizing the worst-case expected revenues. By employing the primal-dual approach in infinite linear programming, we derive the closed-form for the optimal pricing strategies for both maximin problems. Our results show that incorporating semivariance significantly enhances the performance of pricing strategies by better capturing distributional asymmetry. Additionally, we compare the performance of deterministic and randomized pricing in various scenarios, offering valuable insights into how risk and reward can be effectively balanced. Moreover, our results on both pricing strategies provide new bounds for the value of personalized pricing. This comprehensive analysis enables a deeper understanding of semivariance information to improve decision-making and offer practical insights for managing complex pricing decisions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The increasing prevalence of patent infringement litigation in recent decades has imposed significant costs on firms. This paper empirically examines how this legal risk influences a key operational decision: vertical integration. Drawing on the real options theory (ROT), we argue that managers reduce the extent of vertical integration to preserve flexibility and make operational adjustments in anticipation of unfavorable outcomes from patent lawsuits. Using a dataset of public firms and a text-based measure of vertical integration, our findings show that firms facing higher patent litigation risk are less vertically integrated. At the same time, these firms maintain broader supplier networks and product market scopes, consistent with a preference for leveraging market mechanisms to reduce the costs of exercising switch and exit options. The negative relationship between litigation risk and vertical integration is particularly pronounced in durable goods sectors and declining industries, where the ability to divest or halt operations is highly valued. Additionally, we find that firms diversify their supplier base and product and technology portfolios after facing patent lawsuits. However, more vertically integrated firms are slower to make these adjustments, suggesting that they encounter greater friction in exercising real options. Overall, our study highlights the significant role that intellectual property disputes play in shaping corporate vertical integration strategies.</content>

    <title>Robust Optimization with Decision-Dependent Information Discovery</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Robust optimization (RO) is a popular paradigm for modeling and solving two- and multistage decision-making problems affected by uncertainty. In many real-world applications, such as R&amp;D project selection, production planning, or preference elicitation for product or policy recommendations, the time of information discovery is decision-dependent and the uncertain parameters only become observable after an often costly investment. Yet, most of the literature on robust optimization assumes that the uncertain parameters can be observed for free and that the sequence in which they are revealed is independent of the decision-maker’s actions. To fill this gap in the practicability of RO, we consider two- and multistage robust optimization problems in which part of the decision variables control the time of information discovery. Thus, information available at any given time is decision-dependent and can be discovered (at least in part) by making strategic exploratory investments in previous stages. We propose a novel dynamic formulation of the problem and prove its correctness. We leverage our model to provide a solution method inspired from the K-adaptability approximation, whereby K candidate strategies for each decision stage are chosen here-and-now and, at the beginning of each period, the best of these strategies is selected after the uncertain parameters that were chosen to be observed are revealed. We reformulate the problem as a finite mixed-integer (resp. bilinear) program if none (resp. some) of the decision variables are real-valued. This finite program is solvable with off-the-shelf solvers. We generalize our approach to the minimization of piecewise linear convex functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of usability, optimality, and speed on synthetic instances of the Pandora box problem, the preference elicitation problem with real-valued recommendations, the best box problem, and the R&amp;D project portfolio optimization problem. Finally, we evaluate it on an instance of the active preference elicitation problem used to recommend kidney allocation policies to policy-makers at the United Network for Organ Sharing based on real data from the U.S. Kidney Allocation System.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: This work was supported primarily by the Operations Engineering Program of the National Science Foundation under NSF Award No. 1763108.

    <title>Beyond reductionism: rethinking MNEs’ role in environmental crises</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This counterpoint challenges the view advanced by Yu, Bansal, and Arjaliès (J Int Business Stud 54:1151–1169, 2023), who argue that multinational enterprises (MNEs), by virtue of their cross-border operations, are inherently detrimental to the environment. While Yu et al.’s call for responsible resource use is commendable, we contend that their framework oversimplifies the complex realities of international business (IB). Drawing on New Internalization Theory (NIT), we examine environmental crises through the lens of multilevel complexity—macro-level institutional interdependencies, firm-level heterogeneity, and individual-level cognitive and behavioral constraints. Our approach underscores the role of bounded rationality and bounded reliability across all relevant actors—not just MNE managers—in shaping environmental outcomes. We find that Yu et al.’s proposed strategies give limited attention to the institutional, industry, organizational, and governance conditions under which environmental value is created. By contrast, we apply comparative institutional analysis to investigate MNEs’ impact on the environment as compared to feasible, real-world alternatives. We argue that meaningful environmental progress hinges not on targeting MNEs, but on fostering multilateral coordination among public, private, and civil society actors, with MNEs being well positioned to lead such collaborations. We call for scholarship that avoids ideological overreach, embraces IB theory, and acknowledges MNEs as key agents in advancing environmental sustainability.</content>

    <title>Why (and When) Are Uncertain Price Promotions More Effective Than Equivalent Sure Discounts?</title>
    <updated>2025-06-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Past research suggests that offering customers a probabilistic promotion, such as an X% chance to get a product for free, is often more effective than providing a sure discount of equal expected value. In five studies (N = 8,969), we find that probabilistic price promotions are more effective than equivalent sure discounts only when those sure discounts are or seem trivial. Specifically, we find that probabilistic promotions are relatively more effective (1) when the sure discounts are actually smaller, (2) when the sure discounts are made to feel smaller by presenting them alongside a larger discount, and (3) when the sure discounts are made to feel smaller by framing them as a percentage discount rather than a dollar amount. These findings are inconsistent with two leading explanations of consumers’ preferences for probabilistic promotions—diminishing sensitivity and the overweighting of small probabilities—and suggest that people’s preferences for uncertainty are more strongly tethered to their perceptions of the size of the sure outcome than they are to their perceptions of the probability of getting the uncertain reward.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizational theory has predominantly studied elites, yielding significant insights but creating a narrow perspective on management practices and organizational dynamics. This essay argues that we can advance organizational theory by incorporating a comprehensive focus on populations marginalized across multiple dimensions—economic, educational, geographic, demographic, cultural, and social. Addressing these marginalized groups is crucial as they face barriers, stigma, and discrimination, which are often overlooked in elite-focused research. By bringing greater attention to marginalized populations and embracing an intersectional approach focused on multiple dimensions of marginalization, we have the opportunity to broaden the scope of management research, foster inclusivity, and better reflect the diverse realities of organizational life. This essay provides definitions, operationalizations, and exemplary articles for each dimension of marginalization, ultimately advocating a more comprehensive and inclusive perspective in organizational research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are increasingly facing decisions about operations in markets affected by geopolitical conflicts that attract global attention, but research that illuminates the consequences of these decisions remains scarce. We develop a theoretical framework that integrates rational expectations theory with the person-situation framework to explain how investors react to firms' operational decisions in such markets. Using Russia's war in Ukraine as our empirical context, we analyze 289 announcements by 237 firms publicly traded in the US and UK during the first month of the conflict. We find that firms announcing a suspension of their operations experience more negative short-term market reactions than firms announcing continued operations. However, these negative reactions are attenuated when suspensions are more anticipated due to prior competitor suspensions, higher public interest in the conflict, larger firm operational footprint in the affected market, and greater pre-conflict media attention focused on the focal firms. This framework provides important insights for managers faced with both market pressures and stakeholder expectations during geopolitical crises, as well as a theoretical basis for scholars to further examine the consequences of turmoil in firms’ international markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more autonomous and socially present, it is critical to understand how people accept AI not just as a technological tool, but also as an agent capable of (semi-)autonomous decision-making and interaction. With a meta-analysis of 287 effect sizes representing over 119,000 individuals, this research examines the factors driving human acceptance of AI. Through a dual-perspectives framework, AI as a tool versus an agent, the authors identify key AI characteristics, including capability, role, expertise scope, and anthropomorphism, that significantly influence acceptance. These engineerable AI characteristics, along with contextual and individual factors, form an AI-task-user framework that explains AI acceptance across different use scenarios and user groups. These findings contribute to the discourse on AI acceptance and human-AI interactions: revealing a small, decreasing reluctance to accept AI and, more importantly, directing future research to empirical testing and theory building of AI acceptance from an agentic perspective. This research also provides actionable user-centered design roadmap for practitioners to develop and communicate AI features that align with human expectations and enhance positive responses, especially at a time when agentic AI is rapidly becoming a technological and societal reality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite being preventable and curable, cervical cancer (CC) claimed 350,000 lives globally in 2024 due to the low adoption of CC screening (CCS). An analysis of the institutional context in India revealed a lack of awareness and disempowering sociocultural stigma and norms as two critical barriers. Simultaneously, trustworthy spokespersons emerged as key enablers of CCS adoption. Three incentive-compatible randomized field experiments were conducted to evaluate the fit and effectiveness of message sources (doctorsvs.peers) and appeal (informative, highlighting the disease’s mortality risk, vs.empowering, addressing health/CCS-related sociocultural taboos) on CCS adoption. While doctors and peers drive greater adoption than infographics when delivering informational messages, willingness to pay is highest for doctors. However, the highest adoption occurs when peers conveyempoweringmessages. The authors also find that doctors and peers reduce the price sensitivity for CCS, a preventive service, relative to infographics. The research underscores the importance of congruence between credible sources and context-specific message appeals in enhancing adoption. Policymakers can prioritize low-cost, context-specific interventions that address sociocultural barriers by using peers as credible messengers. In India alone, this approach could boost adoption by 36.5% and enable 21.07 million more women to undergo CCS.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While social entrepreneurs' pro‐social motivation and other‐oriented emotions often drive their collaborative efforts to tackle grand challenges like poverty or gender inequality in the Global South, we know little about how collective emotions shape Global South–North partnerships over time. Drawing on a comparative longitudinal study of two Ugandan‐German social enterprise partnerships with the joint goal of achieving the Southern partner's self‐reliance, we problematize how collective emotions may lead to various stages of collective emotional dependency and hence foster postcolonial repercussions. We introduce collective emotional dependency as an inherent micro‐level mechanism that may manifest, surface, and become (dis‐)embedded beyond macro‐level dependencies. Our findings illustrate the double‐edged nature of the collective emotions in each phase of the partnership, as they can be both beneficial and detrimental. Our study shows that longstanding power inequalities, which South–North social enterprise partnerships set out to reduce in the first place, remain present in the everyday relational practices of organizing and collaborating.</content>

    <title>Critical Management Studies: From One‐Dimensional Critique to Three‐Dimensional Scepticism</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Critical Management Studies (CMS) has largely relied on one‐dimensional critique which focus on the negation of a dominant social order. This strong focus has made the field increasingly stale and preoccupied with standard objects for critique. This paper suggests that if CMS is to move beyond these problems, it needs to develop three‐dimensional thinking, including understanding, questioning, and reparation. Drawing on the idea of ‘reparative critique’ (Sedgwick, 1997), we outline what this looks like in practice and how it might be done by practitioners of CMS. We argue that reparative critique involves three steps of understanding, developed through empirical inquiry relaxing assumptions and thick description, critique developed through exploring dilemmas and examining ironies, and reparation which is created through deflation and concept creation. By working through these three steps, we think it is possible for CMS to move beyond identifying the ‘dark side’ and begin to identify positive visions for the future of management.</content>

    <title>Keep Up the Good Work… or Else! Exploring Supervisor Responses to Quiet Quitting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A Google search of “quiet quitting” yields over 350 million results, which is remarkable given that the term is only a few years old. Although quiet quitting is a relatively new trend, the concept it describes—an employee's conscious decision to do the bare minimum in their job rather than going above and beyond—is familiar to researchers who have investigated organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). However, for those interested in the effective management of human resources, what is important—yet unknown—is how managers respond to employees who engage in quiet quitting. Therefore, in this conceptual paper, we use attribution theory to explore supervisor responses to employees who engage in quiet quitting and subsequently withhold OCB. We propose that supervisors will generally have negative reactions to employees' withholding OCB, but we further explain how evaluations of locus, controllability, and stability and principles of discounting and augmenting influence supervisor attributions. Finally, implications for human resource theory, research, and practice are discussed.</content>

    <title>Generational imprints: A contingency approach to corruption and entrepreneurship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing research offers conflicting evidence on how corruption affects entrepreneurship. We adopt a contingency approach highlighting the role of generational imprinting. Drawing on imprinting and generational research, we argue entrepreneurs develop distinct generational imprints shaped by the environment during their formative years. Using a proprietary dataset of Chinese private firms, our findings suggest that in corrupt environments, market‐generation entrepreneurs with a transactional imprint tend to outperform their premarket‐generation counterparts in the short run, as the latter's principled imprint likely limits public relations spending. Personal life experiences—rural living and higher education—attenuate the influence of the transactional imprint, narrowing intergenerational differences in firm performance. Our study advances research on corruption and entrepreneurship by integrating institutional, generational, and individual‐level perspectives to explain how corruption affects entrepreneurs differently.Managerial SummaryThe relationship between corruption and entrepreneurship remains contested. Our study takes a novel angle by examining generational differences among entrepreneurs. We suggest that the distinct environments entrepreneurs experienced during adolescence shape their value orientations, leading to variation in firm performance in corrupt environments. Using a dataset of Chinese private firms, we show that, in corrupt environments, younger‐generation entrepreneurs with a transactional orientation (i.e., transactional imprint) tend to outperform older‐generation entrepreneurs with a principled orientation (i.e., principled imprint) in the short run. However, this performance gap narrows among those who lived in rural areas or received higher education. Our work highlights the crucial role of institutional environments in shaping entrepreneurs' values across generations and advocates for initiatives that cultivate more ethically grounded entrepreneurial mindsets.</content>

    <title>Paying off the Competition: Contracting, Market Power, and Innovation Incentives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores the relationship between a firm’s legal contracting environment and its innovation incentives. Using granular data from the pharmaceutical industry, we examine a contracting mechanism through which incumbents maintain market power: “pay-for-delay” agreements to delay the market entry of competitors. Exploiting a shock where such contracts become legally tenuous, we find that affected incumbents subsequently increase their innovation activity across a variety of project-level measures. Exploring the nature of this innovation, we also find that it is more “impactful” from a scientific and commercial standpoint. The results provide novel evidence that restricting the contracting space can boost innovation at the firm level. However, at the extensive margin we find a reduction in innovation by new entrants in response to increased competition, suggesting a nuanced effect on aggregate innovation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a comprehensive dataset of privacy policies, firm characteristics, consumer tracking, and cybersecurity incidents, we document several stylized facts about the heterogeneity of firms’ data extraction practices and the influence of privacy regulations. Rather than adopting standardized boilerplate privacy policies, we find substantial within-industry differences correlated with firms’ technical sophistication; firms engaging in data extraction have lengthier policies, seeking to hedge legal risks. Firms with intermediate technical sophistication appear to follow a “collect and share” model, collecting large amounts of consumer data and sharing it with third parties for processing, thus creating cybersecurity risks. Conversely, high sophistication firms appear to implement a “receive and process” model, consistent with a two-tier data market in which data flow from intermediate to high sophistication firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Observed international investment positions and cross-country heterogeneity in rates of return to capital are hard to reconcile with frictionless capital markets. In this paper, we develop a theory of international capital allocation: a multi-country dynamic spatial general equilibrium model in which the entire network of cross-border investment is endogenously determined. Our model features cross-country heterogeneity in fundamental risk, a demand system for international assets, and frictions that cause segmentation in international capital markets. We measure frictions affecting international investment and apply our model to data from nearly 100 countries, using a new dataset of international capital taxes and cultural, linguistic, and geographic distances between countries (geopoliticaldistance.org). Our model performs well in reproducing the composition of international portfolios, the cross-section of home bias and rates of return to capital, and other key features of international capital markets. Finally, we carry out counterfactual exercises: we show that barriers to international investment reduce world output by 7% and raise the cross-country dispersion of capital per employee, contributing in a meaningful way to global inequality.</content>

    <title>Disclosing Low Product Availability: An Online Platform’s Strategy for Mitigating Stockout Risk</title>
    <updated>2025-06-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ensuring product availability and successful order fulfillment are critical priorities for any retail company. In this paper, we explore how sharing information about low-availability items (LAIs) can influence customer purchase decisions both in preventing stockouts and mitigating their negative effects. The net impact of sharing information on LAIs is difficult to predict ex ante because multiple effects may act in opposite directions. On the one hand, sharing information could discourage LAI purchases from customers who are averse to stockouts. On the other hand, such information might increase the demand for LAIs because of cognitive biases that make scarce items seem more appealing. In a field experiment with more than 840,000 Instacart customers, we first find that customers are 25% less likely to purchase LAIs when item availability information is disclosed. This effect is not uniform; it is more pronounced when customers shop at new stores, when they have previously encountered lower found rates on the platform, and when they have less experience using the platform. Importantly, LAI disclosure has a positive impact on the platform’s performance in both the short and long term. Specifically, this innovative and extremely low-cost policy results in a 5.8% increase in customer spending and a 5.7% increase in order frequency over the long term. Our analysis suggests that this positive effect is driven by several factors: the improved service quality experienced by customers, as evidenced by a 3.7% reduction in refunds, a 2.9% decrease in product replacements, and a 7.5% reduction in poor product replacement ratings when replacements do occur; increased customer exploration of different stores; and higher spending per order because of fewer refunds and the exploration of potentially more expensive product substitutes. In the context of online retail, a policy of disclosing LAIs can improve customer decision-making by providing stock information, reduce stockouts, enhance satisfaction by managing expectations and transparency, and promote exploration of more platform options.This paper was accepted by Victor Martinez de Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01808 .</content>

    <title>Volatility During the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of COVID-19 on market volatility in an equilibrium framework. The model combines beliefs-dependent preferences for economic dynamics and a stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased (SEIRD) model with unpredictable birth/vaccine events and mitigating policies for disease propagation. The estimated model explains the realized trajectories of the S&amp;P 500 volatility and number of new cases and identifies the source and composition of the volatility spike while providing a good match for 25 unconditional moments of economic series. Beliefs dependence, in conjunction with real effects due to the short-term decline of the effective workforce early in the pandemic, is critical for this comprehensive explanation of short- and long-run properties. A model comparison study is performed. Out-of-sample volatility prediction exercises document that the good in-sample model fit for volatility and cases is not due to over-parametrization. The effects of alternative mitigation policies such as changes in contamination rate, shelter-in-place duration, and shelter-in-place compliance rate are examined. They document the tradeoff in number of cases and stock volatility during the pandemic, and the dominant role of unemployment news volatility.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04352 .</content>

    <title>Financial/Social Trade‐Offs in Dual‐Purpose Companies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dual‐purpose companies (DPCs) encounter numerous financial and social trade‐offs in their operations. However, existing research has not fully explored the heterogeneity and antecedents of these trade‐offs. To bridge this gap, we first distinguish between scenarios in which trade‐offs are mitigated or intensified, and then categorize the intensification into two directions: social dominance and financial dominance. We hypothesize that unique combinations of governance arrangements and organizational capabilities result in different trade‐off scenarios. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a fsQCA of 46 subsidiaries within a Chinese state‐owned enterprise group. We identify three patterns that mitigate trade‐offs and three patterns that intensify them. The findings highlight the complex interplay between governance mechanisms and organizational capabilities related to different trade‐off scenarios, and the diverse pathways towards trade‐off mitigation, and the causal asymmetry between patterns of different trade‐off scenarios. Overall, this study advances our understanding of the heterogeneity of financial/social trade‐offs in DPCs.</content>

    <title>ESG Rating Competition and Rating Quality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how increased competition among environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rating agencies relates to ESG rating quality. We exploit the entry of Sustainalytics as a new ESG rating agency in 2010. We conduct a difference‐in‐differences analysis and provide three main findings. First, we find that higher competition decreases incumbents' ESG rating disagreements of the same scope. The negative relation between competition and ESG rating disagreement persists for same‐scope rating metrics not covered by Sustainalytics, suggesting that neither learning nor herding drive the results. The relationship between competition and rating disagreement strengthens for firms with more ESG disclosures, which generally require more effort to analyze. Second, we find that incumbents' ratings of ESG concerns are more strongly associated with future negative ESG news for firms additionally covered by Sustainalytics. This finding is consistent with competition improving ratings' ability to predict future negative ESG incidents. Third, we find that incumbents evaluate more difficult‐to‐measure outcome metrics for firms covered by Sustainalytics, consistent with competition inducing more effort. Overall, our findings suggest that competition serves as an implicit disciplining mechanism of ESG rating agencies' quality.</content>

    <title>Data Donations for Digital Contact Tracing: Short- and Long-Term Effects of Monetary Incentives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractData donations promise to unlock the social benefits of personal data. Recently, contact-tracing apps were developed to collect data from individuals to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Because the success of these apps depends on widespread adoption and continuous data collection, we evaluate the effectiveness of monetary incentive mechanisms at promoting verified installations of the German Corona-Warn-App and short- and long-term data donations. We find monetary incentives are effective in the short term: They significantly increase app installations and short-term data donations, tripling the number of data donors after 14 days compared to no compensation. However, the positive stimulus of monetary incentives vanishes in the long term: After eight months, installers in treatments with monetary incentives are significantly more likely to have stopped donating data than intrinsically motivated installers who did not receive monetary incentives, as a consequence of experienced opportunity costs and a lack of perceived benefits. Consequently, long-term data donation rates are not significantly higher in treatments with monetary incentives. This suggests one-time payments are ineffective at promoting long-term data donations, as the short-term crowding-in of less intrinsically motivated installers is difficult to sustain when passive app usage limits opportunities for habit formation and convincing users of contact-tracing benefits.</content>

    <title>To Split or to Merge? How Partitioning Affects Consumption and Engagement with Digital Content</title>
    <updated>2025-06-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study reveals how partitioning serialized e-books into many short episodes (small partitioning (SP)) or fewer but lengthier segments (large partitioning (LP)) shapes reading behavior and economic outcomes. Using actual consumption data, we find that SP fosters higher total word consumption but can reduce overall progression through a title. Conversely, LP boosts completion rates, encourages deeper engagement through annotations and reviews, and spurs subsequent purchases. These positive effects are stronger when a book is popular or high in quality. Our results challenge the conventional view that shorter episodes automatically increase user attention, highlighting the need for a tailored approach. Stakeholders can implement LP for well-regarded or lengthy titles to maximize reader satisfaction and stimulate both reviews and further sales. Smaller partitions, however, might be beneficial for shorter works under a pay-per-word scheme or for certain audience preferences. By aligning partitioning strategies with content characteristics, publishers and platform owners can maintain robust consumer engagement, manage possible drawbacks of segmentation, and support sustainable growth. This research provides clear, actionable insights for digital publishing professionals seeking to optimize user experiences and drive profitability. These findings also encourage further inquiry into how partitioning strategies interact with rapidly evolving consumer preferences and reading technologies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Short-form video platforms such as TikTok and Douyin are widely used but have sparked serious concerns about their impact on youth mental health, especially suicidal thoughts. This study introduces a novel knowledge-guided neural topic model that predicts a video’s potential to induce suicidal thoughts in viewers at the time of upload. Unlike existing models, our approach integrates medical knowledge on suicide risk factors with user-generated content to improve prediction accuracy and explainability. Tested on real-world data from two major platforms, the model not only outperforms current machine learning and deep learning benchmarks but also uncovers emerging content themes linked to suicidal thought risk. For practice, this tool can be directly integrated into platforms’ content moderation pipelines, identifying high-risk videos for follow-up human review before harm spreads. For policy, it offers a scalable and ethically informed method to mitigate digital risks to youth mental health, balancing user safety with content creator rights. This work offers a critical step forward in responsible AI and public mental health protection in the era of algorithm-driven media.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides evidence that the U.S. dollar affects trade through a financial channel of the exchange rate. Using global data over three decades, we show that dollar appreciation increases import prices and decreases import quantities for non-U.S. dollar countries. In line with a financial channel, these effects are stronger when the exporting country borrows more in U.S. dollars abroad. The financial channel was active before the global financial crisis, has strengthened since, and operates independently of the dominant currency invoicing channel. Instrumenting the dollar is key to uncovering the full effect of the financial channel. (JEL G12, G31)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that most dispersion in marginal revenue products of inputs occurs across plants within firms rather than between firms. This is commonly thought to reflect misallocation: dispersion is “bad”. However, we show that eliminating frictions hampering internal capital markets in a multi-plant firm model may in fact increase productivity dispersion and raise output: dispersion can be “good”. This arises as firms optimally stagger investment activity across their plants over time to avoid raising costly external finance, instead relying on reallocating internal funds. The staggering in turn generates dispersion in marginal revenue products. We use U.S. Census data on multi-plant manufacturing firms to provide empirical evidence for the model mechanism and show a quantitatively important role for good dispersion. Since there is less scope for good dispersion in emerging economies, the difference in the degree of misallocation between emerging and developed economies looks more pronounced than previously thought.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When inferring causal effects from correlational data, a common practice by professional researchers but also lay people is to control for potential confounders. Inappropriate controls produce erroneous causal inferences. I model decision-makers who use endogenous observational data to learn actions’ causal effect on payoff-relevant outcomes. Different decision-maker types use different controls. Their resulting choices affect the very correlations they learn from, thus calling for equilibrium analysis of the steady-state welfare cost of bad controls. I obtain tight upper bounds on this cost. Equilibrium forces drastically reduce it when types’ sets of controls contain one another.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the prevalence of online review creation and solicitation, this paper examines whether posting an online review impacts the reviewer’s future spending on the reviewed brand. Identifying the causal effects of posting an online review is challenging because reviewers self-select into posting, making it an endogenous decision. I overcome this challenge by using randomized online review solicitations as an instrument for the endogenous treatment variable of posting an online review and establish that doing so decreases the average future spending by the reviewers on the reviewed brand. Additionally, I show that soliciting customers to post increases their propensity to write a review and thus in turn reduces their average future spending on the solicited brand. From a managerial standpoint, this finding suggests that online review solicitations can backfire, decreasing the average future spending by solicited customers. I therefore investigate whether the impact of posting (and hence soliciting) is heterogeneous with respect to customer satisfaction and loyalty. At the highest satisfaction level, posting does not change future spending regardless of customer loyalty. However, posting has a detrimental impact on future spending by dissatisfied reviewers. These adverse effects of posting emerge in the most loyal customers as soon as their satisfaction deviates from a perfect score (despite writing a positive review) and carry over to their future spending, even on nonreviewed brands of the company. Based on my findings, I present a set of guidelines for managers to follow when soliciting online reviews and responding to reviewers.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1 grant [Grant C207MSS20B006].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01951 .</content>

    <title>Search or Scroll: How Credibility Versus Likability Premiums Shape Consumer Following Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers’ choices of whom to follow on digital platforms shape their informational landscape. In an era where the credibility of informational sources is critical, this research examines two key questions: (1) When do consumers prioritize communicator credibility over likability in their decisions to follow? and (2) How do multiple credibility and likability cues interact to influence these decisions? Analyzing four large datasets from popular following-enabled platforms, we find consumers’ orientation towards content consumption—goal-directed (“search”) versus experiential (“scroll”)—is key. Communicator credibility drives following on search-driven platforms (Yelp, Goodreads), while likability drives following on scroll-driven ones (Twitter/X, Instagram). Aggregate communicator sentiment across multiple posts serves as a cross-platform indicator of credibility and likability, and its effect on follower-count differs by platform type. On scroll-driven platforms, communicators with positive aggregate sentiment benefit from a likeability premium, attracting the most followers; this preference for positivity is mitigated by the presence of alternative communicator likeability cues (e.g., using sociable language). On search-driven platforms, communicators with mixed aggregate sentiment benefit from a credibility premium, attracting the most followers; this preference for mixed sentiment is mitigated in the presence of alternative credibility cues (e.g., Yelp’s “Elite” badge). Implications for consumer protection and platform design are discussed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As electric vehicles (EVs) become more widespread, cities face the growing challenge of managing charging demand without overloading the grid. This study presents a novel information systems (IS) solution that supports smart and sustainable EV integration. The authors develop a capacity-based pricing model that adjusts in real time based on charging rates and grid capacity. Unlike many existing approaches, it avoids “avalanche effects” where synchronized charging behavior creates new demand peaks. The presented solution is also computationally efficient, making it practical for real-world use. Evaluated through simulations based on realistic urban scenarios, the model reduces demand volatility, aligns EV charging with renewable energy availability, and maintains overall charging costs for users. This work offers policy makers and energy providers a concrete tool to balance environmental goals with energy system reliability. For urban mobility planners, it provides a scalable, adaptive method to support the transition to cleaner urban mobility.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most research on family demands has been conducted at the individual level, showing that they can negatively influence employees' abilities to manage the work‐family interface. We challenge this existing paradigm by arguing that at the team level, family demands diversity (i.e., differences among members of the same team with respect to their family demands) can enable the entire team to better manage the work‐family interface. Drawing on the categorization‐elaboration model and social exchange theory, we found that family demands diversity was indirectly and positively related to team effort through team backup behavior and team work‐to‐family conflict, and these effects were stronger when team family identity was low and supervisor family support was high. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings and the practical implications for HR policies and practices.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Advance Multi-Priority, Multi-Appointment Patient Scheduling with Dependent Demand and Lead Times</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines a patient scheduling problem with multiple appointment types and priority levels, where certain appointments must precede others and lead times play a crucial role. Although both factors significantly influence the quality of care—particularly when specialist assessments depend on timely diagnostic tests—they have been largely overlooked in existing healthcare scheduling models. To address this gap, we propose a dynamic scheduling model that explicitly incorporates appointment dependencies, lead times, and patient heterogeneity across multiple priority levels. The model reflects the real-world complexities of coordinating diagnostic and consult appointments in time-sensitive clinical settings. Using Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) techniques, we develop an Approximate Optimal Policy (AOP) that efficiently allocates clinical resources, minimizes patient wait times, and ensures the availability of test results prior to consult appointments.We further derive a closed-form solution for the optimal approximation parameters, supported by a mathematical proof, which offers significant computational advantages. We evaluate the performance of the proposed AOP through simulation and compare it against a set of benchmark policies, including heuristics adapted from existing scheduling logic and current clinical practice. The solution is applied to a case study created based on data from a Stroke Prevention Clinic (SPC), where the complexity of care protocols and high demand present substantial scheduling challenges. The results demonstrate that the AOP consistently outperforms all benchmarks in terms of reducing wait times, ensuring timely diagnostic completion before consults, and meeting wait-time targets. We also introduce a practical, easy-to-implement heuristic called (MSP), which is derived from the AOP and designed for operational use. While simpler in structure, MSP performs comparably well and is well-suited for adoption in real healthcare settings due to its interpretability and minimal computational requirements. Finally, although the proposed approach is demonstrated in the context of an SPC, it has broader applicability to other areas such as cancer care, kidney transplant scheduling, and other complex care pathways involving interdependent appointments and prioritization.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Improving the Spatial Fairness of Spatiotemporal Sequence Forecasting Service Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Spatial unfairness in spatiotemporal forecasting tasks can lead to critical issues, e.g., inefficient resource allocation during pandemics or air pollution crises, exacerbating the spread of diseases or increasing exposure to pollution. The existing fair forecasting methods often struggle with spatiotemporal data that lack clear sensitive attributes and exhibit dynamic complexity. A pseudogrouping adversarial machine learning method that combines a spatiotemporal clustering-based pseudogrouping generator with an auxiliary classifier-based adversarial learning framework is proposed in this paper. The proposed pseudogrouping strategy identifies and labels hidden sensitive attributes, enabling fair forecasting models to effectively handle explicit sensitive attributes. Moreover, the existing adversarial learning methods are enhanced in this paper to accommodate the complex dynamics between the features and sensitive attributes contained in the input data. The proposed model is evaluated on three real-world datasets (pandemic, PM2.5, and traffic flow data) and is benchmarked against five existing models using three fairness metrics and three accuracy metrics. The experimental results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing fairness-focused models in terms of accuracy while maintaining fairness, and it markedly improves upon the fairness of accuracy-focused models without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, we examine the impact of a fairer forecasting model on the resource allocation process conducted during a pandemic by employing two types of fair resource allocation models. The numerical results derived from the mean–deviation tradeoff model show that using the forecasts obtained from our model can enhance both the efficiency and fairness of allocations when fairness is prioritized during decision-making. When efficiency is prioritized, the forecasting procedure of the proposed model yields improved allocation efficiency, albeit at the cost of reduced fairness. Additionally, results obtained from the α-fairness model indicate that the proposed fair forecasting model consistently outperforms the benchmark across diverse resource allocation objectives, especially when prioritizing one of fairness or efficiency. The findings of this study provide crucial insights into the fairness of forecasting algorithms, illustrating how the introduction of a pseudogrouping strategy and an enhanced adversarial learning framework can significantly improve the fairness of predictive algorithms.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Value of Flexibility in Robust Supply Chain Network Design</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A supply chain network design problem (SCNDP) involves making long-term, irreversible strategic decisions whose cost efficiency depends on effectively leveraging flexibility and demand information. After analyzing the interaction of these factors, we propose five distinct policies for addressing the SCNDP. Starting with a localized production model where demand is satisfied locally, the study extends to scenarios where production capacity at one location serves other nodes (Policy II). Further flexibility is introduced by enabling capacity sharing among facilities with prearranged links (Policy III). Unlike these policies, which optimize capacities as proxies for production decisions prior to demand realization, Policies IV and V defer production decisions until demand is realized. The robustness and resilience of these policies are evaluated under varying levels of demand uncertainty and risks of supply disruptions. To provide actionable insights, we develop robust two-stage optimization frameworks for the proposed policies and design efficient methods to address varying uncertainty budgets for both supply and demand risks. Our results reveal that under demand uncertainty alone: (i) Capacity-sharing links among facilities yield the highest cost savings across all uncertainty budgets due to the pooling effect and significantly reduce shortage probability (Policy III), and (ii) Production postponement offers only marginal benefits, highlighting the greater importance of upstream capacity-sharing over postponing production, particularly for moderate uncertainty budgets. Under simultaneous demand and supply risks, we demonstrate that (iii) capacity-sharing retains its value, while flexibility from production postponement deteriorates performance, favoring partially flexible networks with only capacity-sharing links over fully flexible ones with both sources of flexibility. To contextualize these findings, we apply the most effective policies to a real-world case study, quantifying their impact and providing design recommendations. Finally, we extend our models to an event-wise ambiguity set and demonstrate that by (iv) leveraging the supermodular structure of the second-stage problems, one can solve instances up to eight times larger.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Driven by climate change and overuse, water stress is a worsening sustainability concern that threatens businesses and communities across the globe. Leading global organizations such as the United Nations have expressed an urgent need for sustainable water management strategies across nations and economies. Yet, the field of supply chain management does not have a substantial research stream related to water. A key challenge is the lack of a persuasive organizing framework within this setting. This study presents a systematic literature review of water stress from a supply chain perspective. Literature spanning over two decades across an array of journals is synthesized into an overarching framework that organizes topics related to water. Challenges firms face due to operational and contextual water risks are presented. Based on the proposed framework, research gaps for further exploration of the relationship between supply chains and water stress are suggested.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the last decade and recently, a wide range of industries and organizations have been subject to IT-related security threats and cybersecurity breaches of varying degrees of severity at an alarming rate. A common practice adopted by organizations to ensure system and network security is to conduct regular audits and assessments. This paper takes on an organizational strategy perspective to analytically model the cost impact of random breaches in various types of networks subject to different types of audit policy. The analysis focuses on the interplay between the cost associated with a security breach on the one hand, and audit policy on the other. We develop a model for a non-stationary stochastic arrival process of security breaches and analyze the impact on mean and variance of total cost of different network configurations and audit policies. The generality of our modeling of the arrival process and the cost function permits a variety of attack and cost landscapes to be modeled and analyzed, with different breach intensities and costs (as functions of time) leading to different recommendations in terms of effective audit policy. Our analysis highlights the impact of intensity of security breach and cost of breach on the interaction between different network configurations and audit policies. One of our counter-intuitive findings is that under high security threat conditions a centralized network has a lower mean as well as a lower variance of total cost than a decentralized network, in case of cyclic and random audits; this analytically derived proposition is an interesting instance of adual risk-pooling effectthat goes beyond conventional risk-pooling. We extend our analysis to consider an asymmetric network and correlated breaches.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Online Venting: the Impact of Temporal Proximity Cues and Emotionality on Perceptions of Negative Online Review Value</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Because negative reviews have the potential to dissuade consumers, brands necessarily worry about them. Prior literature generally supports the notion that negative information offers greater value to and influences consumers more powerfully, yet in specific circumstances, negative online reviews might be less helpful and influential. As the current research establishes, when negative reviews exhibit near (vs. far) temporal proximity cues, relative to a reviewed experience with a product or service,andsome degree of negative emotionality, consumers tend to discount them in their decision-making. Such outcomes seemingly arise because consumers identify a negative review that combines near temporal proximity (i.e., posted or written in a way that makes the experience feel temporally close) with negative emotionality as a form of “venting.” They then ascribe the information in the negative review to reviewer-related rather than to relevant product or service quality attributes. Consistent evidence for this venting discount effect emerges from analyses of actual hotel reviews from TripAdvisor, as well as multiple experimental studies, involving both products and services.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Millions of eligible lower-income people do not apply for government benefits. Increasing interest in applying for these benefits is a crucial concern for marketers and economists, as the underutilization of benefits limits their effectiveness. This research proposes thatexpenditure reframes, descriptions translating monetary amounts into expense categories, can increase interest in government benefits. Expenditure reframes enhance a benefit’s psychological value, helping consumers better understand its impact on their financial lives. Evidence from a large-scale preregistered field experiment (N= 14,267) aimed at encouraging lower-income individuals to claim a tax credit demonstrates that expenditure reframe messages increased interest, increasing visits to the claiming website. A second preregistered large-scale field experiment among Medicaid recipients (N= 71,939) identifies a boundary condition for the effect of expenditure reframes on interest. A third preregistered large-scale field experiment replicates the efficacy of expenditure reframes (N= 36,081) and highlights how the expense type featured in the reframe moderates these effects. Results from three preregistered online experiments support these findings and further elucidate the impact of expenditure reframes on psychological value. This work underscores how marketers, practitioners, and policymakers shape perceptions of government benefits and illustrates key considerations for designing effective outreach campaigns targeting lower-income households.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite firms’ emphasis on product visual aesthetics (PVA) for competitive advantage, questions remain regarding which aesthetic properties enhance PVA the most, the strength of PVA’s effect on consumer responses, and moderating factors. To address these gaps, the authors conduct a meta-analysis of 727 effect sizes from 263 independent samples spanning 1993-2024. Findings reveal that both organizational and meaningful aesthetic properties positively impact PVA, with harmony being the strongest property. PVA positively influences both consumer attitudes and behaviors. The authors develop a comprehensive framework of moderators across five key groups: brand, product, communication, consumer, and environmental factors. The moderator analyses yield multiple important insights and (1) identify economic growth and consumption publicity as particularly influential; (2) recognize previously unexplored but relevant moderators (e.g., aesthetic object type, individualism, and income inequality); (3) clarify debated moderators (e.g., brand familiarity, product quality level, and gender); (4) reveal that certain moderator combinations can turn PVA effects negative. For instance, focusing on packaging aesthetics with utilitarian, private, non-durable, and low-quality products can turn the effect of PVA on attitudes negative; and (5) find an attitude-behavior gap in the moderating effects of PVA. The study provides new insights into the nuanced effects of PVA for effective application.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to transform how brands communicate with consumers. Recent research demonstrates AI’s benefits in producing text, but marketing research has not yet explored how marketers can leverage AI to create visual advertising. Despite their impressive capabilities, “off the shelf” generative AI models are not aligned with marketing objectives, raising the question whether fine-tuning generative AI directly on conventional advertising objectives like evoking attention or driving interest is possible. In this research, we train an open-source generative AI model on marketing mindset metrics and show that the resulting visual content can match and even exceed conventionally produced advertising content in associated performance metrics. We also demonstrate that generative AI can be fine-tuned on multiple communication objectives simultaneously and adapted to specific audiences. In addition to highlighting generative AI’s potential in marketing, we probe the limitations of aligning visual generative AI with marketing objectives.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Through an abductive qualitative case study of a Colombian peacebuilding NGO, we explore how social intermediaries facilitate the integration of fragmented ex‐combatant and campesino communities. Our analysis reveals a three‐stage process by which the social intermediary simultaneously engages in enterprise‐focused and community‐focused activities to transform loosely connected ‘communities of circumstance’ into tightly integrated ‘communities of choice’. First, the intermediary uses ‘dirty boots’ to establish itself as a trusted,shared relationshipbetween communities. It then employs an ‘accompaniment’ approach to cultivateshared spaces,shared practices, andshared interestsamong community members engaging in collective entrepreneurial activities. Finally, it shifts to ‘distant friends’ as it encourages communities to embrace ashared futuretogether. By clarifying how intermediaries can use entrepreneurship as a force for community integration, particularly within necessity contexts of conflict and poverty, we contribute to research on social intermediaries, communities, and entrepreneurship as a tool to address grand challenges.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Chatbots are now able to engage in sophisticated conversations with consumers in the domain of relationships, providing a potential coping solution to widescale societal loneliness. Behavioral research provides little insight into whether these applications are effective at alleviating loneliness. We address this question by focusing on “AI companions”: applications designed to provide consumers with synthetic interaction partners. Study 1 examines user reviews of AI companion apps and finds correlational evidence suggesting that these apps help alleviate loneliness. Study 2 finds that AI companions successfully alleviate loneliness on par only with interacting with another person, and more than other activities such as watching YouTube videos. Moreover, consumers underestimate the degree to which AI companions improve their loneliness. Study 3 uses a longitudinal design and finds that an AI companion consistently provides momentary reductions in loneliness after use over the course of a week. Study 4 provides evidence that both the chatbots’ performance and, especially, whether it makes users feel heard, explain reductions in loneliness. Study 5 provides an additional robustness check for the loneliness-alleviating benefits of AI companions and shows that self-disclosure and distraction alone do not explain AI companions’ effectiveness.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct an experiment to investigate the use of peer evaluations for compensation purposes. Although organizations often rely on peer evaluations for incentive compensation, it is not well understood how peer feedback should be used and designed to ensure non‐distorted evaluations and motivate effort provision. We study peer evaluations in form of bonus allocation proposals, thereby enabling a quantifiable test of our hypothesis. We distinguish between discretionary use (i.e., allocation by the manager) and formulaic use (i.e., allocation by the team via the average) of self‐including and self‐excluding proposals. We find that, relative to self‐including proposals, self‐excluding proposals are less distorted, irrespective of use, but lead to more effort provision only under formulaic use. Under discretionary use, the benefits of self‐excluding proposals are offset, as managerial biases enter bonus allocations. In sum, our findings illustrate benefits of delegating bonus allocations to teams through formulaic use of self‐excluding peer evaluations and extend the understanding of how organizations can effectively incorporate peer evaluations into incentive compensation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine firms' trade‐offs in their voluntary disclosure decisions following negative media coverage of climate change incidents. By combining a keyword discovery algorithm and a fine‐tuned BERT model, we identify “hard” and “soft” climate disclosures on Twitter. Our findings indicate that firms tend to issue climate tweets as a rapid response to negative climate incidents. Additionally, firms with a history of hard climate change disclosure, as measured by ESG reports, are more likely to issue climate‐related responses than firms without such a history. Furthermore, we show that prior hard disclosure is associated with hard responses when the incident receives moderate media attention, but with soft responses when the incident receives low media attention. Our findings provide empirical insights for dynamic disclosure theory by illustrating how prior disclosure shapes firms' response strategies to negative media coverage.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Network agency matters in entrepreneurship. As purposeful agents, entrepreneurs actively interact with their surroundings. However, scholars only have limited and dispersed knowledge about the antecedents, mechanisms, and outcomes of entrepreneurs’ network agency. We performed an integrative review of network agency in entrepreneurship to provide a much-needed synthesis of the fragmented insights into this topic. By moving away from a deterministic approach in which social structures shape entrepreneurs’ destinies and toward an agentic approach in which social networks shape entrepreneurs while simultaneously being shaped, managed, and developed by them, we contribute to a refined understanding of social networks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite growing interest in serendipity in entrepreneurship, its antecedents, contingencies, and outcomes remain understudied. We find that new firms with a monochronic orientation—a preference for handling tasks sequentially—experience more serendipity, which in turn enhances innovation performance. This is amplified in dynamic environments, where unexpected discoveries are more likely to generate value. Challenging assumptions that systematic search and broad information inputs drive innovation, our study highlights focused attention as a driver of serendipity. By linking serendipity to strategic attention allocation and environmental conditions, we offer insights into how firms can foster and capitalize on unexpected discoveries to drive innovation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurial experimentation is the process by which entrepreneurs design, conduct, and interpret tests of cause-and-effect relationships in order to learn and reduce uncertainty, risk, and doubt associated with new venture development. Research suggests entrepreneurial experimentation is essential to the entrepreneurial journey. Yet, this research remains fragmented, resulting in conceptual ambiguity. In this article, we review and synthesize the scholarly literature on entrepreneurial experimentation from 1985 to 2024. In so doing, we synthesize this literature into a definition, conceptual foundations, and an integrative theoretical framework. We conclude with a future research agenda that explores more nuance, contingencies, and sociocultural dynamics.</content>

    <title>The Distribution of Investor Beliefs, Stock Ownership, and Stock Returns</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the relationship between the distribution of investor beliefs, the breadth of ownership, and expected returns in a model where stocks differ in the intensity of disagreement and in the extent to which beliefs are polarized, as measured by the number of optimists and pessimists relative to moderates. Polarization explains the size-dependent relationship between breadth and expected returns that we find empirically: positive for large stocks and negative for small stocks. We also find empirical support for the underlying mechanism: polarized stocks earn lower expected returns and are held more broadly if small and less broadly if large.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the Comunidad de Madrid [Programa Excelencia para el Profesorado Universitario, Convenio con Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, V Plan Regional de Investigacion Cientifica e Innovacion Tecnologica], the LSE Paul Woolley Centre, and the Spanish National Research Council [Grant PID2019-111358GB-I00].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02027 .</content>

    <title>Better Than Myself: A Translation and Extension of Internal Comparison Theories in Management</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social comparison theory (SCT) is ubiquitous and underlies much of modern management research. However, in addition to comparing ourselves externally to similar others, educational and social psychologists study how internal comparisons affect children. Internal comparison theories (ICTs) fall into two categories that include (a) temporal comparisons, that is, comparisons between our current self-evaluation and a past or future evaluation; and (b) dimensional comparisons, that is, comparisons between our evaluation in one dimension (e.g., teaching skills) to our evaluation on another dimension (e.g., research skills). We compare tenets of ICTs and SCT and present novel theoretical propositions around these tenets, and show how they differentially impact affective, behavioral, and cognitive identity work. Additionally, we offer future directions for how theorizing could be expanded on core internal comparison theories, as well as how ICTs could be used as a theoretical framework for research on identity, stress and well-being, justice, leadership, emotions, and social hierarchy.</content>

    <title>Comparing Learning-by-Doing Between In-House Provision and External Contracting in Public Service Provision</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Studies of organizational learning show that experience enables firms to utilize specific governance structures effectively. Nevertheless, little attention has been given to comparing the effects of learning-by-doing across different structures. In this paper we investigate whether the duration of operation influences performance differently in two structures utilized in public services: in-house provision and external contracting. An analysis of water supply data in France from 1998 to 2008 suggests that the learning advantages are greater in external contracting due to its high-powered incentives, but these benefits decrease as the technological complexity and environmental uncertainty of public services increase. We contribute to organizational learning theory, extend research on governance structures, and provide critical insights into the sustainable management of natural resources.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a specific practice of predatory lending: Borrowers being rejected and approved in rapid succession by the same lender. We show that in such cases borrower and contract characteristics and ex post performance are consistent with predatory steering. Steered borrowers are associated with groups with lower financial sophistication. They are more likely to enter non-amortizing contracts with high profit margins that are quickly securitized. Steered borrowers default less in boom years when refinancing is easy. However, their performance deteriorates sharply once falling prices trap them in contracts with rising payments, reflecting the long-term costs of predatory lending.</content>

    <title>The Interdependence Between Donors and Investors: Liability of Hybridity, Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Affordances, and Venture Financing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how spatial and digital affordances within entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs) enable early-stage hybrid ventures to overcome the liability of hybridity and to secure funding from both philanthropic and equity funding sources. Using a simultaneous equation model with a U.S.-based sample of 2,723 hybrid ventures, we demonstrate that philanthropic and equity funding exhibit a statistically and economically significant complementary relationship. We further find that accelerator participation weakens this complementary relationship, while social media utilization strengthens it. These findings highlight the mechanisms through which EE-based affordances enhance hybrid ventures’ ability to navigate competing institutional logics and attract diverse funding sources.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Root metaphors shape and reflect thinking in a field of research. This article analyzes how root metaphors from management studies are used in mainstream entrepreneurship research. We show how some root metaphors have been adapted, particularly those with negative connotations. We use the adapted metaphors to identify blind spots, suggest areas of research largely overlooked, and provide alternative perspectives on familiar phenomena in mainstream entrepreneurship research. We identify a positive root metaphor—organizations as instruments of emancipation—and discuss how it contributes to the canon of root metaphors for organizations, hitherto characterized as neutral or negative.</content>

    <title>Art for Whose Sake? Managing Professional Autonomy and Empowered Clients in the Porcelain Capital of China</title>
    <updated>2025-06-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing research suggests that experts often protect their professional autonomy by rejecting lay clients’ feedback or passing it to intermediaries (e.g., managers and agents). However, the rise of review platforms and disintermediated marketplaces has empowered clients to publicly share challenging feedback, and experts’ defensive tactics may further erode public trust in their services. In contrast, our qualitative study of 67 porcelain artists in China reveals that experts can effectively translate clients’ feedback to preserve their professional autonomy. These artistsdecomposedanddistilledtheir expertise—differentiating the essential, identity-defining aspects from the more-peripheral, expendable ones—allowing them to incorporate clients’ feedback into the latter aspects while retaining control over the former ones. This strategy enabled the artists to integrate client-driven creations into their professional identity as artistic experts, thereby preserving their professional autonomy. Notably, not all artists adopted this strategy. Those who considered their work as an indivisible whole were financially compelled to bend to clients’ demands, or they chose to exit the profession. These findings present a paradoxical view of professional autonomy, suggesting that experts can maintain their professional freedom by granting clients limited and selective influence, thereby fostering clients’ compliance and public recognition in an era of increasing influence by lay audiences.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines whether more bank presence in underserved areas can improve house- holds’ health. Leveraging a 2005 Reserve Bank of India policy and a regression discon- tinuity design, I demonstrate that five years post-policy, treatment districts have 27 more bank branches than control districts. This expansion increases household employment and access to savings accounts, enhancing health investments. On the healthcare supply side, hospitals utilize more credit and expand services. Six years after the policy, households in treatment districts are 19 percentage points less likely to suffer from non-chronic illnesses in a given month. Chronic diseases remain unaffected.</content>

    <title>Filling the Gap: The Consequences of Collaborator Loss in Corporate R&amp;amp;D</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how collaborator loss affects the individual productivity of knowledge workers in corporate research and development (R&amp;D). Specifically, we argue that the effect of such loss depends on whether the lost collaborator was internal or external to the organization, which may have compensatory measures in place to maintain the continuity of R&amp;D efforts. To empirically investigate the effect of internal and external collaborator loss, we leverage 845 unexpected deaths of active inventors. We find a substantial negative effect on inventive productivity for the loss of external collaborators, particularly when the collaborator was of presumably high relevance to the remaining inventor. In contrast, the effect for the loss of internal collaborators is virtually zero. We show that the organization’s knowledge management and hiring capabilities are instrumental in explaining the muted effect of internal collaborator loss.This paper was accepted by Toby Stuart, innovation &amp; entrepreneurship.Funding: This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Grant 329144242 and Collaborative Research Center TRR 190] and the Agencia Estatal de Investigacion [Grants CEX2019-000915-S and RYC2022-038012-I].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03045 .</content>

    <title>Institutional Logics as a Resource and Risk: Logic Deviance and Categorical Penalties in US Community Banks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can institutional logics be damaging for the same category of actors they are presumed to benefit? Can firms prevent or reduce this detrimental effect? This study integrates the institutional logics perspective with category research to examine these questions in the context of community banks. Community banks are locally embedded firms explicitly adhering to the community logic – a worldview that emphasizes the values of mutual trust and reciprocity. While previous research suggests that the community logic can benefit the financial performance of locally embedded firms, we propose that it can also impose risks, depending on the circumstances. Specifically, we predict that a stronger community logic not only benefits the financial performance of locally embedded firms, but also increases categorical penalties (i.e., delegitimation and stigma), damaging the financial performance of non‐culpable firms when other community firms commit wrongdoing. We also predict that firms can diminish categorical penalties through community investment. Examining the financial performance of the full sample of US community banks in 352 communities for the years 2006–2013, we find robust empirical support for these predictions.</content>

    <title>The Scale Orientation Effect: How the Spatial and Magnitude Orientation of Scales Shapes Survey Responses</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Technology makes it possible for researchers and practitioners to change the orientation of scales. Scales can be oriented horizontally from left-to-right with values increasing (0 left-10 right) or decreasing (10 left-0 right), or vertically from top-to-bottom with values increasing (0 top-10 bottom) or decreasing (10 top-0 bottom). Does the congruence of a scale’s spatial orientation (whether it is horizontal versus vertical) and magnitude orientation (the direction in which values increase) influence survey responses? Seven preregistered experiments (N=6002) and four preregistered supplemental experiments (N = 5674) examine the effect of a scale’s spatial-magnitude congruence on Net Promoter Scores (NPS). The results show that scales with incongruent spatial-magnitude orientations result in lower NPS ratings than those with congruent ones. We propose that horizontal and vertical spatial orientations are associated with a specific magnitude orientation in the mind. Horizontal scales feel more intuitive with increasing (0 left-10 right) versus decreasing (10 left-0 right) magnitude. Vertical scales feel more intuitive with decreasing (10 top-0 bottom) versus increasing (0 top-10 bottom) magnitudes. Researchers and managers designing surveys to measure consequential constructs such as NPS should not change the spatial-magnitude orientation of their scales across companies, survey platforms, or time—such changes can render their data less comparable.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Marketers make various forecasts, including those about new products, financial instruments, sporting events, and medical procedures, to influence consumer decisions. In communicating the likelihood that a forecaster assigns to an outcome, the forecaster can refer to their confidence in the outcome (e.g., “I’m 30% confident”) or the probability of the outcome (e.g., “There is a 30% probability”). We propose that the choice of language (e.g., probability vs. confidence) affects the perceptions of forecasters, yielding predictable consequences on consumer decisions. Specifically, we argue that some languages (e.g., confident/sure/certain) encourage internal attributions (e.g., to a forecaster), whereas other languages (e.g., probability/likelihood/chance) encourage external attributions (e.g., to an outcome). As a result, expressions of a forecaster’s confidence (vs. outcome probability) make the forecaster look less competent, especially when the likelihood of the outcome is low. A series of studies shows the effect in various consumption scenarios. We further show that the effect is mediated by internal (vs. external) attributions, influences real betting decisions, and is mitigated when the likelihood is high and among consumers with a weaker tendency to make internal attributions (ie, a weaker correspondence bias).</content>

    <title>Silence Inside Systems: Roots and Generativity Consequences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Modern information technology (IT) systems evolve less through visible coordination and more through subtle behavioral patterns—most notably, silence: the relative absence of interaction internally. We conceptualize silence as a dynamic system-wide behavior distinct from architecture. This quietness is a powerful design trait. Our study of nearly 1,400 systems over 25 years shows that when modules “talk” less, developers focus more, accelerating evolutionary innovation. Silent systems produce cleaner, more maintainable code and are 600 times more likely to be extended by others. This matters now more than ever. As systems grow larger and more entangled, brittleness has become a pressing problem; small tweaks routinely trigger large failures. Brute-force solutions, like scaling compute power, are reaching physical and economic limits. Silence is an architectural antidote; by reducing internal dependencies, it lets teams adapt swiftly, avoid technical debt spirals, and better steward artificial intelligence-driven and autonomous systems. For practitioners and policymakers, this paper urges a rethink of how we build and sustain IT systems. Rather than endlessly scaling resources to support chatty, tightly linked modules, designers should prioritize structural quietness. Silence is not just good hygiene; it is a lever for IT resilience, scalability, and generative innovation. Silence is golden; it is what sharpens attention, anchors stability, and unlocks generative possibility.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Startup founders often encounter paradoxical tensions. Yet, whether and how startup accelerators can equip founders to embrace such contradictions remains underexplored. Our study of Y Combinator reveals that accelerators can play a pivotal role in cultivating an entrepreneurial paradox mindset by exposing founders to teachings about paradoxical tensions, imparting heuristics to navigate them, and implementing thoughtful design choices to foster learning—particularly through vicarious and experiential learning opportunities. This study integrates paradox theory into entrepreneurship research, contributes to understanding the interplay between accelerator design choices and entrepreneurial learning, extends knowledge of entrepreneurial mindsets, and provides several practical insights.</content>

    <title>Human Capital Theory and Venture Capital Firms: Exploring “Home Runs” and “Strike Outs”—A Replication and Extension of Dimov and Shepherd (2005)</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The present work is a registered report1focused on a replication and extension of the findings in Dimov and Shepherd (2005). Our work tests the hypotheses from the original article in an expanded industry context and with an updated sample. The wider sample includes low- and medium-tech industries, and an expanded time frame as opposed to the original sample based on the high-tech wireless industry in a 5-year span. We used the same estimation technique (OLS regression) from the original article but also expand on it by using multivariate regression and seemingly unrelated regression to model multiple outcomes simultaneously as well as negative binomial analyses to accommodate the count nature of outcome variables—initial public offerings as home runs and bankruptcies as strike outs. We also model more fine-grained outcomes of venture capital (VC) investments (underpricing, 180-day return, market value). Our findings support the inference that general human capital has a significant effect on investment success measures. Furthermore, the findings align with predictions about the relation between general and specific human capital in reducing measures of investment failure. Our replication and extension efforts are crucial in advancing the literature with regard to four key points. First, we find that the types of human capital vary in their influence on VC-related outcomes. Second, by examining alternative measures of VC-related outcomes, we illustrate that the effect of human capital on VC outcomes varies depending on the measure of outcome. Third, our results suggest that the relation between human capital and VC-related outcomes varies by industry type and time to exit. Fourth, our reexamine of the findings from Dimov and Shepherd (2005) seems to illustrate support for hypotheses that were unsupported in the original study.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While Black entrepreneurs have historically received less startup funding than White entrepreneurs, the nuances of this relationship have been understudied. We employ role and intersectionality theory to fill this gap by examining how race and associated stereotypes of Black entrepreneurs influence the impact of entrepreneurs’ prior fundraising track record on current fundraising efforts. Using 1,164 hand-coded crowdfunding campaigns and a follow-on experiment, we find that Black entrepreneurs receive less credit for prior success, and are penalized more for prior failure, than White entrepreneurs. Gender moderates this relationship in that Black women see even less benefit from prior success and experience a larger decline in support after failure than Black men.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how sales and employment growth shape employee job satisfaction in startups. Grounded in Penrosean growth theory and related literature, we propose an inverted U‐shaped relationship, where excessive growth triggers the “Penrose Effect” and impairs employee job satisfaction. Analysis of multilevelGlassdoor.comdata reveals modest support for this relationship in employment growth, which is stronger for firms undergoing rapid workforce expansion. Exploratory text analysis further suggests that rapid employment growth exposes socio‐structural challenges, and rapid sales growth reveals managerial deficiencies in the scaling of revenues. The differences between these mediating mechanisms suggest that the Penrose effect may be less binding than previously theorized, warranting further scrutiny. Our findings bridge macro‐level growth dynamics with micro‐level employee experiences, providing insights into the contemporary challenges of rapidly growing firms.Managerial SummaryDoes startup growth enhance the employee work experience? If so, is it bound by the rate of growth? Our study offers insights into these questions by combiningGlassdoor.comreviews with startup financial data and reveals that moderate levels of growth can enhance employee job satisfaction, while rapid expansion can undermine it. We identify two key mechanisms: first, rapid employment growth strains workplace dynamics, creating challenges with diversity, inclusion, and team cohesion. Second, rapid sales growth exposes management's limitations in scaling products and services effectively. For startup leaders, these findings shed light on how the tradeoffs of accelerated growth can cascade into employee‐level challenges that impair job satisfaction.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how bank advertising practices contribute to racial disparities in financial markets by steering minorities toward inferior products. We exploit a regulatory change that incentivizes deposit collection at the Freedman’s Savings Bank, the first institution to collect deposits from African Americans post-Emancipation, by facilitating misuse of depositor funds. After deregulation, advertising volume rises, particularly in African American newspapers, leading to increased deposits from Black depositors despite the bank’s insolvency. We identify persuasion as a key mechanism; prescriptive stereotypes and false claims likely amplify advertising’s impact on African Americans, exacerbating historically large depositor losses after the bank’s collapse.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bank capital requirements are based on book values, which are slow to reflect losses. In this article, we develop a dynamic model of banks to study the interaction of regulation and delayed accounting. Our model explains four stylized facts: book and market values diverge during crises, the market-to-book ratio predicts future profitability, book leverage constraints rarely bind strictly even as market leverage fans out during crises, and banks delever gradually after net-worth shocks. We show how delayed accounting can allow the regulator to achieve better outcomes than immediate (mark-to-market) accounting. In an estimated version of the model, the optimal regulation couples faster loan-loss recognition with a modest relaxation of the book leverage constraint.</content>

    <title>A Theory of Cash Flow-Based Financing with Distress Resolution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a dynamic contracting theory of asset- and cash flow-based financing that demonstrates how firm, intermediary, and capital market characteristics jointly shape firms’ financing constraints. A firm with imperfect access to equity financing covers financing needs through costly sources: an intermediary and retained cash. The firm’s financing capacity is endogenously determined by either the liquidation value of assets (asset-based) or the intermediary’s going-concern valuation of the firm’s cash flows (cash flow-based). The optimal contract is implemented with defaultable debt—specifically unsecured credit lines and senior-secured debt—and features risk-sharing via bankruptcy. When the firm does well, it repays its debt in full. When it does poorly, distress resolution mirrors U.S. bankruptcy procedures (Chapters 7 and 11). Secured and unsecured debt are complements because risk-sharing via unsecured debt increases secured debt capacity. Debt and equity are dynamic complements because future access to equity financing increases current debt capacity.</content>

    <title>The impact of tax shields on bankruptcy risk and resource allocation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates how tax loss carryforward (LCF) rules influence corporate bankruptcies and market-wide productivity. Analyzing data from 29 European countries, I find that stricter LCF deductibility limits significantly increase bankruptcy likelihoods. This is because stricter LCF deductibility limits lower the present value of net operating losses (NOLs) as tax assets, reducing the incentive to keep struggling firms alive. This effect is especially pronounced for business group firms, which can support struggling affiliates through internal capital markets to strategically exploit NOLs. My results suggest that lenient LCF deductibility limits can sustain unproductive firms, impacting market-wide resource allocation and productivity. These findings highlight the trade-off in tax policy between supporting firm survival and ensuring efficient resource allocation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Gender imbalance in time spent on child rearing causes gender inequalities in labor market outcomes, human capital accumulation, and economic mobility. We conduct a large-scale field experiment with a near-universe of US schools to investigate a potential source of inequality: external demands for parental involvement. Schools receive an email from a fictitious two-parent household and are asked to call one of the parents back. Mothers are 1.4 times more likely than fathers to be contacted. We decompose this inequality and demonstrate that the gender gap in external demands is associated with various measures of gender norms. We also show that signaling a father’s availability substantially changes the gender pattern of callbacks. Our findings underscore a process through which agents outside the household contribute to within-household gender inequalities.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a framework to measure the welfare impact of macroeconomic shocks throughout the distribution. The first-order impact of a shock is summarized by the induced movements in agents’ feasible sets: their budget constraint and borrowing constraints. We combine estimated impulse response functions with micro-data on household consumption bundles, asset holdings, and labor income for different US households. We find that inflationary oil shocks are regressive, but monetary expansions are progressive, and there is substantial heterogeneity throughout the life cycle. In all cases, the dominant channel is the effect of the shock on the cost of accumulating assets, not movements in goods prices or labor income.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When a platform has limited inventory, it is important to have a variety of products available for each customer while managing the remaining stock. To maximize revenue over the long term, the assortment policy needs to take into account the complex purchasing behavior of customers whose arrival orders and preferences may be unknown. We propose a data-driven approach for dynamic assortment planning that utilizes historical customer arrivals and transaction data. To address the challenge of online assortment customization, we use a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework and employ a model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to solve the online assortment policy because of the computational challenge. Our method uses a specially designed deep neural network (DNN) model to create assortments while observing the inventory constraints, and an Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to update the parameters of the DNN model, with the help of a simulator built from the historical transaction data. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct simulations using both a synthetic data set generated with a pre-determined customer type distribution and ground-truth choice model, as well as a real-world data set. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach produces significantly higher long-term revenue compared to some existing methods and remains robust under various practical conditions.We also demonstrate that our approach can be easily adapted to a more general problem that includes reusable products, where customers might return purchased items. In this setting, we find that our approach performs well under various usage time distributions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Humans and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms increasingly interact on unstructured managerial tasks. We propose that tailoring this human-AI interaction to align with individuals’ cognitive preferences is essential for enhancing performance. This hypothesis is examined through a field experiment in a multinational pharmaceutical firm. In the experiment, we manipulated four contextual parameters of human-AI interaction—work procedures, decision-making authority, training, and incentives—to align with sales experts’ cognitive styles, categorized as either adaptors or innovators. Our results show that tailored interaction significantly improves sales performance, whereas untailored interaction results in negative treatment effects compared with both the tailored and control conditions. Qualitative evidence suggests that this negative outcome arises from role conflicts and ambiguities in untailored interaction. Exploring the mechanisms underlying these outcomes further, a mediation analysis of AI login data reveals that human-AI interaction tailoring leads sales experts to adjust their AI utilization, which contributes to the observed performance outcomes. These findings support a human-centered approach to AI that prioritizes individuals’ information-processing needs and tailors their interaction with AI accordingly.This paper has been This paper was accepted by Catherine Tucker for the Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: This work was supported by Erling Persson Family Foundation; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung [Grants 100013M 204670, 181364, 185164]; Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse samt Tore Browaldhs Stiftelse [Grant W20-0036]; Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation [Grants 2021.0074, 2021.0133].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03849 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on productivity in the context of taxi drivers. The AI we study assists drivers with finding customers by suggesting routes along which the demand is predicted to be high. We find that AI improves drivers’ productivity by shortening the cruising time, and this gain is accrued only to low-skilled drivers, narrowing the productivity gap between high- and low-skilled drivers by 13.4%. This case study provides evidence that AI and skill are indeed substitutes, offering direct support for the underlying assumption of recent projection exercises regarding job displacement by AI.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI [Grants 23K25495, 23H00828, 22H00847, 22H05009, and 22H00057], JST RISTEX [Grant JPMJRX18H3], and JST ERATO [Grant JPMJER2301].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01631 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Advances in behavioral targeting allow media firms to better monetize based on advertising. However, behavioral ad targeting requires consumer tracking, which has heightened privacy concerns among consumers and regulators. We examine how stricter privacy regulations that ban consumer tracking affect media firms’ content strategies and ideological positioning. We consider a model where media firms choose their ideological positioning and advertising, whereas ideologically heterogeneous consumers select their preferred content based on both their ideology and idiosyncratic taste shocks. We compare two salient informational environments: (1) behavioral ad targeting, where perfect inference about consumers is allowed, and (2) contextual ad targeting, where consumer tracking is banned due to privacy regulations, and media firms can only infer consumer types based on their media choice. We show that privacy regulations that ban behavioral ad targeting incentivize media firms to shift toward more extreme and polarizing positioning in order to draw better inferences about consumer types, even though the shift to more extreme ideological positions can hurt both demand and consumer welfare from content consumption. Compared with the monopoly case, competition increases firms’ inference motives and leads to more polarized content over a wider range of parameters due to an inferential complementarity effect arising from consumer self-selection. Our research uncovers a previously unexplored relationship between privacy and polarization, shedding light on the potential unintended consequences of privacy regulations in media markets.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the NET Institute.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06054 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digital signage at the point of sale is emerging as a significant revenue source for retailers and a growing advertising platform for manufacturing brands. Yet, empirical research on its effectiveness remains limited. This study leverages a novel technology and field experimental data spanning 237 advertising campaigns and 30 million shoppers to fill this gap. We find that digital signage increases the likelihood of purchasing featured products by 8.1%. This effect is amplified for hedonic, novel, and low-priced products, as well as for popular brands. It is also stronger on weekends, later in the day, during favorable weather, in crowded stores, for emotional advertising messages, and in the absence of concurrent promotional cues. The impact of digital signage further increases when it is placed in close proximity to the advertised product. Unlike price promotions, digital signage does not affect spending for those who purchase the products. Notably, exposure to digital signage also boosts sales of other products from the same brand and within the same category, without causing purchase acceleration—indicating that it drives incremental consumption. These findings offer new insights into the efficacy of in-store advertising with digital signage and provide actionable guidance for optimizing its use.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The proliferation of broadband internet has sparked concerns about the future of brick-and-mortar retail. I explore consumer behavior in the US consumer packaged goods (CPG) sector during broadband’s proliferation from 2004 to 2019. Using household panel and retail scanner data covering more than 40,000 brands in 900 categories, I analyze nine household and retailer outcomes: brands purchased, trips taken, retailers visited, offline spending, any online spending, online spending share, prices, price dispersion, and demand elasticities. I combine US Census and FCC data to track the rollout of broadband. In contrast to established notions that broadband adoption would rapidly transform shopping behaviors in this period, my findings reveal a more nuanced and gradual pattern of change. Exploiting geographic variation in broadband growth, I find economically modest average effects with significant heterogeneity by age and household income. The analysis reveals generational differences, sharp declines in brick-and-mortar shopping among younger consumers counterbalanced by relative stability in larger older cohorts. In short, this paper finds that broadband access drove a gradual evolution in consumer behavior, rather than a dramatic upheaval.</content>

    <title>Indigenizing Brokerage: How Western Brokers Bridge Environment and Nature Worldviews in Global Market Relations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Brokering between actors such as Indigenous producers and Western multinationals participating in global market relations typically requires bridging different worldviews, each with different implications for economic activity: a ‘nature’ worldview where production is often limited to preserve ecological balance, and an ‘environment’ worldview where nature is a resource to be exploited. Given these differences and the traditional hegemony of Western actors, the question of whether and how brokers can facilitate market relations that are beneficial for Indigenous and Western actors alike becomes pressing. Building on recent decolonial literature that has highlighted the possibility of rendering traditionally Western‐dominated market relations ‘more Indigenous’ or ‘less colonial’ and cultural brokerage scholarship, we conducted a case study of a Western consulting firm brokering between an MNC and Indigenous communities in Costa Rica. Based on an effective brokering process after a perceived crisis point, we theorize the model of ‘Indigenizing brokerage’ to explain how brokering between the two worldviews can lead to mutual benefits through three interrelated processes. Contributing to the literature on cultural brokerage and decolonial scholarship, the model introduces a much‐needed framework to better understand what ‘more Indigenous’ could mean in global market relations and adds insights into supply chain brokerage.</content>

    <title>Kinesthetic Properties of Response Scales Yield Different Judgments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research examines how the movements an interface requires of a consumer—that is, its “kinesthetic properties”—can alter what a consumer attends to when responding and, in turn, change the response itself. We compare the kinesthetic properties of two ubiquitous scale formats, slider and radio-button scales. Six studies (plus four in the Web Appendix) show dragging a slider (vs. clicking a radio button) elicits responses that are closer to the scale starting point. This effect occurs because the slider allows participants to engage with the scale as they consider their options. When dragging past each response option, attention is directed to that option, increasing its chance of being selected. Supporting this account, sliders only result in responses closer to the starting point when participants physically drag the cursor across options to their desired response, not when they directly click on it. Furthermore, participants dragging a slider interact with the scale earlier in the judgment process and exhibit a greater visual focus on left-side (vs. right-side) options on the scale compared to participants clicking a radio button. These findings suggest marketers, graphic designers, and researchers should consider how the kinesthetic properties of digital interfaces may shape consumer judgment.</content>

    <title>Departmental Boundaries and Knowledge Sharing in Corporate Online Communities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractCan organizational boundaries still hinder knowledge-sharing in an online setting such as corporate online communities? Whereas the existing studies usually respond “yes” to the question, our study argues that this is not necessarily the case. We propose and empirically test two key motivations driving knowledge-sharing inclinations subjected to organizational boundaries, namely, knowledge-focused motivations and social-related motivations. Our analyses focus on departmental boundaries using data from a large corporate Q&amp;A platform. We show a robust pattern: employees are more inclined to share knowledge within their departments (i.e., intradepartmental knowledge-sharing inclination). Notably, intradepartmental knowledge-sharing inclination is uniquely driven more by knowledge-focused motivations (versus social-related motivations). Managers should consider the revealed intradepartmental knowledge-sharing inclination when designing policies to promote knowledge sharing across departmental boundaries, and the focus should be on social-related motivations. Also, it is worth noting that intradepartmental knowledge-sharing inclination is also driven by knowledge-focused reasons, reflected by knowledge providers’ desire to share helpful knowledge, and the knowledge-focused mechanisms are not necessarily detrimental to knowledge sharing. Finally, it is reassuring that we do not find negative associations between intradepartmental knowledge sharing and individual material outcomes such as work performance and promotions.</content>
