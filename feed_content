      <title>Stairway to impact or highway to failure? A cognitive perspective on business model design processes in nascent sustainable ventures</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/sej.1531</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;Abstract&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:sec&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;Research Summary&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt;Sustainable new ventures seeking to tackle grand challenges such as climate change or biodiversity loss through new business models face the difficult task of reconciling social and ecological goals with profit. To provide a better understanding of how founders balance such tensions and develop viable business models, this longitudinal case study traces the evolution of business models in six nascent sustainable ventures. We find that depending on the founding team's cognitive configuration (i.e., narrow vs. paradoxical), sustainable new ventures develop business models along two alternative paths. Reflecting different approaches to business model design in terms of what is done, how it is done, and when it is done, these trajectories explain why some ventures survive beyond the proof‐of‐concept phase while others do not.&lt;/jats:p&gt;&lt;/jats:sec&gt;&lt;jats:sec&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;Managerial Summary&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt;Our study of six sustainable new ventures provides several insights for entrepreneurs on creating viable business models that meet social, ecological, and commercial goals. Founders should pursue a patient, experimental approach to business model design, avoiding early commitments while seeking stakeholder feedback for deeper insights into the challenges at hand. Furthermore, the team's mindset (narrow or paradoxical), influenced by members' value concepts (idealistic or pragmatic), determines the venture's design path. Teams with a paradoxical mindset, simultaneously integrating social, ecological, and economic goals, are more likely to navigate beyond the proof‐of‐concept phase successfully. Moreover, having idealistic and pragmatic perspectives within the team fosters cognitive diversity, which is crucial to dealing with complex challenges effectively.&lt;/jats:p&gt;&lt;/jats:sec&gt;</description>

      <title>Intraday Market Return Predictability Culled from the Factor Zoo</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01657</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; We provide strong empirical evidence for time-series predictability of the intraday return on the aggregate market portfolio by exploiting lagged high-frequency cross-sectional returns on the factor zoo. Our results rely on the use of modern machine-learning techniques to regularize the predictive regressions and help tame the signals stemming from the zoo together with techniques from financial econometrics to differentiate between continuous and theoretically nonpredictable discontinuous high-frequency price increments. Using the predictions from the model estimated for the aggregate market portfolio in the formulation of simple intraday trading strategies for a set of highly liquid ETFs results in sizeable out-of-sample Sharpe ratios and alphas after accounting for transaction costs. Further dissecting the abnormal intraday returns, we find that most of the superior performance may be traced to periods of high economic uncertainty and a few key factors related to tail risk and liquidity, pointing to slow-moving capital and the gradual incorporation of new information as the underlying mechanisms at work. &lt;/jats:p&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance. &lt;/jats:p&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01657 . &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>From Hopeful Heroes to Cynical Martyrs: Identity Work and the Path‐Dependent Identification with Maladaptive Logics</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/joms.13173</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;Abstract&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt;Scholars have long attended to both the persistence and change of institutional logic–identity constellations, but we know less about why and how organizational members might cling to a logic despite its evident maladaptive character and the resulting emotional upheaval. Based on a 5‐year ethnography of a conservation organization's paramilitary campaign against rhino poaching, we induct a process model to show how the crisis‐induced adoption of a new logic and the corresponding identity work can have path‐dependent effects that tip hopeful heroism into cynical martyrdom and a dogged commitment to a maladaptive logic, with negative organizational implications. We identify three forms of identity work that act as self‐reinforcing mechanisms of this path dependence: &lt;jats:italic&gt;polarizing&lt;/jats:italic&gt;, &lt;jats:italic&gt;normalizing&lt;/jats:italic&gt;, and &lt;jats:italic&gt;cynical coping&lt;/jats:italic&gt;. Elaborating the intersection of scholarship on institutions, identity work, identification, and path dependence, we explain how an initially valorized identity can twist into a darker, dysfunctional version of itself, with path‐dependent mechanisms contributing to organizational rigidity in the face of crises.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Desperate Journeys to Europe: Sensebreaking in Extreme Contexts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/joms.13174</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;Abstract&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt;This paper uncovers the ways in which sensebreaking processes are initiated and then unfold over time in extreme contexts. Using semi‐structured interviews with irregular migrants from Pakistan undertaking perilous journeys to Europe, this research makes two major contributions to the literatures on extreme contexts and sensebreaking. First, we develop two temporal modes of sensebreaking: sensebreaking with the past and sensebreaking with the future. We reveal the role of liminal spaces in sensebreaking and explain why sensebreaking needs to be reconceptualized as an inherently protracted, often indeterminate, process. Second, we uncover the triggers and drivers of sensebreaking in extreme contexts. We identify two states that precipitate sensebreaking, derealization and disorientation. We theorize the ways in which they are triggered by emotional and physical disruptions and their role in sustaining sensebreaking over time. We also explicate how temporal irregularities, particularly time contortion and time appropriation, influence the development of sensebreaking in extreme contexts.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>In the Company of Strangers: Social Influence from Anonymous Peers in Online Game Settings</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucae075</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;Abstract&lt;/jats:title&gt;
               &lt;jats:p&gt;Social interactions among consumers, especially in the consumption of digital goods, have become commonplace in an increasingly interconnected marketplace. As such, understanding the impact of such interactions on consumer behavior carries major academic and practitioner significance. This research focuses on an important, but under-researched aspect of social influence and the underlying mechanisms that may be driving peer effects. Using the context of a massive online peer-to-peer game, we estimate peer effects arising from anonymous peers. The findings suggest a robust and significant influence of anonymous peers on one’s own purchase behavior. Further, we find that peer effects arising from anonymous peers are largely driven by informational reasons as opposed to competitive concern even in a competitive online gaming context. That is, players rely on others’ purchase decisions despite anonymity; moreover, such influence is more pronounced for inexperienced players with little contextual knowledge. To demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging the nature of peer influence in online game settings, we provide an illustrative example using an intervention simulation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for marketing academia and practitioners in the video game industry.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Technology differentiation, product market rivalry, and M&amp;amp;A transactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.3687</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;Abstract&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:sec&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;Research Summary&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt;We study how unique firm technology influences M&amp;amp;A activity. Using a text‐based network approach, we map each firm's position relative to every other firm in technology space to measure the uniqueness of its technology portfolio. Our findings indicate that firms with more unique technology portfolios become prime acquisition targets, particularly for close competitors within the same product market segments. These competitors seek to reduce competition and incorporate unique technologies to strengthen their competitive advantage. Furthermore, firms with unique technology portfolios tend to attract acquirers with closer technological proximity, facilitating the evaluation and integration of these technology assets. Our study underscores unique technology as a critical asset in the market for corporate control and a key driver of M&amp;amp;A transactions.&lt;/jats:p&gt;&lt;/jats:sec&gt;&lt;jats:sec&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;Managerial Summary&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt;In today's high‐tech business environment, M&amp;amp;As are pivotal strategies not just for growth and competitiveness but often specifically aimed at acquiring the technology of target firms. By analyzing US public firms, we demonstrate that those with unique technology portfolios attract more acquisition interest, particularly from close product market rivals. These rivals aim to reduce competition and strengthen their existing product business by incorporating the unique technology. Companies with unique technology are also particularly appealing to those within closer technological proximity, easing the evaluation and integration process. Our findings emphasize that possessing a unique technology portfolio is a vital asset in the market for corporate control and a major catalyst for mergers and acquisitions activities.&lt;/jats:p&gt;&lt;/jats:sec&gt;</description>

      <title>Optimizing Service Operations With Price- and Density-Dependent Demand: A Copula-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1177/10591478241302764</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; Exclusivity is a key component of certain service offerings such as elite members-only social or country clubs. Indeed, such services may only appeal to customers if they limit the crowd density, that is, the maximal number of customers granted access to the service. We consider a service provider, who sets its crowd density cap in addition to its price. Customers are heterogeneous in both their willingness to pay (WTP) for the service and their density tolerance. Each customer purchases the service only if the price is below her WTP and the density is below her tolerance. Importantly, customers’ WTP and density tolerance may be statistically dependent, and we develop a novel, copula-based framework to model the dependence structure of these two dimensions of heterogeneity. We analytically characterize the provider’s optimal price and density decisions. As long as the customer population is not too severely sensitive to density: (i) the provider optimally serves all segments of the market and sets the price and density so that the price, not the density, is the determining factor for customers (from a particular subpopulation) on the margin between purchasing and not and (ii) as customers’ valuations and density tolerances become more positively dependent, the provider earns higher revenue and optimally increases its service density. By contrast, the optimal price is quasi-convex but not necessarily increasing. On the other hand, with severely density-sensitive customers, it may be optimal to partially cover the market and to make density the determining factor in customer decisions. Our findings offer prescriptive guidelines for service operations in the presence of density-sensitive demand and also provide an explanation for the failed versus successful practices of prominent private clubs. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Doubly Optimal No-Regret Online Learning in Strongly Monotone Games with Bandit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2021.0445</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; Doubly Optimal No-Regret Online Learning in Strongly Monotone Games with Bandit Feedback &lt;/jats:p&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; Curious about how players can learn and adapt in unknown games without knowing the game’s dynamics? In “Doubly Optimal No-Regret Online Learning in Strongly Monotone Games with Bandit Feedback,” Ba, Lin, Zhang, and Zhou present a novel bandit learning algorithm for no-regret learning in games where each player only observes its reward determined by all players’ current joint action, not its gradient. Focusing on smooth and strongly monotone games, they introduce a bandit learning algorithm using self-concordant barrier functions. This algorithm achieves optimal single-agent regret and optimal last-iterate convergence rate in multiagent learning to the Nash equilibrium. Their work significantly improves previous methods and demonstrates the algorithm’s effectiveness through numerical results in various applications. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trademarks and Entrepreneurial Firm Success: Theory and Evidence from Venture Capital Investments in Private Firms</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1177/10422587241300438</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; We theoretically model an entrepreneur’s choice of his firm’s products to trademark, the relation between the number of trademarks and venture capital (VC) investment staging, long-run operating performance, and successful firm exit probability. We test model predictions using a large dataset of trademarks registered by VC-backed private US firms. We find that firms with a larger number of trademarks at first VC investment have a smaller number of VC financing rounds; have larger long-run sales and employment; and have greater probabilities of successful exit (initial public offering [IPO] or acquisition). Our instrumental variable analysis demonstrates that more trademarks causally enhance firm performance and reduce VC staging. &lt;/jats:p&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; JEL code: G23, G24, L26, O34 &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>To Be or Not to Be Green? The Double‐Edged Sword of Pro‐Environmental Pressure in the Workplace</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/hrm.22273</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt;Contemporary organizations are paying greater attention to improving environmental sustainability. Recognizing the value of employee engagement in enhancing sustainability, organizations emphasize the involvement of employees in environmental protection. Academic literature and anecdotal evidence have suggested that employees may come to work with pressure to engage in pro‐environmental behavior (PEB). However, researchers have overlooked how employees experience pro‐environmental pressure, leaving fundamental questions unanswered in theory building. In this paper, we introduce the concept of pro‐environmental pressure and examine the broader functioning of pro‐environmental pressure at the individual level. Drawing on the transactional theory of stress, we elucidate how this pressure could be experienced as a double‐edged sword that induces both positive and negative responses from employees. We first develop a scale of pro‐environmental pressure and assess its psychometric properties. We then conduct a field study to test the theoretical model, arguing that individuals with different stress mindsets have divergent responses. Employees with a stress‐is‐enhancing mindset are likely to appraise pro‐environmental pressure as a challenge, whereas employees with a stress‐is‐debilitating mindset are likely to appraise it as a threat. Our findings reveal that pro‐environmental pressure could have both functional and dysfunctional implications depending on employee appraisals. When pro‐environmental pressure is appraised as a challenge, employees use a problem‐focused coping strategy and respond with positive behavioral reactions, including engagement in PEB and constructive green voice. However, when pro‐environmental pressure is appraised as a threat, employees use an emotion‐focused coping strategy and respond with negative behavioral reactions, including disengagement from PEB and destructive green voice. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Buffering Role of Anti‐Violence Human Resource Management Practices in Shaping How Police Officers Cope With Workplace Violence</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/hrm.22281</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt;Anti‐violence Human Resource Management (HRM) practices can be used as an organizational resource to buffer the effects of violence experienced by frontline workers. This research examines the process through which different forms of workplace violence (i.e., physical, verbal, and vicarious) impact how employees cope, and thereby their intentions to leave the profession. Drawing on Conservation of Resources (COR) theory, we collected two waves of data (&lt;jats:italic&gt;N&lt;/jats:italic&gt; = 371) from police officers in Victoria, Australia, to test our proposed hypotheses. The findings demonstrated that physical violence, verbal abuse, and vicarious violence were positively associated with coping through denial. Importantly, coping through denial mediated the relationship between physical violence, verbal abuse, and vicarious violence on police officers' intention to leave the profession. Finally, anti‐violence HRM practices buffered the indirect effect of physical violence and vicarious violence on the intention to leave the profession via coping through denial, whereas no effect was found for verbal abuse. Our results therefore suggest that anti‐violence HRM practices play a pivotal role in managing incidents of violence at work against frontline workers. The findings' contributions to HRM theory and practice, as well as future research, are discussed.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Team Diversity as a Safety Asset: A Field Investigation of Language Diversity and Occupational Safety</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/hrm.22280</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt;Despite significant progress in understanding how situational factors influence safety compliance, the effects of team diversity—particularly language diversity—on safety outcomes remain underexplored. This is particularly concerning given the prevalence of language diversity in teams operating in hazardous environments and the disparities in accident rates, injuries, and fatalities among workers from diverse linguistic and racial‐ethnic backgrounds. In this study, we examine how language diversity affects occupational safety, and therefore begin to resolve an unsettled deliberation of whether diversity is a detractor or catalyst of safety outcomes. Integrating social identity theory and work on leader member exchange differentiation, we develop and test a model hypothesizing that team language diversity is positively related to safety compliance and that this relationship can be explained by leaders' relationships with followers. Analysis of survey data from over 1,000 construction workers (162 teams) showed that our hypotheses were generally supported; that team language diversity was positively related to safety compliance. Further, we found that this relationship can be explained by the process of leader‐member exchange differentiation, but only when leaders also exhibit safety‐specific transformational leadership (SSTL). We discuss these results in detail and implications for scientists and human resource practitioners are presented.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Leader–Subordinate Human Resource Attribution (Dis)agreement and Its Impact on Employee Well‐Being: A Frame‐of‐Reference Perspective</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/hrm.22278</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt;Existing human resource (HR) theory highlights that differences in perceptions of HR practices between leaders and subordinates have a critical impact on employee outcomes. We extend such literature by drawing on frame‐of‐reference theory to develop and test a model examining how different patterns of (dis)agreement in leader and subordinate employee HR attributions affect employee well‐being. Specifically, we conceptualize that leaders and subordinates form (dis)similar frames of reference based upon employee well‐being HR attribution, which impacts employee well‐being through organization‐based self‐esteem (OBSE) in different ways. Using polynomial regression and response surface modeling, our results confirm our hypotheses to show that leader–subordinate agreement on employee well‐being HR attribution positively impacts OBSE, with a stronger effect when such attribution agreement is high rather than low. Furthermore, when subordinates have a higher level of employee well‐being HR attribution compared with the leader, there is a more pronounced positive impact on OBSE, which, in turn, enhances employee well‐being. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our study to the HR literature.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>How Does the Visibility of &lt;scp&gt;LGBTQ&lt;/scp&gt;+ Directors Influence Firm Value? The Mediating Role of Environmental, Social, and Governance Performance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/hrm.22283</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt;Board directors who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other identities (LGBTQ+) are now more visible at the corporate apex, as the attainment of diversity, equity, and inclusion at the upper echelons is a goal for many organizations, researchers, and policymakers worldwide. The visibility of LGBTQ+ directors implies the shift toward truly diverse boards that demonstrate commitment to the provision of equal career opportunities and empowerment for all types of individuals. However, we still lack knowledge regarding the relationship between LGBTQ+ board representation and firm outcomes. Drawing on upper echelons and signaling theories, we examine a sample of Fortune 500 companies to identify how LGBTQ+ directors influence their firm values. Our OLS regressions on an unbalanced panel dataset of 441 firms in 2021–2022 reveal that the visibility of LGBTQ+ directors is positively associated with enterprise value, and this relationship is mediated by environmental, social, and governance performance, which can be attributed to corporate social performance. Our research contributes to the literature by showing how the visibility of LGBTQ+ status in the boardroom can matter on firms.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Technical Note: Data-Driven Sample Average Approximation with Covariate Information</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2020.0533</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; Using Side Information to Improve Decision Making Under Uncertainty &lt;/jats:p&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; In many real-world planning settings, side information (also called covariate information, contextual information, or features) can be used to improve the estimates of uncertain parameters. Over the past decade, there has been growing interest in data-driven approaches to stochastic programming that take advantage of such side information. In “Data-Driven Sample Average Approximation with Covariate Information,” Kannan, Bayraksan, and Luedtke investigate two flexible data-driven frameworks that integrate a machine learning prediction model within a sample average approximation (SAA) of a stochastic programming problem, including a novel framework that leverages leave-one-out residuals for scenario generation. They establish conditions on the data generation process, the prediction model, and the stochastic program under which the solutions of these data-driven contextual SAAs exhibit asymptotic and finite sample convergence guarantees. Furthermore, they provide examples illustrating that these data-driven formulations can outperform existing methods in the limited data regime, even if the prediction model is misspecified. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Multitask Learning and Bandits via Robust Statistics</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00490</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; Decision makers often simultaneously face many related but heterogeneous learning problems. For instance, a large retailer may wish to learn product demand at different stores to solve pricing or inventory problems, making it desirable to learn jointly for stores serving similar customers; alternatively, a hospital network may wish to learn patient risk at different providers to allocate personalized interventions, making it desirable to learn jointly for hospitals serving similar patient populations. Motivated by real data sets, we study a natural setting where the unknown parameter in each learning instance can be decomposed into a shared global parameter plus a sparse instance-specific term. We propose a novel two-stage multitask learning estimator that exploits this structure in a sample-efficient way, using a unique combination of robust statistics (to learn across similar instances) and LASSO regression (to debias the results). Our estimator yields improved sample complexity bounds in the feature dimension d relative to commonly employed estimators; this improvement is exponential for “data-poor” instances, which benefit the most from multitask learning. We illustrate the utility of these results for online learning by embedding our multitask estimator within simultaneous contextual bandit algorithms. We specify a dynamic calibration of our estimator to appropriately balance the bias-variance trade-off over time, improving the resulting regret bounds in the context dimension d. Finally, we illustrate the value of our approach on synthetic and real data sets. &lt;/jats:p&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; This paper was accepted by J. George Shanthikumar, data science. &lt;/jats:p&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00490 . &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Autistic Applicants’ Job Interview Experiences and Accommodation Preferences: An Intersectional Analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1177/01492063241308214</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; Although more organizations are seeking autistic applicants, autistic people remain in an unemployment crisis. This may be due in part to job interviews, which often implicitly evaluate relational and social skills—an area with which many autistic people struggle. To determine how to better support autistic applicants, we conduct a mixed methods study to identify, from their own perspective, the accommodations that would have the greatest impact on autistic individuals’ interview anxiety and performance. Additionally, we examine differences in interview anxiety and preferred adjustments to the interview process between both autistic and allistic participants and intersectionally across gender. Findings revealed additive effects of neurotype and gender on interview anxiety, with autistic participants reporting higher anxiety than allistic participants, and women reporting higher anxiety than men. Interestingly, despite a small number of notable differences, there were far more similarities between groups regarding preferred interview adjustments. These findings suggest that many adjustments to the interview process may be helpful across neurotypes, although they are perhaps particularly beneficial for alleviating the comparatively higher anxiety levels experienced by autistic applicants. Overall, there is a need to consider how and whether current interview best practices (e.g., standardization and structure) can be adapted to facilitate the inclusion of diverse neurotypes across a range of individual differences. As a starting point, we offer practical guidelines for managers wishing to improve the interview process for autistic and allistic applicants alike and set a foundation for future research. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Effect of U.S. Country‐by‐Country Reporting on U.S. Multinationals’ Tax‐Motivated Income Shifting and Real Activities</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-679x.12594</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt;The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development introduced country‐by‐country reporting (CbCR) for multinational enterprises (MNEs) to help tax authorities combat tax‐motivated income shifting. This study uses confidential U.S. tax administrative data from 2011 to 2018 to examine the effect of U.S. CbCR adoption on the tax‐motivated income shifting and real activities of U.S. MNEs. We first document that while U.S. CbCR provides the Internal Revenue Service with incremental information about the location of U.S. MNEs’ global activities relative to existing U.S. tax return disclosures, substantial overlap exists between U.S. CbCR and existing disclosures. In contrast with prior CbCR studies in cross‐country settings, we fail to find evidence of a change in U.S. MNEs’ tax‐motivated income shifting or a reallocation of real activities based on tax incentives in response to U.S. CbCR using multiple empirical approaches. Overall, our study leverages U.S. tax administrative data to provide insights into the impact of the CbCR initiative on U.S. MNEs.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Happens to Partners Who Issue Adverse Internal Control Opinions?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-679x.12597</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt;We investigate how audit firms balance the tension between professional responsibility and client service by examining changes in partner assignments following adverse internal control opinions (ICOs). We find that partners are significantly more likely to be reassigned when they issued an adverse ICO to any of their clients in the previous year. Further, partners issuing adverse ICOs experience unfavorable changes in their client portfolios in the form of lower fees and less prestigious assignments. We find that consequences are more negative when adverse ICOs are issued to clients that are more important to the local office and that there are no consequences when partners issue continuing adverse opinions to clients they have “inherited” from an original adverse ICO partner. We also find that the consequences are stronger for partners of non‐Big 4 audit firms that are likely to be more sensitive to client service considerations. The negative portfolio effects we observe persist for at least three years, and our findings are robust to restrictions involving mandatory partner rotation and adverse ICOs that lead to client loss. Overall, our results are consistent with adverse ICO partners experiencing negative consequences as audit firms respond to client service incentives in the area of internal controls over financial reporting.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Short Squeezes After Short‐Selling Attacks</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-679x.12595</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt;We estimate the prevalence and drivers of short squeezes after short‐selling attacks. Positive returns after attacks have a disproportionate tendency to fully reverse and are accompanied by heightened short covering, consistent with the presence of short squeezes. We assess and find no support for non‐squeeze drivers of these positive return reversals and show they are more likely to be accompanied by squeeze‐related news articles, increased stock volatility, and disruptions in the stock lending market. Using positive return reversals as a proxy for short squeezes, we estimate that 15% of short attacks experience squeezes, and squeeze risk increases with short sellers’ visibility but decreases with the credibility of their evidence. Additionally, squeezes appear to be precipitated by actions of firms and investors, including insider purchases, share recalls, retail investor trading, and firm disclosures. Our findings quantify a material risk and check on activist short selling and are especially timely given recent proposed short‐selling restrictions.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Groupthink in the Board of Family Firms: The Case of Institutional Investment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1177/10422587241302702</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; This study explores groupthink on the boards of family firms. We conjecture that institutional investors, in the face of principal–principal agency issues, are discouraged by groupthink and consequently invest less in family firms. Appropriate corporate governance in the form of greater board diversity, lower director tenure, busier boards, more financial disclosure, and bigger shareholder voice should help in alleviating these institutional investor concerns. We examine a sample of firms from the S&amp;amp;P 500 and find evidence consistent with these propositions. Also, we provide evidence that board generational heterogeneity in family firms exacerbates groupthink. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Redesign of Virtual Power Plant-led Electricity Demand Response Program</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1177/10591478241305859</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; As the scale of renewable energy on the demand side continues to grow, a new demand response program (DRP), the virtual power plant (VPP), pays a rebate to the consumer and purchases his rooftop solar electricity. This electricity is dispatched to areas of electricity shortages, which is vital in balancing electricity loads and avoiding energy waste. However, the new DRP differs from the traditional DRP in terms of paying rebates. The traditional DRP requires consumers to respond above a specified baseline to receive a rebate. In contrast, in the new DRP, consumers can receive a rebate even if their response is small (i.e., no baseline). There is no research that addresses this divergence. Therefore, we construct a supply chain consisting of a consumer and a VPP for this novel DRP and analyze the strategic interactions between them in two situations where a baseline is not set/set. Our results show room for improvement in the DRP that dispatches electricity generated from rooftop solar. If the consumer generates more electricity from rooftop solar, the baseline, rather than frustrating the consumer, motivates the consumer to be more responsive. While the baseline also discourages the demand response process, it reduces the emissions generated from the consumer’s over-responsiveness. Additionally, our study suggests that a baseline, whether it facilitates or hinders the DRP, could benefit the VPP, depending on the business model of the VPP. In addition, we add several extensions to demonstrate the robustness of our model. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>On the Disclosure of Defensive Posture: Adversarial Belief Formation and Target Selection Decisions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1177/10591478241309530</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; Due to the strategic and adaptive nature of adversaries, the deployment of new technologies is common practice in the arenas of security and defense (e.g., new baggage scanners at airports). History has shown that the deployment of these technologies has often been disclosed to the public, allowing malicious actors to potentially understand which venues are defended, and how. There is limited research examining how information disclosed about the deployment of new security measures can impact the beliefs and decisions of adversaries. Studying these beliefs and decisions is critical in obtaining insights into adversarial behavior, which can inform the allocation of defensive resources and the design of related information disclosures. This article aims to address this gap by studying how people—who are motivated to attack one among multiple targets—respond when receiving information from a defender regarding the deployment of new security measures at those targets. We address whether attackers (i) believe the information they receive from the defender and (ii) choose to attack after learning that new security measures may be deployed at their target(s) of interest. We find that attackers’ beliefs regarding where new security measures are deployed, and their decisions to attack particular targets, are impacted by the information they receive from the defender and by their understanding of the defender’s target valuations, highlighting the importance of strategic information disclosure in counterterrorism operations. In an experimental setting with two targets, when attackers ([Formula: see text]) knew that the defender valued one target much more than the other, they had a stronger belief that security measures would be deployed at the higher-value target, even when the defender announced that only the lower-valued target was protected with enhanced security. We also identify important factors that increase the likelihood of deterrence (i.e., when adversaries decide not to attack), which is a major goal in counterterrorism operations. Overall, this study provides novel insights into information disclosure and adversarial decision making in security and defense contexts, contributing to the operations management and behavioral decision analysis research in this domain. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Leverage Digital Platforms in Preventing Industrial Accidents: Evidence from a Multi-Level Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1177/10591478241305263</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; The embeddedness of digital platforms in firms to improve industrial accident prevention performance remains a challenge for safety management. A pressing question exists regarding appropriate pathways to improve firm accident prevention performance by leveraging digital platforms. Prior research focuses on individual and organizational factors to prevent industrial accidents while ignoring information technology (IT) from a holistic perspective. Following a socio-technical lens, this study fills the research gap by proposing a new conceptualization of technical and institutional components and examining their combined effects in shaping individual and organizational accident prevention outcomes (i.e., employee accident prevention competence and firm accident prevention performance). Specifically, we introduce and conceptualize the concept of digital platform affordance to represent the technical component and theorize the external institutional force ( government pressure) and the internal human agency ( top management support) as the institutional components of digital platforms. By integrating the socio-technical lens, IT affordance theory, and institutional theory, we develop a theoretical model to examine the interaction effects between digital platform affordance, government pressure, and top management support on accident prevention performance. We conduct a multilevel modeling approach to test the proposed research model using a fine-grained matched-pair survey from multiple respondents (i.e., employees and safety executives) in 161 industrial firms in China. We find that digital platform affordance enhances firm accident prevention performance by improving employee accident prevention competence. The results also indicate that the magnitude of the moderating effect of government pressure is contingent upon top management support. This study conceptualizes and assesses the role of digital platforms in safety management and indicates that the amalgamation of their technical/institutional components is a promising means to prevent industrial accidents. We also provide a new perspective for Operations Management scholars to reinterpret the socio-technical lens in the emerging digitally enabled safety management subdiscipline. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pricing and Service Fulfillment of Mobile Charging Systems With Stochastic Demands</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1177/10591478241310212</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; This study investigates the operations of a novel service model, mobile charging, in which an e-commerce platform operator dispatches trucks equipped with charging piles to provide charging services for customers’ electric vehicles with low battery levels. We model the platform-customer interaction with a Stackelberg game and explicitly characterize customers’ optimal charging decisions under the platform’s various service plans. In a general scenario that involves charging requests within a transportation network, we develop a joint optimization model for the platform’s pricing and service fulfillment, utilizing an elaborately constructed augmented network. In addition, we explore a localized subproblem where multiple orders are concentrated within a specific region. With a simplified model structure, we propose an approximation algorithm with provable performance guarantees and further theoretically evaluate the resource consumption and associated platform benefits for serving the orders in each region. The results enable the batching of neighboring demands within the general scenario as a specialized node, resulting in a streamlined network with fewer nodes. Additionally, we can enhance the algorithm’s efficiency within the general framework through strategic prioritization of node visitations, leveraging the analytical findings. Furthermore, the insights derived can offer recommendations for the deployment of mobile charging and the selection of target areas in the initial stages. Overall, our study provides comprehensive guidelines and valuable insights for mobile charging operations. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Optimal Payment for Dynamic Treatment Regimes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1177/10591478241306112</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; Dynamic treatment regimes improve health outcomes by tailoring each treatment to a patient’s evolving condition, but they also allow providers to learn and game the system over time. How should insurers pay? We study this new class of reimbursement problems, where the provider can privately learn and manipulate the progression of the patient’s condition. (i) We characterize the optimal payment policy: it internalizes two intertemporal effects of each treatment, and rewards provider honesty with incentive pay; moreover, it admits a simple implementation of risk-adjusted cost-sharing policy. (ii) We show that, ignoring dynamic learning and gaming, the existing payment models may have overestimated the harm of information asymmetry. Using the optimal policy, insurers only need to pay for initial private information; they can exploit provider uncertainty and elicit future private information at no cost. (iii) Our study informs U.S. healthcare payment reform with new insights; using two sets of real data, our study also quantifies when and why the optimal policy outperforms the existing ones. By highlighting the critical role of dynamic learning and gaming, this study advances our understanding of healthcare payment theory and practice. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Better Together or Divided Forever—Integrated or Hierarchical Material and Workload Control</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1177/10591478241305870</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; Offering bespoke products is the cornerstone of many competitive manufacturing strategies. The challenge for production control is allocating materials to individualized orders before they can be released to the shop floor. This requires joint evaluation of material inventory and workload control. However, these topics have been studied in isolation for [Formula: see text] years, under the presumption of a hierarchical control design. This traditionally had the practical advantage of a reduced need for real-time system information. With the advancements in Industry 4.0, control functions can now be integrated. We amalgamate knowledge from both disciplines, present hierarchical and integrated production control designs, and formulate material inventory policies tailored to pulled order release. Using simulation, we show that a decentralized and integrated production control design drastically reduces cost (at least 15%) and improves delivery performance in various settings. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reducing Modern Slavery Risks in Supply Chains: Contributions From a Sociotechnical Systems Perspective</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1177/10591478241309873</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; Using sociotechnical systems (STS) theory, this article offers a critical perspective on how the interplay between social and technical systems in supply chains can be leveraged to gain valuable insights into addressing risks related to modern slavery. It elaborates on the complex recursive interactions among various elements of STS, shedding light on the emergence, perpetuation, and diffusion of modern slavery, as well as the sociotechnical interventions available within supply chains. We develop a framework that conceptualizes the risk of modern slavery as the outcome of interactions among multiple systems, providing guidance for future research, policy development, and managerial strategies to address this pressing societal challenge. Importantly, multistakeholder initiatives, combining innovative approaches to both social and technical governance, are expected to play a crucial role in mitigating modern slavery risks. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Markovian Pricing With Price Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1177/10591478241306582</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; A stream of recent research considers the practice of random price discounts (a.k.a randomized pricing) when selling to forward-looking customers and shows that such pricing strategies can mitigate strategic customer waiting and boost seller profit. In practice, random price discounts are often offered together with price guarantees, in which customers are refunded the price difference if the price is lowered within a given time window after purchase. This paper investigates the efficacy of price guarantees under randomized pricing. To that end, we consider a model in which a firm adopts Markovian pricing and interacts with customers over an infinite time horizon. The following results are obtained. First, while Markovian pricing allows firms to price discriminate customers based on their monitoring costs, price guarantees further allow firms to price discriminate customers based on their willingness to pay. Second, offering price guarantees under Markovian pricing can help retain customers effectively by inducing high-valuation customers to purchase early, regardless of their arrival time. Third, even with price guarantees, Markovian pricing can dominate static pricing only when high-valuation customers are more likely to have a high monitoring cost, which illustrates that customer composition plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of the firm’s pricing strategy. Fourth, the optimal duration of price guarantees is closely related to customers’ lifetime duration. Finally, perhaps surprisingly, offering price guarantees can decrease the aggregate customer surplus since the firm offers sale prices less often under price guarantees. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>How Psychological Barriers Constrain Men’s Interest in Gender-Atypical Jobs and Facilitate Occupational Segregation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17550</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; Scholarship regarding occupational gender segregation has almost exclusively focused on women’s experiences (e.g., as targets of discrimination in masculine domains), yet understanding factors that perpetuate men’s underrepresentation in traditionally feminine occupations is equally important. We examine a consequential dynamic early in the job search process in which individuals come to learn that an occupation that fits them is perceived as feminine versus masculine. Our research develops and tests the prediction that femininity or masculinity of occupations will exert a stronger impact on men’s (versus women’s) interest in them such that men will be less interested in gender-atypical occupations than women. Across five studies (n = 4,477), we consistently observed robust evidence for this prediction among diverse samples, including high school students (Study 1), unemployed job seekers (Study 2), U.S. adults (Study 3), and undergraduates (Study 4) and using experimental and archival methods. We observed this asymmetry after controlling for alternative accounts related to economic factors (e.g., expected salary), suggesting that they alone cannot fully explain men’s lack of interest in feminine occupations as previously discussed in the literature. Further, we consistently observed that men, compared with women, show heightened sensitivity to gender-based occupational status, and this greater sensitivity explains men’s (versus women’s) reduced interest in gender-atypical occupations. Though past scholarship suggests that increasing pay is key to stoking men’s interest in feminine occupations, our research suggests that targeting men’s underlying psychological concern—sensitivity to gender-based occupational status—may be an underappreciated pathway to reducing gender segregation. &lt;/jats:p&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; Supplemental Material: The data, materials, preregistration, and ancillary analyses for all studies are available at https://osf.io/h4mgx/?view_only=9a4dbfc9d122417c880354d6b3462072 and at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17550 . &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Joint Bottom-up Method for Probabilistic Forecasting of Hierarchical Time Series</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2022.0113</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; In a stark departure from conventional wisdom, Nicolò Bertani, Shane T. Jensen, and Ville A. Satopää’s recently published research article titled “Joint Bottom-up Method for Probabilistic Forecasting of Hierarchical Time Series” dismantles a long-held belief in hierarchical forecasting: that the hierarchical structure itself contains vital information. The joint bottom-up (JBU) method proves otherwise. The authors demonstrate that the sums within a hierarchy—often seen as critical—add no additional information beyond what is contained in the most granular, bottom-level series. By modeling these bottom-level series jointly, JBU leverages their dependencies to deliver probabilistic forecasts that are both coherent and highly accurate across all levels of aggregation. This groundbreaking insight challenges decades of hierarchical forecasting practices. It underscores that upper-level series can be entirely reconstructed from the bottom-level series, rendering the hierarchy redundant. This finding, validated through real-world applications, sets a new standard for forecasting in fields like retail, energy, and tourism. Explore the full study to understand its far-reaching implications. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Things at Work: How Things Contribute to Performing Work</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/joms.13182</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;Abstract&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt;A crucial question for organizations is what constitutes work performance. While the importance of human competence and motivation to work performance has been established, less well understood is how ‘things’ – such as algorithms, tools, instruments, and raw materials – contribute to work performance. As ‘intelligent’ and ‘agentic’ technologies become further involved in work, it is increasingly important to understand the impact of things upon work performance. Although research adopting an entanglement perspective (e.g., practice theory, sociomateriality, affordances, science and technology studies) has convincingly demonstrated things are integral to work performance, there is a need for heightened clarity on &lt;jats:italic&gt;how&lt;/jats:italic&gt; things contribute to performing work. Informed by an ontology of things and drawing on an ethnographic study in the biotechnology industry, we propose things are constitutive of work performance in three interrelated ways: (1) by belonging to a nexus of useful things, (2) through performing interlinked roles, and (3) while co‐constituting work performance in concert with practitioners. Our theoretical and empirical account offers a more &lt;jats:italic&gt;integrative&lt;/jats:italic&gt; and &lt;jats:italic&gt;comprehensive understanding&lt;/jats:italic&gt; of how things are constitutive of work performance compared to the existing entanglement literature. This opens several new possibilities for enhancing work performance in organizations, which we outline in the paper.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>On the Folly of Rewarding Your Version of Performance: Signaling and the Double Empathy Problem in Pay‐For‐Performance Across Neurotypes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/hrm.22284</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt;As many organizations have sought to increase their neurodiversity, they have tended to focus on human resource (HR) practices and programs for increasing representation, especially of autistic employees. There has been comparatively less attention regarding HR practices that relate to sustaining employment and fostering workplace performance for autistic employees. Sustaining employment is a particular challenge because the signals sent by HR practices and the neurotypical managers implementing them are often differently interpreted by autistic employees—the double empathy problem. As the pay practices and pay‐for‐performance (PFP) systems critical to retention and career advancement have increasingly broadened beyond objective assessments of task performance to include more subjective assessments and contextual performance, the double empathy problem can worsen leading to unintended negative consequences. We draw upon signaling theory to theorize how and when PFP worsens or mitigates the double empathy problem. Specifically, we develop a model and set of propositions that posit how the attributes of signals (observability, consistency, and frequency), the resulting shared relevance of signals, their effects on behavior, and managers' subsequent interpretations of employee behavior and performance form a cycle through which performance‐reward signals tighten or loosen and, in turn, affect autistic employee well‐being and turnover. We close by discussing how our model may apply to other forms of neurodivergence and implications for future research regarding the practices, signals, and interpretations that create or inhibit environments supportive of neurodiversity.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;Abstract&lt;/jats:title&gt;
               &lt;jats:p&gt;We provide a finite sample inference method for the structural parameters of the semiparametric binary response model under a conditional median restriction originally studied by Manski (1975, 1985). This is achieved by exploiting distributional properties of observable outcomes conditional on the observed sequence of exogenous variables. Moment inequalities conditional on the size n sequence of exogenous covariates are constructed, and the proposed test statistic is a monotone function of violations of the corresponding sample moment inequalities. The critical value used for inference is provided by the appropriate quantile of a known function of n independent Bernoulli random variables, and does not require the use of a cube root asymptotic approximation employing a point estimator of the target parameter. Simulation studies demonstrate favorable finite sample performance of the test in comparison to several existing approaches. Empirical use is illustrated with an application to the classical setting of transportation choice.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

This paradigm allows voters to choose between directly voting and transitively delegating their votes to other voters so that those selected cast a vote weighted by the number of delegations that they received. In the epistemic setting, where voters decide on a binary issue for which there is a ground truth, previous work showed that a few voters may amass such a large amount of influence that liquid democracy is less likely to identify the ground truth than direct voting. We quantify the amount of permissible concentration of power and examine more realistic delegation models, showing that they behave well by ensuring that (with high probability) there is a permissible limit on the maximum number of delegations received. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the delegation process is similar to well-known processes on random graphs that are sufficiently bounded for our purposes. Along the way, we prove new bounds on the size of the largest component in an infinite Pólya urn process, which may be of independent interest. In addition, we empirically validate the theoretical results, running six experiments (for a total of N = 168 participants, 62 delegation graphs, and over 11,000 votes collected). We find that empirical delegation behaviors meet the conditions for our positive theoretical guarantees. Overall, our work alleviates concerns raised about liquid democracy and bolsters the case for the applicability of this emerging paradigm. &lt;/jats:p&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; This paper was accepted by Martin Bichler, market design, platform, and demand analytics. &lt;/jats:p&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; Funding: This work was supported by the Michael Hammer Fellowship, the Office of Naval Research [2016 Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, 2020 ONR Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, and Grant N00014-20-1-2488], the Office of Secretary of Defense [Grants ARO MURI W911NF-19-0217 and ARO W911NF-17-1-0592], Simons [Investigator Award 622132], the Open Philanthropy Foundation, and the National Science Foundation [Grants IIS-178108, CCF-1733556, CCF-1918421, CCF-2007080, IIS-1703846, and IIS-2024287].

      <title>Timing Complex News to Target Attention</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03722</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; Investors have limited and time-varying attention. These constraints are heterogeneous across investors, which can create asymmetric information and adverse selection problems. We show how firms take these constraints into account: They release harder-to-process news in periods when investor attention is higher. We use an institutional discontinuity within the U.S. corporate filing system to measure these effects. Filings before 5:30 p.m. become available immediately, whereas filings after 5:30 p.m. only become visible the next morning and attract less attention. Firms release longer and more complex news just before the cutoff, giving investors the longest possible period to absorb the information before markets open. Firms experience faster price convergence and more liquidity after precutoff news despite their complexity, which is consistent with the additional attention that they attract. We outline a framework in which the need for investors to spread their attention across different ideas induces firms to file their more complex filings at times when investor attention is higher. Our results are consistent with an equilibrium in which investors pay more attention to complex news and in which firms with complex news time them to target investor attention. &lt;/jats:p&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance. &lt;/jats:p&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03722 . &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Investor Perceptions of the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04750</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; The Inflation Reduction Act establishes a new 15% corporate minimum tax on the adjusted financial accounting income for large U.S. corporations. Although the minimum tax is estimated to raise $222 billion over 10 years, some fear firms will manipulate their accounting earnings to reduce their tax liabilities, resulting in less revenue raised. Using an event study, we examine the extent to which investors believe this tax will reduce firm value. We examine stock market reactions around key legislative developments leading to the enactment of the book minimum tax. Our findings show targeted firms experience significantly lower stock returns than nontargeted firms during the enactment process (about 1.4%–1.8% of firm value). In aggregate, our findings are consistent with the Joint Committee on Taxation’s revenue estimates. In cross-sectional tests, we fail to find evidence that firms most likely to avoid the tax via earnings management experience more positive returns. We also fail to find less negative returns for firms most likely to pass on the tax to consumers. Overall, our results suggest investors do not expect firms to avoid this tax. Instead, they appear to expect a significant portion of the corporate minimum tax to be remitted by firms and borne by shareholders. &lt;/jats:p&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting. &lt;/jats:p&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; Funding: F.

      <title>The High Cost of Cheap Talk: How Disingenuous Ethical Language Can Reflect Agency Costs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1177/01492063241305037</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; Does the use of a certain type of ethical language indicate that managers are failing to behave in a socially responsible manner? Managers are increasingly using language related to ethics, values, and corporate purpose in their communications with stakeholders. However, while economic models argue that “talk is cheap,” we predict that some ethical language (i.e., cheap talk) can reflect agency costs. That is, cheap talk reflects managers being disingenuous with stakeholders about their ethical intentions in order to reduce pressure on corporate social performance (CSP). We test this prediction by inductively creating a dictionary of cheap talk words and demonstrating that the use of cheap talk in annual reports (10-Ks) is associated with decreasing CSP. We also examine how monitoring by stakeholders concerned about CSP (specifically, security analysts and women board membership) can reduce this effect, and how certain types of executive compensation (specifically, exercisable and non-exercisable options) can either alleviate or worsen this effect. We contribute to the cheap talk literature (a subset of the impression management literature) by showing the high cost of disingenuous ethical language (i.e., cheap talk). We also add to the literature distinguishing between “values” and “legal” ethical talk by showing in post hoc analyses that words reflecting values are more likely to be cheap talk. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Silent Suffering: Using Machine Learning to Measure CEO Depression</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-679x.12590</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt;We introduce a novel measure of CEO depression by applying machine learning models that analyze vocal acoustic features from CEOs' conference call recordings. Our research was preregistered via the &lt;jats:italic&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/jats:italic&gt;'s registration‐based editorial process. In this study, we validate this measure and examine associated factors. We find that greater firm risk is positively associated with CEO depression, whereas higher job demands are negatively associated with CEO depression. Female and older CEOs show a lower likelihood of depression. Using this novel measure, we then explore the relationship between CEO depression and career outcomes. Although we do not find any evidence that CEO depression is associated with CEO turnover, we find some evidence that turnover‐performance sensitivity is higher among depressed CEOs. We also find limited evidence of higher compensation and higher pay‐performance sensitivity for depressed CEOs. This study provides new insights into the relationship between CEO mental health and career outcomes.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Unmasking Mutual Fund Derivative Use</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhaf001</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;Abstract&lt;/jats:title&gt;
               &lt;jats:p&gt;Using new SEC data, we study fund derivative use and its impact on performance. Despite small portfolio weights, derivatives contribute largely to fund returns. Contrary to prior research, we find most employ derivatives to amplify, not hedge, equity returns. Using machine learning to classify funds’ derivative strategies reveals high specializations linked to information-related trading, liquidity management, gaining exposure, or hedging motives. Long index derivative users drive the amplification. During COVID-19, these users significantly increased derivative use more than others and shifted strategies, but initially lost on existing positions and then on newly opened short positions when markets unexpectedly rebounded.

      <title>Inference with a Single Treated Cluster</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdaf002</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;Abstract&lt;/jats:title&gt;
               &lt;jats:p&gt;I introduce a generic method for inference about a scalar parameter in research designs with a finite number of heterogeneous clusters where only a single cluster received treatment. This situation is commonplace in difference-in-differences estimation but the test developed here applies more broadly. I show that the test controls size and has power under asymptotics where the number of observations within each cluster is large but the number of clusters is fixed. The test combines weighted, approximately Gaussian parameter estimates with a rearrangement procedure to obtain its critical values. The weights needed for most empirically relevant situations are tabulated in the paper. Calculation of the critical values is computationally simple and does not require simulation or resampling. The rearrangement test is highly robust to situations where some clusters are much more variable than others. Examples and an empirical application are provided.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>DOES A THEORY-OF-VALUE ADD VALUE? EVIDENCE FROM A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL WITH TANZANIAN ENTREPRENEURS</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17590</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; Entrepreneurs making decisions under uncertainty are encouraged to evaluate their initial ideas through hypothesis testing, but entrepreneurial approaches vary in their emphasis on ex-ante theory development prior to collecting evidence. In this paper, we examine whether and how entrepreneurs benefit from adopting an evidence-based approach or a theory-and-evidence-based approach to decision-making. We conducted a field experiment with Tanzanian agribusiness entrepreneurs by randomly assigning entrepreneurs to two different training conditions. We find that entrepreneurs in the theory-and-evidence-based condition have higher economic performance during the observation period following the intervention. We conjecture this result stems from differences in the types of changes enacted: entrepreneurs in the theory-and-evidence-based training make more coordinated changes that encompass both core and operational elements of their business models. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>How Social Movements Catalyze Firm Innovation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17497</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt; We investigate the impact social movements have on firm innovation through private politics. We argue that firms strategically respond to private politics by investing in new technologies that address movement-advocated issues material to firms’ performance. While both contentious private politics—when activists contentiously target firms—and cooperative private politics—when activists and firms collaborate—catalyze innovation, they do so in different ways. Contentious private politics increases the amount of innovation firms undertake by drawing managerial attention to movement-advocated issues material to the firm prompting search for solutions to those issues. Conversely, cooperative private politics provides firms access to new knowledge which encourages firms to search for solutions in areas more distant from their existing knowledge, in so doing, increase innovation involving distant recombination on material issues. We find support for our arguments in a matched sample of firms contentiously targeted, and with activist collaborations, on climate change issues, and firms that were not targets of private politics on those issues but had otherwise similar histories of climate-related innovation and relationships with climate movements and other environmental movements. Supplementary analyses corroborate the mechanisms that undergird our theoretical predictions: contentious private politics is associated more innovation closer to a firm’s expertise while cooperative private politics is associated with innovations that draw on more distant knowledge. We also find that when collaboration follows contention their respective impacts on innovation are reduced which may result from firms seeking collaborations for their legitimacy-granting benefits after contention rather than the learning opportunities they offer. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>

      <title>Inscribing Impact: Measurement Practices in the Making of Moral Markets</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/joms.13184</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;jats:title&gt;Abstract&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt;Moral markets, designed to generate positive impact on pressing social and environmental challenges, are transforming traditional market practices by including more than economic considerations in their operations. The importance of these markets continues to grow as investors, regulators, and consumers increasingly put pressure on companies to account for their broader social and environmental impacts. However, the absence of standardized norms and tools to measure impact may erode trust and lead to ‘impact washing’. This paper examines the process of impact inscription – how actors embed their principles, objectives, and values into artefacts such as measurement tools that shape moral market practices. Drawing on qualitative, in‐depth data from Spain's emerging impact investing market, we unpack impact inscription and identify three key mechanisms: demarcating moral market boundaries, accounting for social issues, and redefining governance structures. By driving changes in scope, roles, and incentives, these mechanisms influence the emergence of moral markets and can result in either disruptive change (with the risk of paralysis) or incremental change (with the risk of goal displacement). Our study also prompts a deeper reflection on how measurement tools embed value judgments, shaping how markets internalize social and environmental externalities and integrate them into market exchanges.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</description>
