    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the optimal design of bank capital regulations when capital markets are subject to adverse selection. I show how the implementation of capital requirements can eliminate the information frictions that make raising capital costly by screening banks to reveal their private information to the market. The optimal regulations induce information revelation via recapitalization programs when the banking sector is weak and pool the banks’ private information via uniform capital requirements otherwise. Optimal capital requirements are linked to the securities issued to meet them, demonstrating potential welfare gains from incorporating more and less informationally sensitive securities into the design of capital regulations. Finally, the analysis generates insights for the joint design of equity capital requirements and additional tier 1 capital securities. (JEL D82, G21, G28)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and the accompanying societal and economic benefits will greatly depend on how much liability AV firms will have to carry for accidents involving these vehicles, which in turn impacts their insurability and associated insurance premiums. Across three experiments (N= 2677), we investigate whether accidents where the AV was not at fault could become an unexpected liability risk for AV firms, by exploring consumer perceptions of AV liability. We find that when such accidents occur, the not‐at‐fault vehicle becomes more salient to consumers when it is an AV. As a result, consumers are more likely to view as relevant counterfactuals in which the not‐at‐fault vehicle might have behaved differently to avoid or minimize damage from, the accident. This leads them to judge AV firms as more liable than both firms that make human‐driven vehicles and human drivers for damages when not at fault.</content>

    <title>Breaking Through Only to Break up: A Cross‐Country Analysis of the Speed of Advancement and Exit of Female Executives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the speed of advancements and exits of female executive directors vis‐à‐vis comparable men. In line with recent research, we suggest that women are likely to experience an apparent gender‐based advantage in the form of lower age at the time of their first‐ever executive director appointment. However, we argue that this advantage may be transitory. Appointed women also experience faster exits from these positions, with age partially mediating the differential speed of exits between male and female executive directors. We also contend that these effects are contingent on countries' local gender norms (especially women's economic participation) such that lower gender parity leads to even lower ages at appointments and faster exits for female executive directors. Results based on 15,202 unique rookie executive directors from 33 countries between 2002 and 2015 largely support these predictions.</content>

    <title>Building Micro‐Foundations for Positive Workplace Relationships: Validation of a Strategic Relational Human Resource Management Measure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A growing number of studies have recognized the pivotal role of relational Human Resource Management (HRM) systems in fostering positive interpersonal relationships in the workplace. These systems are tailored to fulfill specific relational objectives through collective‐level mechanisms. However, there has been a notable neglect of strategies for establishing the general foundations of positive workplace relationships and the contributions of individual actors in relationship‐building activities. Drawing upon the multilevel micro‐foundational structure framework and strategic human capital theory, this study introduces and validates a new measure of strategic relational HRM (SRHRM) systems. This measure incorporates a set of interrelated HRM practices aimed at reinforcing individual employees' relational knowledge, skills, and abilities, which serve as micro‐foundations for the development and maintenance of workplace relationships. Our methodology encompasses a meticulous validation process for the SRHRM measure. This involves employing four diverse samples from North America and Asia to assess its content validity, internal consistency, convergent and discriminant validity, as well as criterion‐related validity. Our findings provide substantial support for the application of the SRHRM measure in future empirical investigations.</content>

    <title>The Earnings and Labor Supply of U.S. Physicians</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Is government guiding the invisible hand at the top of the labor market? We use new administrative data to measure physicians’ earnings and estimate the influence of healthcare policies on these earnings, physicians’ labor supply, and allocation of talent. Combining the administrative registry of U.S. physicians with tax data, Medicare billing records, and survey responses, we find that physicians’ annual earnings average $350,000 and comprise 8.6% of national healthcare spending. Business income comprises one-quarter of earnings and is systematically underreported in survey data. Earnings increase steeply early in the career, and there are major differences across specialties, regions, and firm sizes. The geographic pattern of earnings is unusual compared with other workers. We argue that these patterns reflect policy choices to subsidize demand for physician care, amplified by restrictions on physician entry, especially in certain specialties. Health policy has a major impact on the margin:  25% of physician fee revenue driven by Medicare reimbursements accrues to physicians personally. Physicians earn 8% of public money spent on insurance expansion. These policies in turn affect the type and quantity of medical care physicians supply, retirement timing, and the allocation of talent across specialties.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Design and Analysis of Efficient Sequencing Policies for Linear Cold Storage Devices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we investigate the problem of sequencing data requests for linear devices, such as magnetic tapes, to minimize response time in cold-storage solutions for archival data. Tapes are the technology of choice for long-term storage due to their reliability, low costs, security, and significant energy savings. However, physical limitations on tape pose challenges to policy implementation, which must be scalable on low-power hardware. We provide a theoretical and numerical analysis of existing policies and introduce new ones, identifying cases where each is applicable and evaluating their theoretical performance in terms of the number of requested files. In particular, we show that the standard first-in, first-out (FIFO) policy can be arbitrarily inefficient and investigate novel constant-ratio approximations and polynomial-time procedures. If data on the frequency with which each file is accessed is available, we consider a dynamic programming procedure to minimize a stochastic variant of the problem, providing a constant-time approximation for arbitrary file requests. We also investigate a quality criterion based on makespan and explore online variants of the problem. Our numerical analysis, conducted on both synthetic and real-world data from an industry partner, offers insights into when each policy is most appropriate, identifying cases where the proposed algorithms significantly outperform traditional policies, like FIFO, in terms of average reading times. This study has managerial implications, as current data retrieval practices in data centers are often limited to traditional policies with unknown theoretical performance. Our methodological and numerical analysis provides evidence of the value in appropriately sequencing requests based on tape structure, guiding algorithm choice and highlighting underlying trade-offs in response times.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Quality, Necessity, or Accessibility? Impact of Dockless Bike Sharing on Ineffective Use of Medical Resources</title>
    <updated>2025-01-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, patients have increasing autonomy in medical decision-making. With great autonomy in selecting medical institutions, patients with low-risk diseases (LRD) may opt for treatment in prestigious hospitals, which limits the access of patients with high-risk diseases (HRD) to these hospitals. Moreover, due to limited medical knowledge and a fear of uncertainty regarding diseases, patients with greater medical autonomy may request various unnecessary medical tests to alleviate their health-related anxiety. This study takes a novel patients’ perspective to investigate how dockless bike sharing, which addresses the “last-mile problem” and improves geographical accessibility to medical institutions, affects two types of ineffective use of medical resources: disease-institution mismatch and overuse of medical tests. By introducing the concept of quality-accessibility trade-off in patients’ decision-making processes, we shed light on the psychological mechanism underlying the effect of dockless bike sharing on patients’ medical institution choices. We also introduce a new concept, perceived necessity of medical tests, to explain how dockless bike sharing reduces unnecessary medical tests. In Study 1, we designed a quasi-experiment and applied a difference-in-differences model based on real-world electronic health record data to show that dockless bike sharing increased the likelihood of patients choosing hospitals over clinics and decreased the number of unnecessary medical tests. In Studies 2a, 2b, 3a, and 3b, four randomized controlled experiments were employed to replicate the findings and reveal the underlying mechanisms. In sum, we found that dockless bike sharing acted as a “double-edged sword” in terms of its impact on exacerbating disease-institution mismatch and alleviating the overuse of medical tests. This study makes significant theoretical contributions to the Operations Management (OM), sharing economy, and medical resource management literature. It also offers important managerial insights for governments, shared mobility platforms, and healthcare providers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Designing E-commerce Livestreams: How Product Presentation Duration Affects Sales?</title>
    <updated>2025-01-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Livestream e-commerce has emerged as a novel way to promote and sell products. This channel differs from existing promotion channels like TV/ online video advertising because viewers voluntarily consume the content on this channel and are highly engaged due to social interactivity with the livestreamer and other viewers. A key design aspect of product promotions is the duration for which a product is presented during a livestream session. In this paper, we empirically study the impact of product presentation duration by analyzing a unique dataset from two of the largest livestream shopping platforms in China. We find that when the product duration is longer, product revenue is higher. However, as the average presentation time increases, the session revenue decreases. The role of presentation duration in driving sales may differ between official (single-brand) livestreams sponsored by brands and third-party (multi-brand) livestreams. On analyzing the heterogeneous effects between official and third-party livestreams, we find that the positive impact on product-level sales is largely driven by third-party livestreams. On the other hand, both official and third-party livestreams can improve session-level sales by reducing the average product duration in a session. Thus, in the context of third-party livestreams, we observe a tension between the incentives of the brands (advertisers) whose goal is to drive an individual product’s sales and third-party livestreamers whose goal is to maximize total sales in a session. Our findings have useful implications for the design of e-commerce livestreams.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the multi-armed bandit framework, there are two formulations that are commonly employed to handle time-varying reward distributions: adversarial bandit and nonstationary bandit. Although their oracles, algorithms, and regret analysis differ significantly, we provide a unified formulation in this paper that smoothly bridges the two as special cases. The formulation uses an oracle that takes the best action sequences within a switch budget. Depending on the switch budget, it turns into the oracle in hindsight in the adversarial bandit and the dynamic oracle in the nonstationary bandit. We provide algorithms that attain the optimal regret with the matching lower bound. The optimal regret displays distinct behavior in two regimes.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Impact of Industrial and Geographical Concentrations of Upstream Industries on Firm Performance During COVID-19</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a large sample of supplier-firm relationships, we develop new measures to operationalize the industrial and geographical concentrations of firms' upstream industries. The developed measures show an upstream industry might be competitive and contain many suppliers (low industrial concentration) and yet be concentrated in a few countries (high geopolitical concentration) or a small geographical area (high geographical concentration), thus leaving the downstream firm vulnerable to geographical or geopolitical disruptions. Using COVID-19 as an exogenous shock, we document that the firms whose upstream suppliers are operating in industries that have high concentration (either geographically or geopolitically), on average, experienced a reduction of 250 million US dollars in quarterly sales. Thus, competitive industries with ample suppliers may still impose significant risks on downstream firms if the upstream suppliers' industries are concentrated mainly in a few countries or small geographical areas. Noteworthy, we find evidence that the link between upstream suppliers' industry-level concentrations and downstream firms' sales growth is heterogeneous. Specifically, firms can mitigate the negative relationship by adjusting their supply chain networks. The negative relationship is weaker for firms with a geopolitically diversified supply base and firms with more domestic suppliers. Our estimates are robust and consistently identified through several different empirical strategies. Our findings help policymakers and managers to systematically identify locations in supply networks that have the potential to create bottlenecks that may even threaten national security. Additionally, the proposed measures give policymakers insights into which industries to support for onshoring.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a model in which a low monetary policy rate lowers the cost of corporate debt, potentially spurring productive investment; low interest rates, however, also induce firms to lever up so as to increase payouts to equity. Whereas such leveraged payouts privately benefit shareholders, leverage comes at the social cost of distorting their incentives, thereby lowering productivity and discouraging investment. If leverage is unregulated (for example, because of the presence of a shadow banking system), then the optimal monetary policy seeks to contain such socially costly leveraged payouts by stimulating investment in response to adverse shocks only up to a level below the first best. The optimal monetary policy may even consist of leaning against the wind, that is, not stimulating the economy at all, in order to fully contain leveraged payouts and maintain productive efficiency.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01440 .</content>

    <title>Using Subsidies, Fines, and Restitution with Budget Balance to Combat Digital Piracy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite utilizing technical prevention methods and enacting copyright protection legislation, digital piracy has remained a persistent problem. We examine policy remedies to digital piracy whereby the policymaker has to balance its budget between fines on detected pirates, subsidies for legal purchases, and restitution to the firm. In our model, users choose whether to subscribe, copy, or not use the good, a firm decides on subscription fee and quality, and a policymaker determines subsidies, fines, and restitution. We find that the firm’s subscription fee is always increasing in subsidies, fines, and restitution under a budget balance constraint. The impact of these policy instruments on the firm’s investment in quality depends on how user marginal utility is influenced by the quality of the good and how the policymaker redistributes fines back to society, if at all. Using two specific functional forms with additive and multiplicative utility, we explain how these factors come into play. With additive utility, fines increase the firm’s investment in quality. However, with multiplicative utility the firm’s investment in quality decreases with fines if fines are used alone or alongside subsidies. In contrast to prior research, findings of our general framework illustrate that imposing fines on detected pirates “can” be socially optimal when accounting for the policymaker’s budget balance. Our specific functional forms also serve as two instances where imposing fines is always welfare maximizing. Finally, we find that although the policymaker’s optimal intervention improves social welfare and mitigates digital piracy, it leads to a reduction in consumer surplus.This paper was accepted by Hemant Bhargava, information systems.Funding: This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [Grant 435-2016-0431].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03463 .</content>

    <title>ChatGPT for Textual Analysis? How to Use Generative LLMs in Accounting Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative large language models (GLLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 by OpenAI, are emerging as powerful tools for textual analysis tasks in accounting research. GLLMs can solve any textual analysis task solvable using nongenerative methods as well as tasks previously only solvable using human coding. Whereas GLLMs are new and powerful, they also come with limitations and present new challenges that require care and due diligence. This paper highlights the applications of GLLMs for accounting research and compares them with existing methods. It also provides a framework on how to effectively use GLLMs by addressing key considerations, such as model selection, prompt engineering, and ensuring construct validity. In a case study, I demonstrate the capabilities of GLLMs by detecting nonanswers in earnings conference calls, a traditionally challenging task to automate. The new GPT method achieves an accuracy of 96% and reduces the nonanswer error rate by 70% relative to the existing Gow et al. (2021) method. Finally, I discuss the importance of addressing bias, replicability, and data sharing concerns when using GLLMs. Taken together, this paper provides researchers, reviewers, and editors with the knowledge and tools to effectively use and evaluate GLLMs for academic research.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: Supported by the Foster School of Business – University of Washington.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03253 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Product Returns and Assortment Decisions: a Strategic Analysis of Online and Offline Competition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present a model of product returns and assortment decisions in the context of online-offline retail competition. In equilibrium, the online store optimally offers easy-to-fit products to reduce costly returns. The competing brick-and-mortar store faces a subtle trade-off between generating higher sales and attracting more foot traffic, and thus, it might use its limited store size to stock harder-to-fit products. Our model provides a rationale for the prevalence of relatively lower-quality products sold online and the steady growth of specialty stores within the changing footprint of traditional retailing. The model is extended to include possibilities such as a physical store opening an online channel to compete with the online store.We apply this framework to investigate the possibility and consequences of retailers collaborating to handle returns. Specifically, a recent “buy online and return in store” (BORS) return policy allows consumers to return online purchases directly to a competing brick-and-mortar store. In the short run, BORS increases the BMR’s foot traffic and the returns volume. In the long run, BORS expands the OR’s assortment and increases BMR’s foot traffic. BORS can be sustained in the long run if the BMR is small or if its cost-saving effect is large.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: From Streetwear to High Fashion: How Nonelite Producers Use Hybridization to Enter an Elite Category</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Gaining access to elite categories is challenging for nonelite producers. My longitudinal analysis of the evolution of the fashion market explains how some nonelite streetwear producers gained access to the elite high fashion category by creating an interstitial hybrid category—luxury streetwear—that bridged the two. Nonelite producers create a hybrid category by establishing commensurability with the elite category and generating appeal through cultural consonance. The hybrid category challenges the elite boundary while potentializing value creation for elites. In response, elite producers subsume the hybrid category, which resolves the challenge posed by nonelite producers and allows elites to capture the value introduced by nonelites by absorbing and exerting control over them. By doing so, elite producers rejuvenate their category’s cultural relevance and strengthen its elite status, while some nonelite producers gain access to the elite category. I contribute to research by theorizing nonelites’ status gains through categorical hybridization, an empirically prevalent but undertheorized phenomenon. I then leverage my theoretical insights to explain why subsumption solves cooptation issues, distinguish between collective and collaborative market driving, suggest that market actors can concomitantly participate in market maintenance and change, and offer managerial recommendations for nonelites to solidify status gains.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Accounting for Formative and Reflective Topics in Product Review Data for Better Consumer Insights</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Observations of product and service reviews suggest that textual product reviews may contain statements that talk about the overall experience (“We had a great time”) or, similarly, whether to recommend a particular product. We argue that such statements encapsulate an overall assessment and hence are not independently informative about, but rather reflect overall ratings. We propose a model that allows for the distinction between topics that contribute to and topics that merely reflect an overall evaluation and apply it to a data set consisting of luxury hotel reviews. Compared to a standard supervised LDA, we find our model to better fit the data and to improve customer insights by resulting in more semantically coherent topics which point at specific aspects with positive and negative relationships to customers' evaluation of their experience.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Customer-Centric Contract Changes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Customers would frequently benefit from changes to an existing purchase contract with a supplier (e.g., due to a wrong order). Salespeople can voluntarily make such a change, which we label a “customer-centric contract change.” Formally, we define a customer-centric contract change as an act of a salesperson of amending the purchase contract in the customer’s favor without a legal obligation to do so. Since literature has neglected this prevalent and important phenomenon, we draw on social exchange theory to study the impact of such contract changes on relationship performance. Toward this end, we leverage panel data on over 57,000 customers, four experiments, and a survey study. Results suggest customer-centric contract changes increase relationship performance because customers are grateful for a salesperson’s relinquishing of power. Interestingly, this effect is less pronounced in close exchange relationships where a norm of solidarity between customers and salespeople exists. These findings add to emergent work that finds that business partners in close exchange relationships expect each other and are willing to forgo power advantages to alleviate each other’s hardships; we integrate these findings into what we coin “power-solidarity theory.” For practitioners, the findings offer guidance on whether and how to approve contract change requests.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research on status signaling reveals that consumers may select subtle or overt signals to convey their social status. In this research, the authors build on this insight in the context of auditory signaling and show that consumers use product volume as a status signal. Using the Dominance-Prestige Account of Rank Allocation framework, the authors propose that the path consumers take to achieve status will influence their choice of loud or quiet products. A combination of quantitative models, a lab experiment and a conjoint study demonstrates that consumers pursuing status via dominance are more likely to choose relatively louder products, while those who use a prestige path are more likely to choose relatively quieter products. The authors further demonstrated a boundary condition for prestige-driven consumers, the presence of other signals of social rank, such as education or profession. When no other markers of their social rank are present prestige-driven people reduce their preference for quiet signals (Study 4).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The blockchain technology can generate decentralized consensus, hence enhancing the verifiability and contractability of payoff-relevant states in a distribution channel or supply chain (e.g., seller cost and/or buyer value). Therefore, smart contracts can be written between supply chain partners such that transactions are automatically executed at state-dependent prices. We examine the economic impacts of blockchain-enabled smart contracts on the equilibrium generation and allocation of surplus in a three-level supply chain. Our model highlights the role of smart contract in removing ex post asymmetric decision right, which is otherwise inherently present under regular contracts where trade decisions are made based on constant transfer prices. As a result, the seller (under cost uncertainty) or the buyer (under value uncertainty) may hurt itself by signing a smart with the middleman, despite the improvement in the supply chain's total efficiency and surplus. Therefore, the equilibrium choice of smart contract can be socially insufficient. Moreover, interestingly, a prisoner's dilemma may arise: the seller's and the buyer's dominant choice is the regular contract, whereas everyone would be better off if the smart contract is jointly adopted by all parties.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Natural Affect DEtection (NADE): Using Emojis to Infer Emotions from Text</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Emotions are central to consumer communications, and extracting them from user-generated online content is crucial for marketers, considering that such consumer opinions significantly shape brand perceptions, influence purchase decisions, and provide essential insights for marketing analytics. To leverage vast user-generated data, marketers and researchers require advanced text-to-emotion converters. However, existing tools for fine-grained emotion extraction face several limitations: Lexica are constrained by their dictionaries, machine learning models by human-annotated training data, and large language models by insufficient validation. As a result, marketing research still tends to rely on mere sentiment detection instead of extracting more nuanced emotions from text. This paper introduces Nade (Natural Affect DEtection), a novel text-to-emoji-to-emotion converter that first “emojifies” language and then converts these emojis into intensity measures of well-established, theory-grounded emotions. This approach addresses the limitations of existing tools by leveraging the inherent emotional information in emojis. Using human raters and state-of-the-art converters as benchmarks, the authors establish the benefits of exploiting emojis, validate Nade, and demonstrate its use in several marketing applications using data from various social media platforms. Users can apply the proposed converter through an easy-to-use online app and programming packages for Python and R.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The author explores how racial alignment between film critics and movie casts affects critic ratings and their market implications. Testing the hypothesis of cultural affinity, this research finds that critics’ ratings tend to decrease as the proportion of Black cast members increases, but this effect is mitigated when the critic is Black. A text analysis of critics’ review excerpts suggests the presence of two tenets of cultural affinity: cultural literacy and cultural identity. An online survey further demonstrates that, in the absence of self-selection, Black respondents perceive greater affinity toward movies featuring predominantly Black casts and assign higher ratings to trailers featuring racially similar casts. Two additional analyses show that critic ratings have market consequences: as the proportion of Black cast members rises, critic ratings diverge more from audience choices (box office revenue) and audience ratings, though this effect is mitigated when the critics are Black. These findings underscore the importance of racial diversity in promoting culturally representative content in the marketplace.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Lower Artificial Intelligence Literacy Predicts Greater AI Receptivity</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As artificial intelligence (AI) transforms society, understanding factors that influence AI receptivity is increasingly important. The current research investigates which types of consumers have greater AI receptivity. Contrary to expectations revealed in four surveys, cross country data and six additional studies find that people with lower AI literacy are typically more receptive to AI. This lower literacy-greater receptivity link is not explained by differences in perceptions of AI’s capability, ethicality, or feared impact on humanity. Instead, this link occurs because people with lower AI literacy are more likely to perceive AI as magical and experience feelings of awe in the face of AI’s execution of tasks that seem to require uniquely human attributes. In line with this theorizing, the lower literacy-higher receptivity link is mediated by perceptions of AI as magical and is moderated among tasks not assumed to require distinctly human attributes. These findings suggest that companies may benefit from shifting their marketing efforts and product development towards consumers with lower AI literacy. Additionally, efforts to demystify AI may inadvertently reduce its appeal, indicating that maintaining an aura of magic around AI could be beneficial for adoption.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use attribution theory to understand how people evaluate a company when another company in the same business network does something wrong. In studying business groups, we find that when one company affiliated with a group commits wrongdoing, the strategies used by other affiliated companies to manage how they are evaluated are only effective when they use tactics that differ from those used by the deviant firm. Specifically, results from three experimental studies suggest that affiliated firms should use differentiated technical and ceremonial impression management tactics to help evaluators distinguish between innocent and deviant companies. Our findings also reveal the conditions for such successful differentiation, demonstrating that it is particularly effective when companies have a history of wrongdoing but can backfire if external stakeholders become aware that these actions are intentionally coordinated. Our findings provide novel insights into the impression management literature by exploring the dynamic interplay between the impression management strategies of connected but noncompeting organizations. We also contribute to the business group literature by revealing the delicacy of coordinating affiliates.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We empirically analyze firm‐level uncertainty generated from extreme weather events, guided by a theoretical framework. Stock options of firms with establishments in a hurricane's (forecast) landfall region exhibit large implied volatility increases, reflecting significant uncertainty (before) after impact. Volatility risk premium dynamics reveal that investors underestimate such uncertainty. This underreaction diminishes for hurricanes after Sandy, a salient event that struck the U.S. financial center. Despite constituting idiosyncratic shocks, hurricanes affect hit firms' expected stock returns. Textual analysis of calls between firm management, analysts, and investors reveals that discussions about hurricane impacts remain elevated throughout the long‐lasting high‐uncertainty period after landfall.</content>

    <title>The Signaling Effect of Biophilic Job Posts: Do Applicants Trade Green for Green?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Contemporary job postings increasingly rely on visual content to attract applicants through social media platforms, calling for scholarly attention to organizational aesthetics in recruitment. This study accordingly examines the signaling function of biophilic workspace design conveyed in job posts. We integrate theorizing on organizational aesthetics and biophilia with signaling theory to posit that biophilic job posts serve a dual signaling role as both a stimulus of signal attention by eliciting a visceral response and as a signaled source of credible information by evoking an evolutionary disposed cognitive interpretation. More specifically, we model pleasure and arousal as an indicator of stimulated attention, organizational attraction and the willingness to trade pay as evaluated responses to the signal, and attributions of communal organizational traits as an intervening interpretation of the signal—consistent with the role of symbolic attributes in prospective applicant evaluation of organizations. Three primary experiments largely support our predictions. Overall, this research extends the function of aesthetic signals to organizational signaling, validates organizational aesthetics as a stimulus of directed evaluation, and expands the scope of biophilic theory in organizational research. Findings also inform the practical question of whether biophilic job posts function as a non‐pecuniary differentiator in recruitment.</content>

    <title>Navigating the Talent Retention Puzzle: The Role of Workgroup Identification and On‐the‐Job Embeddedness</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations implement talent management (TM) programs to improve retention. However, results are mixed on whether these programs reduce talent turnover. Applying the social identity theory, we predicted that talent nomination in a TM program reduces workgroup identification and increases turnover intention. We also hypothesized that on‐the‐job embeddedness mitigates this unintended effect. Our three‐wave survey study, conducted over 2 years with 352 employees at a multinational machinery manufacturing company in China, included 45 employees recently identified as talents. Results showed that talents had lower workgroup identification than their non‐talent peers, but this did not lead to higher turnover intention. We found that on‐the‐job embeddedness had a moderating role: talents with low embeddedness reported lower workgroup identification and higher turnover intention than non‐talents, whereas those with high embeddedness showed no such difference. This study highlights that TM programs can prompt thoughts of leaving among talents; however, job embeddedness can buffer these negative effects.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fair and Efficient Allocation Algorithms Do Not Require Knowing Exact Item ValuesFood rescue organizations are tasked with allocating often-unpredictable donations to recipients who need it. For a large class of recipient valuation functions, this can be done in a fair and efficient manner as long as each recipient reports their value for each arriving donation. In practice, however, such valuations are rarely elicited. In “Dynamic Fair Division with Partial Information,” Benadè, Halpern, and Psomas ask whether simultaneous fairness and efficiency remain possible when the allocator receives limited information about recipient valuations, even as little as a single binary signal. For recipients with i.i.d. or correlated values, the paper provides an algorithm which is envy-free and 1-epsilon welfare-maximizing with high probability. Asymptotically tight results are also established for independent, nonidentical agents. This shows that fair and efficient online allocation algorithms do not critically rely on recipients being able to precisely report their utility functions.</content>

    <title>You’ve Got Mail! The Late 19th Century U.S. Postal Service Expansion, Firm Creation, and Firm Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of the expansion of the U.S. Postal Service in the late 19th century on firm creation and performance. Utilizing newly digitized archival data on historic business establishments, post office locations, and road networks in California, our study identifies a positive relationship between the expansion of the Postal Service and the emergence of new firms. To address endogeneity concerns, we leverage an unexpected change in the Postal Service route network. Our findings suggest that the Postal Service played a significant role in facilitating firm entry by acting as a carrier of specialized knowledge rather than as a financial service or mass communication infrastructure. We further reveal that, although increased competition from new entrants generally exerted downward pressure on incumbent firms, those relying on specialized knowledge and public technology inputs significantly benefited from local Postal Service access. Taken together, our study underscores the critical role played by the Postal Service in knowledge diffusion and local economic development by enabling the sourcing of specialized knowledge and technologies from other geographies. Overall, our results contribute to a broader understanding of how communication and knowledge dissemination infrastructure can drive entrepreneurship and firm growth, carrying important implications for contemporary discussions on infrastructure development, its potential to stimulate entrepreneurial activity, innovation, and foster local economic communities.This paper was accepted by Olav Sorenson, organizations.Funding: The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the Harvard Business School Division of Research and Faculty Development.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03369 .</content>

    <title>Impact of OM Content in Earnings Calls on a Firm’s Stock Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate whether and to what extent financial markets value and respond to operations management (OM)-related information in quarterly earnings calls directed toward financial market participants. We develop and use a novel construct called “stated OM focus” (SOMF) to mine the incidence of and emphasis on OM information in the quarterly earnings conference calls for a large cross-section of firms (S&amp;P 1500) over a time frame of 15 years. We empirically establish the value-relevance of OM information as well as summarize and capture both explanatory and predictive aspects of the OM function’s contribution to firm value. We show that OM-related information disclosed by firms systematically, significantly, positively, and persistently affects abnormal stock returns after controlling for known covariates and controls (financial metrics, standard OM metrics, firm and time effects, and lexical-structure related) and after accounting for earnings surprise. Furthermore, we find evidence that firms’ stated OM focus bears significant predictive power in the short term. Long-short portfolios, created using a sorting signal derived solely from stated OM-focus information, predict future abnormal returns consistently over one, two and three months forward from the earnings call event. We show that the OM information metric is reliable and bears internal, external, and predictive validity. These findings offer useful implications for firms, financial market participants, and OM function stakeholders.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02221 .</content>

    <title>Multicell Experiments for Marginal Treatment Effect Estimation of Digital Ads</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Randomized experiments with treatment and control groups are an important tool to measure the impacts of interventions. However, in experimental settings with one-sided noncompliance extant empirical approaches may not produce the estimands a decision maker needs to solve the problem of interest. For example, these experimental designs are common in digital advertising settings but typical methods do not yield effects that inform the intensive margin: how many consumers should be reached or how much should be spent on a campaign. We propose a solution that combines a novel multicell experimental design with modern estimation techniques that enables decision makers to solve problems with an intensive margin. Our design is straightforward to implement and does not require additional budget. We illustrate our method through simulations calibrated using an advertising experiment at Facebook, demonstrating its superior performance in various scenarios and its advantage over direct optimization approaches.This paper was accepted by Jean-Pierre Dubé, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01185 .</content>

    <title>Subcoalition Cluster Analysis: A New Method for Modeling Conflict in Organizations</title>
    <updated>2025-01-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The renewed interest among managers and management researchers in stakeholder governance has also underscored the shortage of quantitative methods available for studying business firms as political systems. A critical problem for researchers applying coalition-based theories of organizational politics to observational data is that the units of analysis, coined “subcoalitions,” are often unobservable. This paper introduces subcoalition cluster analysis (SCA) as a new computational framework for analyzing intrafirm conflict that permits researchers to model groups of heterogeneous actors in terms of a smaller set of representative subcoalitions. The SCA approach to identifying latent fault-lines among groups of actors is based on widely held ideas in management research about the structure of intrafirm coalition politics, is computationally practicable in settings with many alternatives or actors, and can be straightforwardly applied to observational settings with incomplete data on actor preferences. We then apply SCA to two cases in which an organization characterized by multiple, partially inconsistent goals and stakeholders with heterogeneous preferences face a politically contested decision. In both cases, we first analyze preference data using SCA to identify the subcoalition structure that best characterizes the set of actors in the organization. We then use the SCA output as a dependent variable in an analysis of the predictors of subcoalition membership in the first case and as an independent variable in an analysis of the changing patterns of social influence in the second.This paper was accepted by Lamar Pierce, organizations.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.00013 .</content>

    <title>Food categorization determines whether healthier food is inferred to be tastier or less tasty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite evidence that people believe that the unhealthier the food, the tastier it is, some studies also suggest the opposing belief—the healthier the food, the tastier it is. A framework is proposed to reconcile this contradiction, and four studies demonstrate that the discrete categorization of foods as healthful versus unhealthful determines which intuition consumers use. When stereotypically unhealthy foods (e.g., candies, ice cream, hot dogs) are encountered, they are automatically categorized as unhealthful and the properties associated with that category (e.g., sweetness, saltiness, fat content) become accessible. Inferences about taste are then based on these properties and the unhealthier the encountered products are (i.e., the higher the sugar and fat content they have), the tastier they are perceived to be (unhealthy = tasty belief). Conversely, when stereotypically healthful foods (e.g., fruits) are encountered, other properties (e.g., freshness, vitamins) become salient, and tastiness is mainly inferred based on these properties, leading to the inference that the healthier these foods are (i.e., the more freshness and vitamins they have), the tastier they are perceived to be (healthy = tasty belief). Marketers and policymakers can leverage these findings to understand better when emphasizing healthiness benefits or hurts taste perceptions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Institutional investors affected by hurricanes subsequently support environmental proposals in non-affected firms even if they never voted for similar initiatives. Affected investors raise their holdings in firms where their pro-environment votes are consequential. The increased voting support after hurricanes has real effects as environmental proposals endorsed by more hurricane-afflicted investors are more likely to pass. Moreover, both market capitalization and analysts’ recommendations decline after firms pass environmental proposals. Our evidence suggests that natural disasters raise institutional investors’ concerns about the environment and about potential fund flow disruptions. These concerns, in turn, influence environmental activism, corporate policies, and firm performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;People's value of their own time is a key input in public policy evaluations—these evaluations should account for time taken away from work or leisure as a result of policy. Measuring this value for the self-employed is challenging, as, by definition, it is not priced by the market. Using rich choice data collected from farming households in western Kenya, we show that households exhibit non-transitive preferences. As a result, neither market wages nor standard valuation techniques correctly measure participants’ value of time. Using a structural model, we identify the behavioral wedges in participants’ choices, and find that distortions appear when households exchange cash either for time or for goods. Our model estimates suggest that valuing the time of the self-employed at 60% of the market wage is a reasonable rule of thumb.</content>

    <title>Diversification Quotients: Quantifying Diversification via Risk Measures</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We establish the first axiomatic theory for diversification indices using six intuitive axioms: nonnegativity, location invariance, scale invariance, rationality, normalization, and continuity. The unique class of indices satisfying these axioms, called the diversification quotients (DQs), are defined based on a parametric family of risk measures. A further axiom of portfolio convexity pins down DQs based on coherent risk measures. The DQ has many attractive properties, and it can address several theoretical and practical limitations of existing indices. In particular, for the popular risk measures value at risk and expected shortfall, the corresponding DQ admits simple formulas, and it is efficient to optimize in portfolio selection. Moreover, it can properly capture tail heaviness and common shocks, which are neglected by traditional diversification indices. When illustrated with financial data, the DQ is intuitive to interpret, and its performance is competitive against other diversification indices.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: X.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Failure to engage with expertise underpins many organizational and societal problems. Despite decades of research on expertise, we still do not fully understand why such failures persist, and there is a sense that these failures are becoming a crisis of expertise. In this article, we highlight a person's system of beliefs about the meaning of expertise – what we term theirlay theory of expertise(LTE) – as an important factor for understanding their engagement with expertise. Through a free response study (Study 1), analysis of social media data (Study 2), and word sorting study (Study 3), we first develop a taxonomy of common LTE elements. We then examine how LTEs affect expert recognition via two experiments with managers (Studies 4 and 5). Study 4 reveals that congruence between the most psychologically active element of a person's lay theory and expert conduct is conducive to expert recognition, while Study 5 highlights that (in)congruence between LTEs and expert conduct can alter how other mental representations (such as gender stereotypes) shape expert recognition. Our work provides a conceptual foundation for exploring variation in the subjective meaning of expertise in future research on expert recognition and engagement, both within and beyond organizations.</content>

    <title>Corporate Short-Termism: A Review and Research Agenda</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Corporate short-termism, defined as a managerial preference for the short term that undermines a firm’s long-term interests, has become a topic of global concern for governments, investors, and business leaders. In recent years, heightened capital market pressures to maximize shareholder value have intensified focus on the issue, raising concerns that the pursuit of short-term shareholder value may come at the expense of long-term prospects and corporate sustainability. Our review reveals that despite abundant research on short-termism, we have only a fragmented understanding of the factors driving this phenomenon and its consequences. The difficulty of operationalizing the construct and the various firm actions and outcomes examined has hindered consensus as to the specific antecedents and implications of managers’ preference for the short term. Our paper seeks to provide greater clarity on corporate short-termism and to develop a framework for understanding what motivates management to prioritize the short term over the long term and the firm-level consequences of related decisions. In doing so, we hope to advance our state of knowledge on this important issue and motivate scholars to more fully unpack the drivers and outcomes of corporate short-termism.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates how U.S. private firms communicate with investors around private securities offerings. Using multiple research methods including survey, interview, and archival analysis, I provide systematic evidence on private firms' public and private disclosure practices. I find that despite engaging in a low level of public disclosures, private firms actively communicate with investors through private communication channels, with notable variation across firms in terms of content and frequency. Consistent with managers providing relevant information, financial information is disclosed when it is particularly useful for investors' decision‐making. Furthermore, I explore the relation between private communication and public disclosure preferences and find a substitutive effect, suggesting that private firms may strategically manage communication channels to effectively engage with investors. This study contributes to the literature by describing the existing disclosure landscape of private firms.</content>

    <title>CSR as Hedging Against Institutional Transition Risk: Corporate Philanthropy After the Sunflower Movement in Taiwan</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms with political connections to a regime with an authoritarian history face a dilemma when the regime undergoes a democratic transition. Such connections provide an essential competitive advantage when the regime is in power but become a liability when an institutional transition brings democratic change. This study theorizes that when mass protests expose a regime’s distorted policies favoring elites over others and signal a high probability of regime turnover, firms may hedge against the risks associated with their political connections by engaging in philanthropy. We further contend that this effect is stronger for firms located in regions characterized by the rise of an opposing political party or a strong civil society. We find support for our theory in Taiwan’s 2014 Sunflower Movement. Our article reveals a strategy that firms adopt to survive democratic transitions and thus contributes to research on how firms use non-market strategies to adapt to institutional changes. Our research also shows that strategic corporate social responsibility (CSR) can substitute for corporate political activity or compensate for its limitations, and it expands research on the signaling function of social movements from public to private politics.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify phrases associated with novel technologies using textual analysis of patents, job postings, and earnings calls, enabling us to identify four stylized facts on the diffusion of jobs relating to new technologies. First, the development of economically impactful new technologies is geographically highly concentrated, more so even than overall patenting: 56% of the most economically impactful technologies come from just two U.S. locations, Silicon Valley and the Northeast Corridor. Second, as the technologies mature and the number of related jobs grows, hiring spreads geographically. But this process is very slow, taking around 50 years to disperse fully. Third, while initial hiring in new technologies is highly skill biased, over time the mean skill level in new positions declines, drawing in an increasing number of lower-skilled workers. Finally, the geographic spread of hiring is slowest for higher-skilled positions, with the locations where new technologies were pioneered remaining the focus for the technology's high-skill jobs for decades.</content>

    <title>“Optimal” Feedback Use in Crowdsourcing Contests: Source Effect and Priming Intervention</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crowdsourcing contests allow firms to seek ideas from external solvers to address their problems. This research examines solvers’ use of developmental feedback from different sources and of different constructiveness when generating ideas in contests. I theorize a source effect in solvers’ feedback use where they use seeker feedback more than peer feedback, even if both give identical suggestions for their ideas. I also show how the source effect affects solvers’ use of constructive and less constructive feedback from the respective sources. An insight is that compared with their use of peer feedback, solvers’ use of seeker feedback is more extensive at any level of, but less sensitive to, feedback constructiveness. An implication is that solvers may underuse constructive peer feedback and overuse less constructive seeker feedback. Such behaviors can be solver optimal (in terms of improving solvers’ winning prospects) but not seeker optimal (in terms of enhancing ideas for seekers’ problems), as constructive feedback is likely to improve idea quality, whereas less constructive feedback may hurt it. I propose a priming intervention of a feedback evaluation mechanism to mitigate the source effect in solvers’ feedback use—in a way, the intervention can cause solvers to behave more optimally for the seekers. A field survey and three online experiments test the theorizing and proposed intervention. I discuss the contributions and implications of this research for various stakeholders in crowdsourcing contests.Funding: This work was supported by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council [Grant 16502518].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2021.15885 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the impact that social movements have on firm innovation through private politics. We argue that firms strategically respond to private politics by investing in new technologies that address movement-advocated issues material to firms’ performance. Although both contentious private politics—when activists contentiously target firms—and cooperative private politics—when activists and firms collaborate—catalyze innovation, they do so in different ways. Contentious private politics increases the amount of innovation that firms undertake by drawing managerial attention to movement-advocated issues material to the firm, prompting search for solutions to those issues. Conversely, cooperative private politics provides firms access to new knowledge that encourages firms to search for solutions in areas more distant from their existing knowledge and in so doing, increase innovation involving distant recombination on material issues. We find support for our arguments in a matched sample of firms contentiously targeted and with activist collaborations on climate change issues and firms that were not targets of private politics on those issues but had otherwise similar histories of climate-related innovation and relationships with climate movements and other environmental movements. Supplementary analyses corroborate the mechanisms that undergird our theoretical predictions; contentious private politics is associated with more innovation closer to a firm’s expertise, whereas cooperative private politics is associated with innovations that draw on more distant knowledge. We also find that when collaboration follows contention, their respective impacts on innovation are reduced, which may result from firms seeking collaborations for their legitimacy-granting benefits after contention rather than the learning opportunities they offer.Funding: Funding for this research was provided by the Strategic Management Society Strategy Research Foundation [dissertation grant] and Wharton’s Mack Institute for Innovation Management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17497 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how the level of detail in legal regulations impacts crowdfunding. We find that clear, explicit regulations significantly boost crowdfunding volumes in a global sample of digital finance. Using proxies to measure regulatory detail in three types of countries—countries that sometimes, always, or never had regulation—in a series of difference-in-difference regressions, we show a significant positive relation between regulatory clarity and the level of debt crowdfunding. There is little effect on the level of equity crowdfunding. Clear regulations appear to encourage the creation of new crowdfunding platforms rather than concentrating activity in existing ones.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01538 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Variation in functional expertise is an important decision that managers face when designing teams tasked with being creative. We develop theory that predicts that functional diversity has countervailing effects on team creativity through its positive (negative) effect on the uniqueness (usefulness) of the proposals generated. We conduct an experiment where functionally homogeneous or heterogeneous two-person teams are tasked with proposing a creative use for an unused university space. We measure the uniqueness, usefulness, and overall creativity of team proposals. We also use functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging technology to investigate the underlying team cognitive processes. Measured outcomes and fNIRS data support our predictions. Combining conventional experiment and advanced neuroimaging techniques, our study informs theory and practice by providing evidence of how functional diversity affects team creativity.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NA) [Grant 72172132] and CPA Ontario’s Centre for Sustainability Reporting and Performance Management (NA).Supplemental Material: The online supplemental appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02157 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The capability of higher-ability managers to acquire and use resources more efficiently than lower-ability managers suggests a positive linear relation between labor investment efficiency (LIE) and managerial ability (MA). However, a puzzle emerges about how the best managers set themselves apart from their peers, calling into question the linearity of the relation between LIE and MA. We explore this puzzle by asking how the highest-ability managers achieve the highest performance levels. We then investigate this puzzle empirically by considering alternatives to a linear relation between LIE and MA. We begin with the distinction that managers achieve the highest performance when they combine efficient exploitation of existing products and services with successful exploration for innovations in products and services. This point is relevant to our puzzle because a firm’s labor needs for exploration are high and unpredictable. Thus, we expect the highest-ability managers to purposefully invest more than predicted by a model of optimal labor investment across firms. In contrast, we expect low-ability managers, who are less able to evaluate, forecast, and make efficient investments, to deviate more from predicted labor investment and vacillate between over- and underinvestment. We present evidence that supports our predictions of nonlinear relations between LIE and MA, with high-ability managers investing more than predicted and low-ability managers over- and underinvesting. We make and test related hypotheses about exploration (investment in research and development), and we probe further by relating future firm performance to over- and underinvestment in labor for different levels of MA.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the CPA Alberta Education Foundation.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.01932 .</content>

    <title>When Neurodiversity and Ethnicity Combine: Intersectional Stereotyping and Workplace Experiences of Neurodivergent Ethnic Minority Employees</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the workplace experiences of 51 ethnic minority professionals who self‐identify as neurodivergent, focusing specifically on the impact of intersectional stereotyping within organizations in the United Kingdom and United States. Drawing on models of intersectional stereotyping, the research explores how neurodivergent employees' racial or ethnic minority backgrounds influence their self‐perceptions and experiences regarding prevailing stereotypes in professional environments. Semi‐structured interviews reveal that neurodiversity intersects with ethnicity, to either amplify or mitigate prevailing stereotypes during recruitment, performance evaluations, and career progression. Specifically, for Black and Latinx professionals, neurodiversity intensifies pejorative assumptions, reinforcing deficit stereotypes, while for Asian participants, neurodiversity can contradict the “model minority” stereotype. Neurodivergent behaviors are often seen as cultural mismatches with dominant norms, leading individuals to employ identity management strategies for professional advancement. This study extends general HRM diversity and neurodiversity research agendas by elucidating salient intragroup differences at this intersection, expanding intersectional stereotyping literature to include neurodiversity, and underscoring the practical need for integrated organizational inclusion initiatives that address the complex interrelationships between ethnicity and neurodiversity.</content>
