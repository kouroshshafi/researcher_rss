    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research generally suggests that addressing shareholder interests may come at the expense of non‐shareholding stakeholders. Our study challenges this notion by examining how shareholder interests, alongside those of other stakeholders, may align with social issue engagement. Specifically, we explore the relationship between legitimacy challenges (i.e., shareholder activism and social disapproval) and firm strategies in social issue engagement. We find that shareholder activism is positively associated with the materiality of social issue engagement, reflecting a firm's relative emphasis on material social issues over immaterial ones. Conversely, social disapproval is negatively associated with such emphasis. Furthermore, these relationships vary with investor relations officer engagement, the presence of social welfare nonprofits, and SASB standards promulgation. Our findings contribute to the literature on legitimacy management and social issue engagement.Managerial SummaryManaging relationships with both shareholders and non‐shareholding stakeholders is complex amid a diverse landscape of social issues. Firms should be aware of the multifaceted nature of legitimacy challenges and tailor their response strategies accordingly. This study explores the challenges posed by shareholder activism and social disapproval, revealing that shareholder activism is positively related to a firm's relative emphasis on material social issues over immaterial ones, while social disapproval is negatively related to such emphasis. Furthermore, these dynamics are influenced by factors such as investor relations officer engagement, the presence of social welfare nonprofits, and the adoption of SASB standards. The study enhances the understanding of how firms navigate legitimacy challenges and strategically prioritize social issues to meet stakeholder expectations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While extant research has studied extensively the consequences of chief executive officer (CEO) succession, we explore the concept of family CEO mentoring (from a departing family CEO to a younger family leader) as a potential driver of post‐succession performance in family firms. Drawing on stewardship theory and using a data set of 1787 Italian firms experiencing a CEO succession over 14 years, we show that family CEO mentoring positively influences post‐succession financial performance. We then argue and empirically confirm that the performance benefit of family CEO mentoring is enhanced by the presence of nonfamily members on the board but is dampened by industry turbulence. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for research on CEO mentoring, CEO succession, and family business performance.Managerial SummaryTo thrive across generations, family firms need to navigate the many complexities of chief executive officer (CEO) succession. One way to overcome the challenge is to have a departing family leader who provides mentoring to the younger family leader. Our examination of 1787 Italian family firms that experienced CEO succession in the period 2003–2016 suggests that family CEO mentoring drives better post‐succession firm performance, especially when there is a high presence of nonfamily directors in the boardroom and when the firm operates in low‐volatility industries. This study enhances the understanding of CEO succession by integrating the role of family CEO mentoring as a driver of post‐succession financial performance.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Value-Partitioning of Sales Contribution in Business Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In business markets, sales from customers are often jointly determined by multiple roles, yet firms struggle to quantify individual contribution of each role and the synergies among them. This study applies a value-partitioning approach to separate the sales contributions of customer-focused outside (OS) representatives (reps) and operations-focused inside (IS) reps, and their synergistic effects. It leverages variations in OS–IS combinations to generate individual-level value-added metrics, as well as metrics for dyadic synergies. To address empirical challenges such as limited variations in OS–IS combinations, the study employs empirical Bayes estimation, which provides Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) estimates. An application using data from aFortune500 firm operating in business markets, reveals that the value added by OS reps, IS reps, and their interface have substantial and differential impacts on customer sales. Specifically, an increase of one standard deviation in the effect of OS, IS, or interface synergy improves customer sales by 17.8%, 11.6%, or 14.3%, respectively. Simulations demonstrate the superiority of empirical Bayes over fixed effects estimation in reducing bias, and that the value-added metrics are predictive of future customer sales. This research also illustrates how value-added metrics can be applied to evaluate the impact of sales programs on different sales roles.</content>

    <title>Vague Language, Founding Team Human Capital, and Resource Acquisition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Investors look to the language a firm uses for information that may not be available otherwise, especially in entrepreneurial settings. One aspect of language that is garnering greater attention in the management and other business literatures is vagueness. Vague language is often viewed negatively by audiences because of its association with greater uncertainty and potential to obscure negative information. However, some work in linguistics implies that the use of vague language can have positive impacts if the speaker understands the needs of the audience. This study explores the use of vague language and its relationship with investor interest as well as how it interacts with the skills of the entrepreneurial founding team. We hypothesize that, in general, investors are less interested in firms that use vague language, but the positive impacts of vague language become apparent when firm founders have human capital endowments associated with the effective use of language. Analyses based on data from a major start-up pitch competition provide evidence to support these hypotheses. Post hoc analyses explore potential mechanisms.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.16367 .</content>

    <title>Utilities’ Managed Home Charging Programs for Electric Vehicles</title>
    <updated>2025-04-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Experts estimate 20 million electric vehicles will be on U.S. roads by 2030, and the majority (around 80%) of the electric vehicle drivers will use home charging. Many utilities are designing managed home charging programs to centrally manage charging times to reduce cost, avoid new and aggravated peaks and blackouts, and ensure grid stability. These managed home charging programs are either active, in which the utility continuously controls the charging while the vehicle is plugged in, or passive, in which the participants decide when to charge based on preannounced low-rate episodes. We study jointly designing and executing these active and passive programs. We present a program-design model, which produces a menu of the charging programs, tailored for each driver type, and a load-management model, which dynamically manages the load supply to each individual participant. The load-management model consists of a large number of nonhomogeneous participants, and it is a large-scale mixed-integer nonlinear stochastic problem. We present an effective approximation method, conduct thorough theoretical and numerical analyses of our approximation, and provide worst-case bounds for its error components. Our methodology provides detailed insights on the amount and timing of the improvements achievable in cost and demand variability by offering managed home charging programs, and by customizing the passive programs. It also offers detailed insights on the significance of the tradeoff between cost and demand variability. We find promoting a culture of charging electric vehicles every night may significantly increase utilities’ total cost if passive programs have high participation levels.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00850 .</content>

    <title>Assuring the Crowd: The Role of Assurance in Securities Crowdfunding Success</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the role of CPA financial statement assurance in securities crowdfunding. Under SEC Regulation Crowdfunding, effective May 2016, early-stage private companies are permitted to conduct securities crowdfunding offerings—low-dollar securities offerings on Internet platforms—to a large number of investors. Using SEC filings and hand-collected data on the universe of offerings from 2016 to 2019, we examine the relation between CPA assurance and capital raised in the securities crowdfunding market. We fail to find evidence that issuers voluntarily seek higher levels of assurance, and we document high rates of noncompliance with the CPA assurance requirements. Our results suggest the on average positive association between CPA assurance and crowdfunding outcomes shown in prior research is explained by noncompliance with the Reg CF assurance requirements and is not driven by additional assurance. Overall, this study provides new insights of interest to crowdfunding issuers, investors, and regulators on the role of assurance in this nascent market of capital formation for startups.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03178 .</content>

    <title>Lemon Ads: Adverse Selection in Multichannel Display Advertising Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Two auction-based channels play a crucial role in facilitating transactions of ad impressions in display advertising: real-time bidding (RTB), which is accessible to all advertisers, and private marketplace (PMP), which is restricted to a select group of advertisers through invitation-based agreements with publishers. Despite the ongoing discourse on the benefits and drawbacks of these two channels, how their coexistence influences the market dynamics and outcomes remains an open question. In this paper, we investigate this question by focusing on the welfare implications of publishers’ channel adoption. First, using a game-theoretic model, we show that publishers who use both RTB and PMP can leverage their private information on impression quality to sell lower-quality impressions at higher prices in RTB, leading to adverse selection and exposing their RTB-only counterparts to losses. To validate our theoretical prediction, we conduct an empirical analysis using a large proprietary data set. The results provide strong evidence of the presence of adverse selection. In particular, we find that, all else being equal, RTB impressions from dual-channel publishers are of significantly lower quality compared with those from single-channel publishers. Our findings shed light on the nuanced dynamics between RTB and PMP and contribute to the understanding of the complex interplay of informational and strategic factors in the display advertising market.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03407 .</content>

    <title>Learning Mixed Multinomial Logits with Provable Guarantees and Its Applications in Multiproduct Pricing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A mixture of multinomial logits (mixed multinomial logit (MMNL)) generalizes the multinomial logit model, which is commonly used in modeling market demand to capture consumer heterogeneity. Although extensive algorithms have been developed in the literature to learn MMNL models, theoretical results are limited. Built on the Frank-Wolfe (FW) method, we propose a new algorithm that learns both mixture weights and component-specific logit parameters with provable convergence guarantees for an arbitrary number of mixtures. Our algorithm utilizes historical choice data to generate a set of candidate choice probability vectors, each being close to the ground truth with a high probability. We further provide a sample complexity analysis to show that only a polynomial number of samples is required to secure the performance guarantee of our algorithm. Finally, we apply the learned MMNL to data-driven multiproduct pricing problems and quantify how the estimation errors affect the pricing optimality under our proposed data-driven pricing framework Numerical studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>Demographic Diversity and Collusion in Teams</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study optimal workforce and contract design for a firm that employs a team of two agents. The agents have possibly diverse demographic characteristics captured by their discount factors. When both agents have relatively low discount factors (impatient agents), the optimal contract is designed to foster cooperation, whereas when both agents have relatively high discount factors (patient agents), the optimal contract is designed to both foster cooperation and prevent collusion. In preventing collusion, the principal optimally targets the less patient agent by offering him higher-powered incentives, while the more patient agent is offered lower-powered incentives to promote cooperation. Offering high-powered incentives to the less patient agent, who is also less susceptible to collusion, makes it costlier for the more patient agent to bribe the less patient agent into colluding. The optimal workforce is a diverse one consisting of one agent with the highest discount factor and a second agent with a discount factor that is just low enough that both agents can be offered cooperative incentives without inviting collusion. We also study optimal team design for four agents with given discount factors—two with low discount factors and two with high discount factors—who are to be assigned to two teams and identify conditions under which diverse assignment is optimal.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: J.

    <title>EXPRESS: Units or Pounds? How Anchoring on Salient Price Information Influences Perceptions of Product Value</title>
    <updated>2025-04-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research investigates how price format (unit-based, “$1 each” vs. weight-based, “$2 per pound”) affects consumer perceptions of product value. When judging a product’s value, grocery shoppers might consider how much they will have to pay in exchange for how much product (e.g., in pounds) they are getting. This work finds that when making this determination, shoppers anchor on the nominal value (e.g., $1, $2) of the most visually salient price that is displayed to them. As a result of this anchoring bias, perceived value is worse (i.e., less attractive) for lower-weight products (e.g., weighing less than one pound) when the most visually salient price is weight-based rather than unit-based (e.g., for a½ lb. product:$2.00 per pound &lt; $1.00 each). In contrast, for higher-weight products (e.g., weighing more than one pound), weight-based pricing is perceived more favorably than unit-based pricing (e.g., for a2 lb. product:$2.00 per pound &gt; $4.00 each). The authors provide evidence for this price format effect in a series of six studies, including two field studies examining real purchase behavior and sales.</content>

    <title>How Violence Shapes Place: The Rise of Neo‐Authoritarianism in the Global Value Chain and the Emergence of an ‘Infernal Place’ in the Bangladesh Garment Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article examines how and to what extent violence has become a pivotal tool for conducting business in places integrated into the global value chain. It also explores the roles stakeholders play in silencing workers' resistance within these places. Drawing on an in‐depth case study of the Bangladeshi garment industry, this study reveals that both foreign and homegrown violence transform factory floors into infernal places where workers' rights, dignity, emotions, resistance, and even lives are systematically degraded by neo‐authoritarian stakeholders. Furthermore, it explores the ways in which a neo‐authoritarian regime, disguised as promoting economic growth and stability, normalizes violence in these places through constitutional reforms, amendments, or the revocation of legal frameworks. This study contributes to management research by uncovering place‐based violence and the roles of neo‐authoritarian alliances in enabling both organizational and social actors, as gatekeepers, to silence workers' resistance. It argues that without a fundamental shift toward anti‐authoritarian governance, dismantling these infernal places will remain an insurmountable challenge.</content>

    <title>What Makes Mothers Decide (Not) to Become Entrepreneurs? Unpacking the Role of Time and Money in Parental Leave Policies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Whether mothers become entrepreneurs after childbirth may depend on the generosity of the parental leave that they receive. We apply a resource perspective to disentangle the impact of the policy's time and money components on mothers' likelihood of becoming entrepreneurs. Against the common belief that generous parental leave discourages entrepreneurship, we suggest that offering more time and monetary resources through parental leave can promote mothers' entrepreneurship. In a natural experiment (n = 181 mother entrepreneurs from the German Socio‐Economic Panel), we find that a German time‐contractionary policy reform (2001) reduced the odds of mothers becoming self‐employed by 17 per cent. A subsequent money‐expansionary reform (2007) was unrelated to mothers' entrepreneurial entry. Our second study, a conjoint experiment (n = 2176 decisions nested within 136 women), confirms these findings, showing a significant effect for only the time but not the money component of parental leave on women's likelihood of self‐employment. We further explore boundary conditions that underscore nuanced effects of these policies depending on household burdens and socioeconomic context. We conclude that it is the time component of parental leave policies that matters most, while money affects the likelihood of becoming an entrepreneur only among mothers heavily burdened with household responsibilities.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a theory of banking in which banks cannot perfectly control deposit flows. Facing uninsurable loan and deposit shocks, banks dynamically manage lending, wholesale funding, deposits, and equity. Deposits create value by lowering funding costs. However, when the bank is undercapitalized and at risk of breaching leverage requirements, the marginal value of deposits can turn negative as deposit inflows, by raising leverage, increase the likelihood of costly equity issuance. Banks' inability to fully control leverage distinguishes them from nondepository intermediaries. Our model suggests a reevaluation of leverage regulations and offers new perspectives on banking in a low‐interest‐rate environment.</content>

    <title>Customizing your way to health: How self‐customization influences food choices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Companies are increasingly adopting self‐customization, allowing customers to create personalized products. In the food and beverage industry, this is often provided at no extra cost. While most consumers believe that adding more options maximizes the benefit in self‐customization, which leads companies to adopt pay‐per‐add pricing models to manage costs, this logic does not always hold in food consumption. In this context, adding more can compromise health goals and diminish the taste experience. Across a field study conducted with a pizza restaurant that temporarily switched from a fixed à‐la‐carte menu to a self‐customization menu and two controlled experiments, we demonstrate that self‐customization in indulgent contexts leads to healthier choices—pizzas with fewer calories and fat calories—by enhancing a sense of autonomy. We further identify a boundary condition, where the positive effect of self‐customization diminishes in healthy contexts, such as when choosing a salad.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Due to their limited reputation as potential employers, startups struggle to generate interest (e.g., applications) from jobseekers. To help mitigate these frictions, employers can proactively reach out to jobseekers. In this study, we examine the relationship between firm‐driven search and startups' hiring and retention of young workers. Using a unique empirical setting, we find that firm‐driven search is associated with a higher likelihood of hiring. However, candidates sourced through firm‐driven search exhibit greater turnover rates. In exploring the underlying mechanisms, we find suggestive evidence that candidates perceive firm‐driven search as a favored substitute for their search efforts. For employers, startups with lower visibility and pronounced hiring needs are most likely to engage in firm‐driven search, implying that they do so despite the lower retention prospects.Managerial SummaryStartups often struggle to attract applicants due to limited visibility and reputation. This study examines “firm‐driven search,” where startups initiate contact with candidates, using data from Venture for America. We find that this proactive approach improves hiring outcomes but increases employee turnover. Why? Candidates are more likely to consider and accept inbound opportunities, which can result in weaker alignment with their interests or goals. Despite the retention risk, startups with urgent hiring needs or limited reputation often adopt this strategy because the immediate benefits outweigh the costs. The takeaway: firm‐driven search is a powerful but double‐edged tool. It helps less‐visible startups compete for talent—but may lead to higher churn. Founders should balance the short‐term gains in hiring against the long‐term costs of employee turnover.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects of going public using a unique panel of firms in 16 European countries for which we observe financial data before and after initial public offering (IPO) attempts. We compare completed and withdrawn IPO attempts. We instrument the decision to complete the IPO using prior market returns. After instrumenting, we isolate a positive causal effect of going public on profitability. We also find a post-IPO expansion in sales per employee, subsidiaries, and countries in which firms operate. Overall, our results are consistent with going public relaxing financial constraints and inducing a shift in strategy towards increased commercialization. (JEL G32)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper shows that high-skilled immigrants strategically increase their workplace efforts in response to identity-based career concerns that intensify following national conflicts between their countries of origin and host countries. Leveraging the rapid escalation of the U.S.–China conflict following the 2016 U.S. presidential election in the difference-in-differences framework, we show that Chinese-descent inventors in the United States significantly increased their workplace efforts compared with their Korean- and Japanese-descent counterparts. Consistent with our theory, this effect is more pronounced among Chinese-descent inventors more vulnerable to identity-based career concerns, including midcareer migrants, those with ethnically distinctive first names, corporate inventors more dependent on immigration sponsorship than academic counterparts, and those residing in counties with higher levels of Trump support. Furthermore, using a nationally representative survey, we find that Chinese-descent college-educated workers in the United States reported working significantly more hours than their Korean and Japanese counterparts following the conflict. This study contributes to our understanding of how high-skilled immigrants adjust their workplace efforts in response to geopolitical tensions.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.19031 .</content>

    <title>Big Shoes to Fill: How Star Search Behavior and Network Structure Influence Coinventor Mobility and Innovation Performance upon Star Exit</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A robust body of literature examines how star inventors influence their firms’ innovation trajectories, but how their departure affects firm innovation outcomes is imprecisely understood. Star departure has two kinds of spillover effects on firms: increased coinventor mobility and reduced coinventor performance. In this study, we aim to understand whether and why these spillover effects may systematically differ between stars. We argue that star search behavior influences the nature of embeddedness—positional and structural—in the star-coinventor network, which in turn differentially affects the two spillover effects arising from star exit. We test our hypotheses using patent data from 1985 to 2010 in the pharmaceutical industry. We find that when compared with the exit of an average star inventor, the exit of a broad-searcher star inventor is associated with a greater reduction in coinventor performance but not in coinventor mobility. In contrast, the exit of a deep-searcher star inventor is associated with an increase in coinventor mobility but has a smaller effect in reducing (remaining) coinventor performance than the departure of a broad-searcher star. We find that variation in the star’s collaboration network structure underlies these effects. Further, network structure has countervailing effects on coinventors’ mobility and (remaining) coinventors’ performance. This study helps better understand the human capital versus relational capital effects of inventor mobility.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2020.14415 .</content>

    <title>Meating Expectations: Category Legitimation and Transmutation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how market actors legitimize new categories that challenge the foundational understandings of established ones while simultaneously seeking to compete in the same market space. We analyze the development of the U.S. plant-based meat category from 2012 to 2019, focusing on how plant-based meat producers positioned their products as legitimate competitors within the meat category despite their nonanimal origins. We identify three key legitimation strategies used by entrepreneurs: reconfiguring the category basis by reframing the core attributes of meat from animal origin to shared biochemical components; creating experiential congruence by replicating the sensory qualities and social practices associated with traditional meat; and instilling value superiority by emphasizing health, environmental, and ethical benefits along with forward-thinking innovation. Our observations also lead us to theorize what we term category transmutation—a construct for understanding how the successful legitimation of a new category might reshape the meaning and boundaries of an existing one. We envision category transmutation as a process through which an existing category evolves to incorporate both traditional and new subcategories, thereby vertically modifying the category structure. This study advances our understanding of category dynamics and extends the role of cultural entrepreneurship beyond gaining legitimacy to reshaping category systems and market structures, with the potential to drive positive societal changes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study mixed-integer programming formulations for the piecewise linear lower and upper bounds (in other words, piecewise linear relaxations) of nonlinear functions that can be modeled by a new class of combinatorial disjunctive constraints (CDCs), generalized nD-ordered CDCs. We first introduce a general formulation technique to model piecewise linear lower and upper bounds of univariate nonlinear functions concurrently so that it uses fewer binary variables than modeling bounds separately. Next, we propose logarithmically sized ideal nonextended formulations to model the piecewise linear relaxations of univariate and higher-dimensional nonlinear functions under the CDC and independent branching frameworks. We also perform computational experiments for the approaches modeling the piecewise linear relaxations of nonlinear functions and show significant speed-ups of our proposed formulations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that piecewise linear relaxations can provide strong dual bounds of the original problems with less computational time by an order of magnitude.Funding: This work was supported by the Office of Naval Research [Grant N000142412648], for Rice University.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2023.0187 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Professions continue to be central to understanding organizing in the 21st century. The literature on professions is segmented into theoretical conversations that offer different conceptualizations of professions and theoretical concerns. Through an analysis of the literature, we unpack four lanes – teleological, institutional, ecological, and cultural – that co‐exist to make up the literature on professions. We synthesize the theoretical conversations generated within each lane, identify key distinctions across lanes, and assess the future potential of each lane, noting where there is space for contribution. Beyond making the dominant paradigms, their plurality, and their central distinctions recognizable, we encourage researchers to move beyond studying professionsquaprofessions to articulate the role and impact of professions in organizations and society. We offer seven proposals for enlivening the research agenda on professions, including prioritizing real‐world problems and outcomes over paradigmatic perspectives.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crowdfunding is a relatively nascent, rapidly growing phenomenon whereby individuals or ventures pursue funding from a potentially large number of backers via the Internet. This rapidly emerging literature invites a variety of conceptual lenses and offers significant potential to advance theoretical understanding of important organizational activities, such as how entrepreneurs and organizations are evaluated by external stakeholders or how the crowdfunding process shapes the strategic decisions of emerging organizations. Our integrative review seeks to discover how the extant body of crowdfunding research challenges, extends, and contributes to the theoretical understanding of management and organizational phenomena and how these insights might drive further theoretical advancement. To do so, we inductively identify ten dominant topics that span the crowdfunding landscape across disciplines (268 articles) and synthesize the major findings within each topic based on relevant theoretical concepts. In doing so, we highlight how each topic area has applied and advanced various organizational theories. We then leverage the ten topics to articulate opportunities for future research uncovered by our review that provide potential contributions to theories germane to the management literature and to guide the next decade of crowdfunding research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the primary article of this research dialogue (Journal of Consumer Psychology, 2025), we outlined the social, cognitive, and affective benefits of interacting with nature and briefly discussed the relevance of this work to consumer psychology. In their commentary to our primary article, Haws and Yamim approached nature purely within the marketplace setting and discussed how consumer exposure to natural elements may activate semantic networks that will predictably influence consumer behavior. We contextualized the current response to this commentary under the umbrella of sustainability and sustainable consumer decisions. First, we clarify attention restoration theory, stress reduction theory, and assumptions regarding the preference for nature. Second, we discuss definitions of nature from an interdisciplinary perspective. Building upon this, we speak to the potential semantic activations suggested by Haws and Yamim in response to nature exposure, probing potential individual and group‐level variations and the relevance of these differences in the consumer space. Finally, we discuss potential conflicts of utilizing nature in the marketplace embedded within the perspective of sustainability goals. In this sense, we question the consequences and ethical considerations of employing nature as a mechanism to influence consumer behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Rim, Schertz, and Berman (Journal of Consumer Psychology, 2025) present prior research examining the affective, cognitive, and social benefits of humans' interactions with nature. In doing so, they offer some specific applications to consumer psychology and encourage more research examining the consequences of nature interaction on consumer behaviors. We build on this important work by considering the breadth of potential forms of interaction between consumers and nature in both indoor and outdoor spaces as well as in real and virtual (i.e., representations of) nature exposures. We build on semantic activation and goal‐systems theory to elaborate further on how nature can influence consumers. Specifically, associations elicited by nature can activate or enhance the importance of certain goals during the consumption process, thus driving consumers' judgments and decision‐making. We elaborate on how nature can be specifically applied to the place, product, and promotion elements of the marketing mix and how future research can examine the consequences of nature interactions on consumer behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The surrounding environment influences how people feel, think, and behave. This effect is apparent when examining the multitude of ways interactions with natural environments impact people psychologically. In this Research Dialogue, we discuss work by ourselves and others that demonstrate the benefits of spending time in nature or interacting with natural stimuli, across three psychological domains. First, we discuss affective benefits, such as improved mood and decreased stress and rumination. Then, we discuss cognitive benefits, such as improved working memory. Lastly, we discuss social benefits, such as prosocial and proenvironmental attitudes. We introduce several environmental psychology theories that try to explain why these benefits occur. We present our own work that attempts to determine what characteristics of natural environments cause or are related to these effects by quantifying distinguishing characteristics of natural versus built environments along a variety of dimensions. We then investigate how these dimensions influence the psychological experience in a more natural versus a more built environment. We end by outlining the implications of the benefits of interacting with nature in influencing consumer behaviors.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can algorithms help people detect deception in high-stakes strategic interactions? Participants watching the preplay communication of contestants in the TV show Golden Balls display a limited ability to predict contestants’ behavior, whereas algorithms do significantly better. To increase participants’ accuracy, we provide them with algorithmic advice by flagging videos for which an algorithm predicts a high likelihood of cooperation or defection. We test how the effectiveness of flags depends on their timing. We show that participants rely significantly more on flags shown before they watch the videos than flags shown after they watch them. These findings show that the timing of algorithmic feedback is key for its adoption.This paper was accepted by Marie-Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: Funding provided by an Innovation Grant for Inclusive Research Excellence at UC San Diego.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02792 .</content>

    <title>Employee Mobility Barriers: An Integrative Review Across Careers, Human Resources, and Strategic Management Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The ability of employees to move between firms of their own volition is a defining characteristic that distinguishes human capital from other resources. This review bridges previously isolated research communities by synthesizing knowledge on “employee mobility barriers”—mechanisms that restrict employee movement and help firms maintain human capital-based competitive advantages. We introduce a typology of ten categories of employee mobility barriers, differentiated by level of analysis (individual, organizational, societal) and degree of firm control, to organize the disparate literature on this topic. Building on this foundation, we propose an architecture of strategic modes that characterizes firm responses to employee mobility barriers based on the level of firm control (high vs. low) and the level at which barriers operate (individual vs. organizational). This framework offers a theoretical lens for understanding how firms navigate these barriers through proactive and reactive strategies, highlighting implications for decision-making, centralization, and delegation. Our review examines the dual nature of employee mobility as both an opportunity and a challenge for firms and individuals, with implications across three primary domains: individual careers, human capital/human resource management (HC/HRM), and strategic management. We propose a portfolio perspective for future research to explore whether different mobility barriers act as complements or substitutes. Additionally, we consider the relational benefits of employee mobility and suggest directions for further inquiry. By integrating our typology and the architecture of strategic modes, this review advances theoretical and practical understanding of employee mobility barriers, reflecting recent developments and setting the stage for future research.</content>

First, consistent with a positive volume-volatility relation, stock price volatility amplifies on recurring ad days. Second, informed investors time liquidity to trade more aggressively on recurring ad days. Third, despite the increase in informed trading on such days, price impact is lower, yielding a negative volume–price impact relation. Collectively, the evidence supports the theoretical predictions of Collin-Dufresne and Fos (2016).</content>

    <title>How to Sustain Sustainable Practices? The Journey Toward Zero Waste Lifestyle</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sustaining sustainable practices in a market whose infrastructure continues to prioritize unsustainable options is not easy. It is even more difficult when living sustainably involves interwoven practices that are embedded and connected together. We focus on one such system of sustainable practices and explore consumers’ journey toward Zero Waste lifestyle, a system of practices not yet institutionalized. Using a qualitative multimethod study and a practice theoretical lens, this research uncovers the iterative process through which this system of practices develops around the Zero Waste meta-meaning, a driving force common to all practices. Our analyses reveal a set of adaptive capabilities that allow carriers of practices to gradually grow and stabilize the system of interwoven practices that scaffold the Zero Waste lifestyle. The institutionalization of the system of practices requires a mutualization of capabilities amongst carriers who hold a common meta-meaning. This mutually reinforcing process and reciprocity enables the gradual institutionalization of the system of practices. By approaching the maintenance of sustainable practices with a practice theoretical lens, this research offers new ways to encourage and promote the transition toward more sustainable lifestyles.</content>

    <title>Haptic Rewards: How Mobile Vibrations Shape Reward Response and Consumer Choice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;People spend a large portion of their day interacting with vibrating mobile devices, yet how consumers psychologically respond to haptic feedback from these devices and their effect on consumer decision-making is largely unknown. Integrating recent work on human–computer interaction and reward processing, the current research examines: (1) the relationship between vibration duration and reward response, (2) to what extent rewarding vibrations influence consumer choice, (3) the process by which this effect occurs, and (4) how the effect differs compared to other forms of feedback (visual and audio). We find that mobile vibrations evoke a reward response that is distinct from other forms of feedback, which in turn boosts purchasing in online shopping environments (increased item adds and higher basket totals), and that impulsive consumers tend to be more responsive to mobile vibrations. We examine the impact of mobile vibrations on consumer decision-making in a variety of experimental settings, drawing on a diverse participant pool, leveraging both controlled experiments, and a country-wide field experiment to assess important boundary conditions. These findings have important implications for the ethical design of haptic interfaces in the marketplace and the role of mobile vibrations as a novel form of reward.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper examines the decision‐making, compensation, and turnover of female CEOs in U.S. hospitals. Contrary to the literature on lower‐ranked executives and directors in public firms, there is no evidence that gender differences in preferences for risk or altruism affect decision‐making of hospital CEOs: corporate policies do not shift when women take (or leave) office, and male and female CEOs respond similarly to a major financial shock. However, female CEOs earn lower salaries, face flatter pay‐for‐performance incentives, and exhibit greater turnover after poor performance.

    <title>The Color of Status: Color Saturation, Brand Heritage, and Perceived Status of Luxury Brands</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The elevation of brand status is a crucial goal for numerous luxury brands. Building on the framework of learned color associations, the current research suggests that using less saturated colors in products enhances consumers’ perception of luxury brand status. This effect arises from consumers’ association between less saturated colors and the passage of time, leading to perceptions of the brand as having a rich continuity heritage. Because continuity heritage confers a higher status on a luxury brand, consumers subsequently perceive the brand as having elevated status. Through seven experimental and field studies, we empirically demonstrate that low (vs. high) color saturation increases a luxury brand’s perceived brand status, with perceived continuity heritage mediating this effect. However, this effect is mitigated when the brand highlights its recent (vs. old) foundation years and is even reversed when the brand positions itself as innovative. Additionally, we show that color saturation can affect consumers’ willingness to pay and product choices. This work contributes to the literature on luxury branding, brand heritage, and color while offering valuable insights for luxury brand managers on effectively enhancing their brand’s perceived status.</content>

    <title>Does Using a Pink Product Increase Men’s Support for Women? How Product Usage Influences Perspective-Taking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Integrating insights from several different theoretical perspectives, this research formulates and tests a conceptualization of how men’s use of products containing features stereotypically associated with women (e.g., pink-colored products) induces them to become more supportive of women. This effect is held to arise because men’s use of pink products leads them to have an experience similar to the one associated with women, encouraging male users to adopt the perspective of women. In turn, this perspective-taking increases their willingness to engage in behaviors supportive of women. Across six studies, we found that when men used pink-colored products (e.g., pens, headphones, folders), they subsequently showed greater support for women, such as writing supportive messages, sharing information about gender equality, donating money, and volunteering. However, this effect diminished when men merely saw the pink products rather than used them, when their gender identity was threatened, or when the support target was not women. We also discussed the implications of these findings.</content>

    <title>A Meta‐Analysis of Employee &lt;scp&gt;HR&lt;/scp&gt; Attributions and Their Relationships With Employee‐Perceived High‐Performance Work Systems and Employee Outcomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on HR attributions has received a considerable amount of attention in the study of employee perceptions of human resource management (HRM). This increased attention is based on the premise that employee attributions aboutwhycertain HR practices are implemented significantly influence employee outcomes. In this study, we review and meta‐analytically examine the relationships between two major types of HR attributions (i.e., commitment‐ and control‐focused) and various employee outcomes (i.e., employee vitality and engagement, work attitudes, and job performance). We also test several boundary conditions (e.g., the target of HR attributions) that may influence these relationships using multi‐level meta‐regression analysis. In addition, we meta‐analytically examine the relationships between two major HR attributions and their key antecedent—employee‐perceived high‐performance work systems (HPWS). Using the meta‐analytic data, we perform a path analysis to test a theory‐driven model that links employee‐perceived HPWS to commitment‐focused and control‐focused HR attributions and, ultimately, employee outcomes. We then conduct a general dominance analysis to compare the relative importance of employee‐perceived HPWS and the two types of HR attributions. As a supplementary analysis, we meta‐analyze the impact of demographic variables in shaping commitment‐ and control‐focused HR attributions. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and empirical implications of our findings, along with future research directions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document political sentiment effects on U.S. inventors. Democratic inventors are more likely to patent (relative to Republicans) after the 2008 election of Obama but less likely after the 2016 election of Trump. These effects are at least twice as strong among politically active Democrats and are present even within firms and within firm×technology. We also show that partisans tend to cluster in technologies (e.g., Democrats in Biotechnology and Republicans in Weapons), so that sentiment effects aggregate to more patents in the technologies dominated by the winning party.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study collusion among firms against imperfectly monitored environmental regulation. Firms increase variable profits by violating regulation and reduce expected noncompliance penalties by violating jointly. We consider a case of three German automakers colluding to reduce the effectiveness of emissions control technology. By estimating a structural model of the European automobile industry from 2007 to 2018, we find that collusion lowers expected noncompliance penalties substantially and increases buyer and producer surplus. Due to increased pollution, welfare decreases by € 1.57–5.57 billion. We show how environmental policy design and antitrust play complementary roles in preventing noncompliance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this IssueHow to allocate limited resources when people compete for them?Data-driven decision rules are increasingly used to allocate limited resources. However, in domains such as college admissions and job hiring, these policies can be gamed and may perform poorly when people can strategically change their behavior and compete for the resource. Given a fixed selection criterion for scoring individuals, competition causes the threshold for receiving the resource to oscillate and change over time. As a concrete example, the median SAT score of an accepted student at a university can evolve over time because of competition. In “Policy Learning with Competing Agents,” Stanford researchers Roshni Sahoo and Stefan Wager demonstrate that this process can stabilize and reach an equilibrium. They develop an algorithm based on a local experimentation scheme to learn data-driven decision rules that maximize social welfare in the presence of competition.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using gender to identify analyst groups, we examine whether in-group bias affects the behavior of sell-side equity analysts and the information dissemination process. We find that analysts hold more optimistic and less accurate earnings expectations for firms with same-gender CEOs, where in-group bias is stronger among men. Greater exposure to out-of-group individuals weakens in-group bias, and the bias is also weaker among analysts located in U.S. states with greater gender equality. Group definitions based on race/ethnicity and name similarity yield similar results. These findings are robust and unlikely to reflect selective information access or various selection effects.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01467 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Lending relationships matter for firm financing. In a model of debt dynamics, we study how lending relationships are formed and how they impact the joint choice of leverage and debt maturity, thereby rationalizing recent empirical findings and generating new predictions. In the model, lending relationships evolve through repeated interactions between firms and debt investors. Stronger lending relationships lead firms to adopt higher leverage ratios, issue longer term debt, and raise funds from nonrelationship lenders via syndicated loans or bonds issues when relationship quality is sufficiently high. Debt contracts involving nonrelationship investors have longer maturity than those exclusively issued to relationship investors.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the Swiss Finance Institute, the Danish Finance Institute, and the Center for Financial Frictions [Grant DNRF102].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02415 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a controlled laboratory experiment, we examine how financial reporting regulations—limits on earnings management and auditing—affect disclosure quality and market efficiency. Our findings indicate that a tight limit and the possibility of an audit enhance the informativeness of earnings disclosures, leading to improved pricing efficiency while a weak limit deteriorates disclosure quality and pricing efficiency. Financial reporting regulations enhance disclosure quality via both constraining earnings management practices and inducing signaling behavior. Auditing more effectively boosts social welfare by suppressing manipulation, whereas limits trigger overinvestment in costly signal. Our results also shed light on previously contradictory empirical findings regarding financial reporting regulations.This paper was accepted by Marie Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: Y.

    <title>Behind Emerging Market Firms’ Internationalization, Diversification, and Innovation: A Geographic Relational Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The internationalization of emerging market firms (EMFs) has attracted substantial research attention. Yet, how EMFs engage in diversification and innovation during internationalization remains underexplored. Drawing insights from a geographic relational perspective, we perform a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) on a sample of EMFs. Our findings suggest that EMFs can choose from multiple equifinal internationalization pathways to capture growth opportunities in diversification and/or innovation. These new insights emphasize that achieving diversification or innovation requires a combination of organizational contextuality, international path dependence, and geographic practice attributes. We further develop a taxonomy of five EMFs’ geographic relational configurations for diversification and/or innovation: entrenching specialist, niche explorer, global adapter, transnational agent, and strategic aspirant. Overall, by unleashing the power of configurational analysis, this paper reveals what is behind the intriguing internationalization of EMFs with a focus on diversification and innovation.</content>

    <title>Mitigating ingroup bias in regulatory firms: The role of inspector professionalism</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article adopts the lens of ingroup bias to study why regulatory firms tasked with enforcing regulatory compliance may underperform in their duties. We theorize that ingroup bias can lead regulatory agents to grant unwarranted trust to ingroup clients with whom they share salient characteristics, resulting in less stringent inspections for these clients compared to outgroup clients. We further examine how this effect is moderated by inspectors' professionalism, a human capital dimension reflecting an individual's engagement with their profession and internalization of its norms and standards. Using a difference‐in‐differences approach on micro‐data tracking 86 inspectors across 24,650 inspections of 462 vessels at a marine inspection firm, we find compelling evidence of ingroup bias and show that inspectors' professionalism mitigates its impact on regulatory enforcement stringency.</content>

    <title>Measuring Misreporting Incentives and Severity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose an empirical measure of the types of financial misreporting based on misreporting incentives. We identify three distinct types: (1) misreporting driven by top executives’ wealth pursuits, (2) misreporting induced by capital market pressure, and (3) misreporting by subordinates due to inadequate management oversight. Our measure is developed by conducting a detailed analysis of the textual data from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases. We also provide rigorous empirical validations. Additionally, we create a composite misreporting severity score that incorporates the three misreporting incentives. Using our measure of misreporting incentives, we help reconcile previous mixed findings on the link between equity incentives and financial misreporting. Furthermore, in predicting market reactions to misreporting, our misreporting severity score outperforms a measurement that does not integrate misreporting incentives. Our measures can be practical tools for investigating a wide range of research questions related to the causes and consequences of financial misreporting.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1 [Grants RG101/22 and RG59/17].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00160 .</content>

    <title>From the Boardroom to the Jobsite: Female Board Representation and Workplace Safety</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Contributing to emerging research on corporate governance and operations management, our study examines the connection between board diversity and workplace safety. We propose that boards with a higher representation of female directors prioritize and thus enhance workplace safety due to women's distinct social‐cognitive perspectives on stakeholders, risk avoidance, and regulatory compliance. We also consider two conditions that may strengthen the relationship between female board representation and workplace safety: (1) the power of the female directors on the board, which may cause them to speak out more, and cause others to heed their perspectives; (2) accountability pressures faced by the board, which may increase board member epistemological motivation (the willingness to invest effort to fully understand the board's tasks and decisions being made). Analyzing a unique dataset that covers 1442 firm‐year observations across 266 firms, we show that female board representation improves workplace safety when women have more power and when boards face greater accountability pressures. In an empirical extension, we examine how the representation of racial/ethnic minority directors impacts workplace safety and the synergistic effect of female and minority board representation. Our findings deepen our understanding of how board diversity interacts with situational factors to influence operational outcomes.</content>

    <title>Contending with Perceived Legitimacy Tensions: Impact Investing in Pluralistic Institutional Environments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study advances our understanding of new venture legitimacy and resource acquisition by broadening the epistemological scope of our theory to be inclusive of non‐Western contexts. We conducted a qualitative study of entrepreneurs from India, Kenya, and Mexico seeking impact investments from Western impact investors to better understand how entrepreneurs in non‐Western contexts contend with perceived legitimacy tensions that arise when pursuing financial resources from non‐local investors. In contrast to the prevailing assumption that non‐Western entrepreneurs are resource‐constrained and adhere to existing strategies to seek legitimacy from financial resource providers, we find that such entrepreneurs perceive their local institutional environment to have important non‐financial resources that impact how they seek legitimacy from financial resource providers. This study offers a novel conceptualization of new venture legitimation by acknowledging non‐Western and Western institutional environments as important considerations in how entrepreneurs navigate legitimacy with both financial and non‐financial audiences over time.</content>

    <title>International contraction for the sake of international expansion</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present novel theoretical arguments suggesting that the contraction of international market presence does not only allow firms to expand their presence into new business domains, but also to resume their international market presence in the long term. We argue that when firms contract their international market presence, they spark two subsequent processes: First, they free up non‐scale free financial resources that become available for expanding into new business domains. Subsequently, such expansion creates new scale free technological knowledge resources that facilitate renewed international expansion. We find support for the existence of this novel growth trajectory in an analysis of changes in the international market presence and business segment presence of an extensive sample of public US‐based firms between 1997 and 2019.Managerial SummaryPolitical frictions, economic crises, and pandemics in the wake of the 21st century have led to volatility in the international presence of firms. In this article, we argue and show that firms that contract their international market presence can use scarce financial resources that are freed up due to such contraction to expand their business scope. In turn, business scope expansion allows these firms to create new technological knowledge resources that support resumed international expansion. Generalizing this phenomenon, we argue that, in an age where firms need to navigate international contraction and expansion, contracting international presence in the short term does not only allow the expansion of business domains but also supports the expansion of international presence in the long term. Studying an extensive sample of public US‐based firms between 1997 and 2019 lends support to this view.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Because invention activities involve accessing, identifying, and recombining relevant prior art, startups confront significant search cost and effort. Using Google Patents's 2006 digitization of inventive records as a natural experiment, we examine how digitization affects the directionality and nature of entrepreneurial innovation. We analyze 17,664 US‐based startups in the life sciences industry and find that digitization increases the quantity and quality of prior art used as innovation inputs and those of patent applications generated as innovation outputs. Moreover, our findings indicate that digitization enables startups to transcend local searches for relevant inputs and increase both their entry into new technological domains and output utility. Our study sheds new light on how digitization and its search functionalities reshape startup innovation in the digital era.Managerial SummaryGoogle Patents's 2006 digitization of inventive records transformed entrepreneurial innovation in the US Analyzing 17,664 life sciences startups, we find that digitization enhances search efficiency by alleviating constraints in accessing knowledge while boosting search effectiveness by improving inventive experimentation as online search features make identifying and utilizing relevant external knowledge timelier and more precise. Digitization enables startups to utilize greater volume, higher quality, and more diverse knowledge from prior art while also reinforcing invention outcomes, expanding into new technological domains, and generating more impactful inventions. This study highlights how digitization democratizes access to knowledge and improves search effectiveness and entrepreneurial experimentation, ultimately transforming the startup innovation landscape. Overall, digitization disproportionately benefits startups in areas geographically remote from physical knowledge repositories.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Access to markets is critical for entrepreneurial success, yet many face significant barriers. This study argues that digital platforms functioning as peer‐to‐peer marketplaces can facilitate entrepreneurial activity by improving market access for new ventures. Using the staggered entry of Craigslist into various markets, we find that Craigslist's entry increased local entrepreneurial activities, especially in low‐income regions. Moreover, individuals from lower‐income households, as well as Black and immigrant communities, were more likely to create new ventures following Craigslist's entry. Firms founded after Craigslist's entry were also smaller in size, potentially reflecting more efficient management, and primarily operated in B2C rather than B2B sectors. This study highlights how multisided platforms can empower individuals with limited market access and resources, ultimately democratizing entrepreneurship in the digital age.Managerial SummaryAccess to markets is essential for entrepreneurs to succeed, yet many face significant challenges in starting and growing their businesses. This study demonstrates how digital platforms like Craigslist can help overcome these barriers and create opportunities for more people to participate in entrepreneurship. When Craigslist expanded to new locations, it increased small business activity, particularly in low‐income areas. Individuals from lower‐income households, as well as Black and immigrant communities, were especially likely to benefit from it when starting businesses. These businesses were smaller in size, potentially indicating more efficient management and more B2C‐focused operations. This research underscores how digital platforms can make markets more accessible for traditionally disadvantaged groups, fostering a more inclusive entrepreneurial ecosystem.</content>

    <title>Political Districting to Optimize the Polsby-Popper Compactness Score with Application to Voting Rights</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When drawing political districts, important criteria include district compactness and the ability of minority groups to convert votes into seats. In litigation, compactness is usually measured via the Polsby-Popper score; however, this score has largely been absent from the operations research literature, presumably because of its nonlinear nature. In “Political Districting to Optimize the Polsby-Popper Compactness Score with Application to Voting Rights,” Belotti, Buchanan, and Ezazipour propose new mixed-integer second-order cone programs (MISOCPs) to optimize this score, enabling them to find optimally compact districts built from voting precincts. The methods are extended to find compact plans with many majority-minority districts. This is the task faced by plaintiffs in lawsuits brought under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 who must show that an alternative plan exists in which the minority group could achieve better representation. Computational experiments show that the MISCOP-based methods perform as well (or better) than state-of-the-art approaches for this task, scaling to instances with nearly 200,000 census blocks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How Online Retailers Can Fulfill Orders Faster and Cheaper in Structured RDC–FDC NetworksThe global surge in online shopping has driven e-retailers to rapidly expand their warehouse networks for faster deliveries. However, this has significantly increased fulfillment costs. In the paper “Multi-item Online Order Fulfillment in a Two-Layer Network,” Zhao, Wang, and Xin explore efficient ways to reduce these costs by examining how orders are allocated among warehouses in real time. They analyze a simple “myopic” algorithm, where each order is assigned immediately to the cheapest available warehouse without considering future orders. Surprisingly, this straightforward algorithm proves effective in structured warehouse networks consisting of larger regional distribution centers (RDCs) and smaller front distribution centers (FDCs), like those operated by JD.com . This contrasts sharply with more flexible fulfillment networks such as Amazon’s, where myopic algorithms usually underperform because of more complex fulfillment options requiring more advanced real-time algorithms. The key takeaway for businesses facing uncertain demand is that a less flexible fulfillment network—such as one consisting of large RDCs and smaller FDCs—enables simple and effective allocation methods.</content>

    <title>Robustly Optimal Contracts for Agricultural Supply Chains</title>
    <updated>2025-04-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Because of various factors (such as a lack of adequate statistical knowledge or data, unforeseen weather events), the yields of agricultural products often exhibit a high level of ambiguity. When facing distributional ambiguity in yields, farmers and landowners may base their contracting decisions on descriptive statistics, such as the mean and variance. To investigate how limited information could reshape optimal contract forms, we consider an agricultural supply chain in which a landowner contributes farmland and a skilled farmer exerts costly private effort to cultivate a crop. Both parties face distributional ambiguity in crop yield and employ a robust max-min decision rule. When the landowner possesses the bargaining power to draft the contract (the L model), we find that a hybrid contract of debt and equity is robustly optimal. In contrast, when the farmer possesses the bargaining power (the F model), the optimal contract could be a linear (equity) contract or a nonlinear quadratic debt contract, depending on the coefficient of variation (CV) and the landowner’s reservation profit. We use U.S. Department of Agriculture data to calibrate the model and find that, as the CV increases, the party that possesses the bargaining power tends to share more risk. We also find that when both the CV and the landowner’s reservation profit are sufficiently large, the L model induces a higher effort level; otherwise, the F model achieves better effort. Finally, we extend the model to consider various features, such as random crop price, farmer’s risk aversion and bounded crop yield.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: G.

    <title>Reshaping Corporate Boards Through Mandatory Gender Diversity Disclosures: Evidence from Canada</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study whether and how standardized gender diversity disclosure requirements affect women’s representation on corporate boards. Our analysis takes advantage of Canada’s 2014 regulation, which requires disclosures of consistent and comparable information on boards’ gender diversity policies and guidelines. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the disclosure regulation increases women’s representation on boards. The increase is more pronounced among firms with stronger shareholder oversight as proxied by ownership from environmental, social, and governance (ESG)–friendly investors, poor diversity performance preregulation, Toronto Stock Exchange index membership, and U.S. cross-listing. In addition, after the regulation, firms that make stronger diversity commitments (e.g., disclosing the adoption of written diversity policies and diversity targets) experience a higher increase in ownership by foreign ESG-friendly investors. Together, our findings suggest that standardized disclosure requirements enable shareholders to be better monitors, thereby improving board gender balance.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00509 .</content>

    <title>Insufficient Effort Responding in Management Research: A Critical Review and Future Directions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Insufficient effort responding (IER) presents a significant challenge in management research, potentially leading to flawed inferences. This review critically examines IER practices in 17 leading management journals from 2012 to 2023, highlighting inconsistencies in screening methods, cutoffs, and reporting. We find that IER screening is more prevalent in studies using online paid samples, experimental tasks, and computerized data collection. However, researchers’ IER-related practices, specifically the use of multiple detection methods, predicted IER removal rate above and beyond these study characteristics. Our review revealed that, despite increasing awareness, IER detection and reporting remain unstandardized, with varied practices across studies. While attention checks are frequently used, details about their implementation are often inadequately reported, and multiple detection methods, though recommended, are inconsistently applied. Variability in cutoffs and reliance on single-item checks raise concerns about the risk of retaining IER cases or mistakenly excluding attentive respondents. Our assessment of the impact of IER removal suggests that while it generally improves reliability and model fit, its effect can vary widely across measures and studies. We call on methodologists to resolve existing inconsistencies by developing clearer, empirically derived guidelines for IER detection and removal. We urge researchers to adopt more comprehensive and transparent reporting practices to enhance replicability and methodological rigor, with a flowchart to guide research design and method communication. This review underscores the need for a more systematic approach to IER mitigation in management research to enhance data quality and research validity.</content>

    <title>Self-Preferencing and Search Neutrality in Online Retail Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent regulations on search neutrality prohibit retail platforms from self-preferentially prioritizing their first-party products over those of third-party sellers in consumers’ search rankings. This paper shows that, despite its good intention, search neutrality may unintendedly harm consumers and third-party sellers because of the strategic decisions of the platform and third-party sellers. In the short term, search neutrality can weaken the price competition between the platform and third-party sellers, which will hurt consumers if many of them ex ante prefer the third-party product, and can increase the platform’s profit if many consumers ex ante prefer the first-party product. In the long term, search neutrality can incentivize the platform to preempt the entry of third-party sellers if their entry cost is intermediate, further harming consumers and third-party sellers. Both unintended harms stem from two unique features of online retailing platforms: platforms personalize consumers’ search rankings, and consumers observe product prices before searching a product in depth. Alternative formulations of search neutrality, consumers’ search costs, and their product match likelihoods are considered to demonstrate the robustness of the main results.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Conflict of Interest Statement: All authors certify that they have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with any financial interest or nonfinancial interest in the subject matter or materials discussed in this manuscript.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01795 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a comprehensive database of corporate relocation events in the United States from 1994 to 2017, we investigate the impact of headquarters relocation on the local economy by examining its spillover effects on the housing market. We find that headquarters relocation into a district at zip code level leads to 10% higher housing price growth. We also document a temporal spillover effect whereby housing prices increase one year before the relocation and rise further until two years afterward and a significant spatial spillover effect of corporate relocation on nearby zip codes’ housing markets up to 15 miles. We show the positive spillover effect on housing price growth is more pronounced for relocating firms with larger employee sizes and economic bases. We further find local economic spillover and agglomeration economies associated with corporate relocation. Overall, our study indicates that corporate relocation exhibits a significant impact on the local housing market.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: The project received research grant from the Alrov Institute for Real Estate Research.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.01819 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The main contribution of this paper resides in developing a new algorithmic approach for addressing the continuous-time joint replenishment problem, termed [Formula: see text]-pairwise alignment. The latter mechanism, through which we synchronize multiple economic order quantity models, allows us to devise a purely combinatorial algorithm for efficiently approximating optimal policies within any degree of accuracy. As a result, our work constitutes the first quantitative improvement over power-of-2 policies, which have been state-of-the-art in this context since the mid-1980s. Moreover, in light of recent intractability results, by proposing an efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme for the joint replenishment problem, we resolve the long-standing open question regarding the computational complexity of this classical setting.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: This work was supported by the Israel Science Foundation [Grant 1407/20].</content>

    <title>Optimizing Offline Product Design and Online Assortment Policy: Measuring the Relative Impact of Each Decision</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Revenue management decisions often involve both offline and online decisions. Offline decisions are made first and establish the broad and long-term operational context in which online decisions are frequently and repeatedly made, often in real time. We consider a joint optimization of offline and online decisions. Specifically, we examine a setting in which the offline decision concerns the selection of product-design characteristics (e.g., price, capacity, return eligibility, and other characteristics) and the online decision concerns the dynamic assortment optimization over a selling season. Our formulation has many applications, including optimizing products’ return eligibility and determining product discounts, and a key feature of our model is its explicit consideration of complex return dynamics and accompanying financial implications. We formulate an optimization problem that combines the impact of both offline and online decisions on the expected revenue. To determine the product design, we reformulate the choice-based deterministic linear program, solve its continuous relaxation, and round the resulting solution. Using value function approximations enables us to obtain a dynamic assortment policy whose expected revenue is at least a constant fraction of the choice-based deterministic linear program. Combining these two results, we show that our approach provides an approximate solution to the joint optimization problem with performance guarantees. Numerical experiments based on real transaction data from a major U.S. retailer show that our method achieves 95%–97% effectiveness, an advantage of up to 18% over methods that disregard the interplay between offline and online decisions. This framework also yields a systematic quantitative measure of the relative importance of both offline and online decisions. Based on this measure, numerical experiments highlight the crucial role of product design, accounting for 94% and 85% of the observed variation in effectiveness across various methods in applications involving volume discount and return eligibility, respectively.This paper was accepted by Victor Martinez de Albeniz, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation’s Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation [Grant 2226901].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01167 .</content>

    <title>Does Bank Monitoring Reduce Corporate Misreporting? Evidence from Foreign Bank Entry in China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a model of bank monitoring and borrower financial misreporting. Using the staggered liberalization of the banking sector in China as a natural experiment, we find that, consistent with the model’s prediction, entry by more efficient foreign banks reduces corporate misreporting fraud. Fraud reduction is greatest among borrowers of foreign banks, but fraud also drops among borrowers of domestic banks, suggesting a spillover effect. As predicted by the model, fraud reduction is greatest for borrowers with higher levels of fixed assets or lower levels of current assets. Our evidence suggests that improved bank monitoring reduces financial misreporting.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Funding: M.

    <title>Who Does the Talking Here? The Impact of Gender Composition on Team Interactions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze how the gender composition of teams affects team interactions. In an online experiment, we randomly assign individuals to gender-homogenous or gender-mixed teams of four. Teams meet in an audio chat room and jointly work on a team task that is gender-neutral in terms of individual productivity. By design, effects on team performance can only work through communication. We find that all-male teams communicate more than all-female teams and outperform teams of both alternative gender compositions. In mixed teams, men strongly dominate the team conversation quantitatively. Considering the ranking in terms of communication shares in mixed teams, we document that high-skilled men talk the most, followed by low-skilled men. High-skilled women talk more than low-skilled women, but much less than low-skilled men. We conclude that gender composition significantly impacts the way how teams exchange information.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [RI 1959/5-1] and Hans-Frisch-Stiftung.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03411 .</content>

    <title>Global Sensitivity Analysis via Optimal Transport</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the construction of variable importance measures for multivariate responses using the theory of optimal transport. We start with the classical optimal transport formulation. We show that the resulting sensitivity indices are well-defined under input dependence, are equal to zero under statistical independence, and are maximal under fully functional dependence. Also, they satisfy a continuity property for information refinements. We show that the new indices encompass Wagner’s variance-based sensitivity measures. Moreover, they provide deeper insights into the effect of an input’s uncertainty, quantifying its impact on the output mean, variance, and higher-order moments. We then consider the entropic formulation of the optimal transport problem and show that the resulting global sensitivity measures satisfy the same properties, with the exception that, under statistical independence, they are minimal, but not necessarily equal to zero. We prove the consistency of a given-data estimation strategy and test the feasibility of algorithmic implementations based on alternative optimal transport solvers. Application to the assemble-to-order simulator reveals a significant difference in the key drivers of uncertainty between the case in which the quantity of interest is profit (univariate) or inventory (multivariate). The new importance measures contribute to meeting the increasing demand for methods that make black-box models more transparent to analysts and decision makers.This paper was accepted by Baris Ata, stochastic models and simulation.Funding: A.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the consequences of holding multiple accounts for payout decisions at retirement. Using proprietary data of retirees’ annuitization decisions, we find that small accounts are more likely to be cashed out. We use occupation information as a proxy for wealth to disentangle income from the multiple-accounts effect. We show that individuals with high expected wages are more likely to annuitize overall but less likely to annuitize their small accounts (comparing to individuals with low wages). A laboratory experiment and an online experimental survey (with a large representative sample) suggest that the composition of multiple accounts affects the annuitization rates via the decisions regarding small versus large accounts.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the Albertson-Waltuch Chair in Business Administration, the Kruger Center at the Hebrew University, the Think Forward Initiative, and the German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development and by funding from the Center for Agriculture, Environment and Natural Resource.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02489 .</content>

    <title>The Value of Robust Assortment Optimization Under Ranking-Based Choice Models</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a class of robust assortment optimization problems that was proposed by Farias et al. [Farias VF, Jagabathula S, Shah D (2013) A nonparametric approach to modeling choice with limited data. Management Sci. 59(2):305–322]. The goal in these problems is to find an assortment that maximizes a firm’s worst-case expected revenue under all ranking-based choice models that are consistent with the historical sales data generated by the firm’s past assortments. We establish for various settings that these robust optimization problems can either be solved in polynomial time or can be reformulated as compact mixed-integer optimization problems. To establish our results, we prove that optimal assortments for these robust optimization problems have a simple structure that is closely related to the structure of revenue-ordered assortments. We use our results to show how robust optimization can be used to overcome the risks of estimate-then-optimize and the need for experimentation with ranking-based choice models in the overparameterized regime.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.04059 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this study, we provide evidence on the effects of state tax whistleblower laws. We exploit a novel 2010 amendment to New York’s False Claims Acts (FCA) that explicitly extended whistleblower incentives to corporate income tax whistleblowers. We identify treated firms (firms exposed to New York’s FCA) using establishment-level data and descriptive analyses. Using a sample of firms exposed to New York and neighboring states, we find evidence that New York’s FCA reduced state tax avoidance. In cross-sectional tests, we find that effects are increasing in firms that grant fewer employee stock options and industry regulation, consistent with deterrence increasing in employee and regulator monitoring. We also find evidence that New York’s FCA deterred federal tax avoidance, consistent with positive vertical tax externalities. Next, we focus on particular tax strategies and find evidence of a reduced probability of Double Irish tax structures, reduced relationships to tax planning banks, reduced use of special purpose vehicles, and reduced outbound tax-motivated income shifting. We also find evidence that firms with the lowest (highest) cost of relocation (1) reduced (did not change) establishment counts in New York but (2) did not change (reduced) state tax avoidance. Finally, we disentangle general ex ante deterrence from ex ante peer deterrence using hand-collected New York tax whistleblower press releases from the Attorney General. We find evidence of both types of deterrence. Overall, this study provides policy-relevant evidence on the deterrence effects of tax whistleblower laws.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: Y.

    <title>Batching and Optimal Multistage Bipartite Allocations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In several applications of real-time matching of demand to supply in online marketplaces, the platform allows for some latency to batch the demand and improve the efficiency of the resulting matching. Motivated by these applications, we study the optimal trade-off between batching and inefficiency in the context of designing robust online allocations. As our base model, we consider K-stage variants of the classic vertex-weighted bipartite b-matching in the adversarial setting, where online vertices arrive stagewise and in K batches—in contrast to online arrival. Our main result for this problem is an optimal [Formula: see text]-competitive (fractional) matching algorithm, improving the classic [Formula: see text]-competitive ratio bound known for its online variant [Mehta A, Saberi A, Vazirani U, Vazirani V (2007) Ad words and generalized online matching. J. ACM 54(5):22–es; Aggarwal G, Goel G, Karande C, Mehta A (2011) Online vertex weighted bipartite matching and single-bid budgeted allocations. Proc. 22nd Annual ACM-SIAM Sympos. Discrete Algorithms (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Philadelphia), 1253–1264]. We also extend this result to the general problem of multistage configuration allocation with free disposals [Devanur NR, Huang Z, Korula N, Mirrokni VS, Yan Q (2016) Whole page optimization and submodular welfare maximization with online bidders. ACM Trans. Econom. Comput. 4(3):1–20], which is motivated by the display advertising application in the context of video streaming platforms. Our main technique at a high level is developing algorithmic tools to vary the trade-off between “greediness” and “hedging” of the matching algorithm across stages. We rely on a particular family of convex programming–based matchings that distribute the demand in a specifically balanced way among supply in different stages while carefully modifying the balancedness of the resulting matching across stages. More precisely, we identify a sequence of polynomials with decreasing degrees to be used as strictly concave regularizers of the maximum weight–matching linear program to form these convex programs. At each stage, our fractional multistage algorithm returns the corresponding regularized optimal solution as the matching of this stage (by solving the convex program). By providing structural decomposition of the underlying graph using the optimal solutions of these convex programs and recursively connecting the regularizers together, we develop a new multistage primal-dual framework to analyze the competitive ratio of this algorithm. We further show this algorithm is optimal competitive, even in the unweighted case, by providing an upper bound instance in which no online algorithm obtains a competitive ratio better than [Formula: see text]. For the extension to multistage configuration allocation, we introduce a novel extension of our regularized convex program that provides separate regularization at different “price levels.” Despite the lack of a relevant graph decomposition in this extension, in contrast to our base model, we show how we can directly use convex duality to set up a primal-dual analysis framework for our new algorithm.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: R.

    <title>The Impact of Peer Performance and Relative Rank on Managerial Career Attainment: Evidence from College Students</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The ranking system within academic environments may impact future professional trajectories. Examining the influence of class rank on college students’ managerial attainment is crucial for understanding some determinants of career advancement. This paper estimates the effect of a low rank in a high-performing class on the probability of college students attaining a managerial position in the future. Our data combine administrative records from a highly selective university in Brazil and employment registries. For most programs, this university divides first-year students into two classes based on their preferences and admission scores. In a regression discontinuity design, we control for students’ preferences and inherent skills by comparing the last student admitted to the high-score class (the “first class”) with the first student excluded from this class, who joins the “second class.” Results show that the last student in the first class is 10 percentage points less likely to attain a managerial position soon after graduating than a similar student in the second class. Although this effect is initially similar between genders, it diminishes for men over time while persisting for women. Overall, our study indicates that better-performing peers can hinder a student’s managerial career by lowering their relative rank in the classroom.This paper was accepted by Isabel Fernandez-Mateo, organizations.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02988 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An influential line of research emphasizes that colonial legacy plays a key role in formal financial development. Can colonial legacy also shape informal finance? We investigate the impact of colonial legacy on informal financial development using a manually georeferenced data set within a credible empirical framework. In the 19th century, Europeans arbitrarily designed colonial borders that partitioned many ethnicities across multiple countries in Africa. Leveraging several spatial regression discontinuity designs across national borders and within British-French–partitioned Cameroon and a unique natural experiment where the same former British colony is compared with two otherwise similar areas with different exposures to French colonization, we discover that former British colonies today have better informal financial development than former French colonies. Exploring the channels, we find that places with a British colonial legacy maintain a style of social control that facilitates information flow, supports private enforcement and market interactions, and promotes strong legal cultures.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: C.

    <title>Don’t Fake It If You Can’t Make It: Driver Misconduct in Last-Mile Delivery</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the last two decades, last-mile delivery (LMD) firms have seen immense growth fueled by the success of e-commerce, leading to faster and cheaper deliveries. Operating on thin margins, LMD firms strive for successful first-time deliveries to avoid the financial and reputational costs of reattempts. Delivery agents (DAs) are integral to LMD efficiency, influencing customer experience, delivery success, and productivity. However, most LMD performance enhancement research focuses on process, technology, and incentives, which presume workers will conform to procedures and monitoring tools will function flawlessly. Nevertheless, in practice, DAs deviate from expected behaviors, that is, indulge in misconduct, negatively affecting delivery efficiency, often resulting in returned parcels. One of the major forms of misconduct is entering fake remarks about deliveries, wherein DAs intentionally do not deliver the parcels and provide fake reasons for it. For instance, even without reaching a delivery address, a DA remarks “customer unavailable” and records a delivery failure. In this study, we collaborated with a leading Indian LMD firm and, using instrumental variable regression, found that such misconduct leads to a spillover productivity loss. This effect reduces the next day’s successful deliveries by 1.60% and first-time-right deliveries by 1.86%. We discuss misconduct’s correlation with factors such as task complexity and offer novel insights into how opportunistic circumstances can influence worker behavior.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Funding: V.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To understand the disruption and implications of distributed ledger technologies for financial reporting and auditing, we analyze firm misreporting, auditor monitoring and competition, and regulatory policy in a unified model. A federated blockchain for financial reporting and auditing can improve verification efficiency not only for transactions in private databases but also for cross-chain verifications through privacy-preserving computation protocols. Despite the potential benefit of blockchains, private incentives for firms and first-mover advantages for auditors can create inefficient under-adoption or partial adoption that favors larger auditors. Although a regulator can help coordinate the adoption of technology, endogenous choice of transaction partners by firms can still lead to adoption failure. Our model also provides an initial framework for further studies of the costs and implications of the use of distributed ledgers and secure multiparty computation in financial reporting, including the positive spillover to discretionary auditing and who should bear the cost of adoption.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, finance.Funding: The authors gratefully acknowledge research support from the FinTech Laboratory at J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper establishes the optimal selling mechanism when a seller can incentivize an existing buyer to refer his privately known potential buyer to participate. We identify three optimal channels for providing referral incentives. First, if the existing buyer declares that no potential buyer exists, his virtual value is penalized. Second, if the existing buyer refers the potential buyer to the seller, his virtual value is boosted. Third, in some scenarios where this carrots-and-sticks-via-virtual-value approach is insufficient for creating proper referral incentives, the existing buyer is then given a constant referral bonus for referring the potential buyer. We also provide conditions under which the optimal mechanism can be implemented using simple mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate that the conventional resale mechanism is suboptimal.This paper was accepted by Itai Ashlagi, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: H.

    <title>The Marginal Value of Cash: Structural Estimates from a Model with Financing and Agency Frictions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How much value does an additional dollar of cash create for a firm? It is generally recognized that the marginal value of cash (MVC) can either exceed or fall below one dollar. Estimates of MVC can guide corporate cash and payout policy, indicate the quality of governance, and make a firm a target for takeover or activism. Yet the existing methods of estimation lack a rigorous theoretical foundation and often provide implausibly high or low estimates. In this paper, we provide a formulation of MVC and structurally estimate the MVC based on a model that encompasses the important determinants for the choice of cash savings, including financing and agency costs. We find that firms with large cash and capital stocks have lower marginal value of cash, whereas the relationship between leverage and marginal value of cash is hump shaped. Two quasi-natural experiments validate the MVC estimates.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: D.

    <title>Seductive Language for Narcissists in Job Postings</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research indicates that narcissistic executives engage in earnings management and other negative organizational behaviors, and many studies ponder why firms hire such individuals, especially into corporate accounting positions. Utilizing a selection of terms from real-world job postings that we characterize as describing either a “Rule-Bender” or “Rule-Follower” candidate, we first conduct several validation studies which reveal that these terms vary predictably across types of job postings, that people generally agree with our categorization of these terms, and that Rule-Benders are viewed as possessing worse managerial skills but a higher proclivity for unethical behavior. We then demonstrate that narcissistic job seekers are more attracted to job postings that describe the ideal candidate using Rule-Bender terms for both general positions (Experiment 1) and senior accounting positions (Experiment 2). Finally, we examine firm characteristics that might lead professional recruiters to incorporate Rule-Bender language into Chief Accounting Officer job postings and find that Rule-Bender terms are preferred for higher-growth, higher-innovation firms (Experiment 3), and when more aggressive reporting would benefit the firm (Experiment 4). Our results suggest that recruiters’ language choices can attract Rule-Bending narcissists to firms, perhaps even in unintended circumstances.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05254 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a dynamic general equilibrium model with costly-to-short stocks and heterogeneous beliefs. Costly short sales drive a wedge between the valuation of assets that promise identical cash flows but that are subject to different trading arrangements. In particular, we show that the price of an asset is given by the risk-adjusted present value of its future cash flows, which include both dividends and an endogenous lending yield that we characterize explicitly. This valuation formula implies that stocks with low and high shorting costs should offer similar risk-return trade-off once returns are appropriately adjusted for lending revenues and thus, sheds light on recent empirical findings about the explanatory power of shorting costs in the cross-section of returns.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01887 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Analyzing the specifications of pricing models for the joint valuation of S&amp;P 500 and VIX options, I find that the existing models cannot adequately represent the two options markets. I introduce a new factor that controls the higher-order moments of the risk-neutral return distribution. The model I propose significantly outperforms all other alternatives, and particularly improves on the benchmark two-variance-factor model with cojumps by 23.66% in-sample and 31.64% out-of-sample. The performance analysis shows that the better fit results from improvements in the modeling of both S&amp;P 500 and VIX options, highlighting the model features that are critical for reconciling the two markets.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72233003 and 72303233].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00327 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study biases and the informativeness of subjective performance evaluations in an online experiment, testing the implications of a standard formal framework of rational subjective evaluations. In the experiment, subjects in the role of workers perform a real effort task. Subjects in the role of supervisors observe samples of the workers’ output and assess their performance. We conduct six experimental treatments varying (i) whether workers’ pay depends on the performance evaluation, (ii) whether supervisors are paid for the accuracy of their evaluations, and (iii) the precision of the information available to supervisors. Moreover, we use the exogenous assignment of supervisors to workers to investigate the association between supervisors’ social preferences and their rating quality. In line with the model of optimal evaluations, we find that ratings are more lenient and less informative when they determine bonus payments. Rewards for accuracy reduce leniency and can enhance informativeness. When supervisors have access to more detailed performance information, their ratings vary more with the performance signal and become more informative. Contrary to expectations, we do not find that more prosocial supervisors are systematically more lenient when their ratings affect workers’ payoffs. Instead, they are more diligent in their rating behavior, resulting in more accurate and informative performance evaluations.This paper was accepted by Marie Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: Funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany’s Excellence Strategy [Grant EXC 2126/1-390838866].Supplemental Material: The online supplement and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02267 .</content>

    <title>Matching and Pricing in Ride Hailing: Wild Goose Chases and How to Solve Them</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that ride-hailing markets are prone to a matching failure (“wild goose chases”) in which high demand sets off a harmful feedback cycle of few idle drivers, high pickup times, and low earnings, drastically reducing welfare. After characterizing these failures theoretically and showing empirical evidence of their relevance, we analyze how platforms can avoid them. Raising prices brings demand back under control. Platforms can thus set a uniform high price, or they can use high “surge” pricing during high demand times while keeping prices low at other times. Some adjustments to the matching algorithm can also avoid the problem, but surge pricing performs better than them.This paper was accepted by Itai Ashlagi, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: This research was supported by the Kapnick Foundation Fellowship through a grant to the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research and by the John S. and James L.

    <title>A Dynamic Matching Mechanism for College Admissions: Theory and Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Market design provides managerial insights into the success and failure of various market institutions in allocating scarce resources. We investigate a dynamic matching mechanism used in real-world college admissions, where students share a common priority ranking. Theoretically, we prove that efficient and stable matching occurs with an arbitrarily high probability, assuming sufficient revision opportunities and rationality. This predicts that the dynamic mechanism is less stable than the deferred acceptance mechanism and less efficient than the Boston mechanism. We confirm this prediction in a low-complexity laboratory setting. However, in a high-complexity setting, the dynamic mechanism matches the stability of the deferred acceptance and the efficiency of the Boston mechanism, as both underperform in this setting. This finding indicates that the dynamic mechanism is more resilient to increased complexity. We attribute this resilience to its belief-independent characterization of rationalizable strategies. Beyond college admissions, the dynamic mechanism has potential applications in housing assignments, job allocations, and ascending auctions.This paper was accepted by Axel Ockenfels, decision analysis.Funding: B.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fund companies regularly send shareholder letters to their investors. We use textual analysis to investigate whether these letters’ writing style influences fund flows and whether it predicts performance and investment styles. Fund investors react to the tone and content of shareholder letters: a less negative tone leads to higher net flows. Thus, fund companies can use shareholder letters as a tactical instrument to influence flows. However, at the same time, a dishonest communication that is not consistent with the fund’s actual performance decreases flows. A positive writing style predicts higher idiosyncratic risk as well as more style bets, whereas there is no consistent predictive power for future performance.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03417 .</content>

    <title>How Does Artificial Intelligence Shape Audit Firms?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does artificial intelligence (AI) displace auditors? We exploit the staggered hiring of AI employees at audit office locations across the United States as a proxy for the use of AI at local audit offices. The main findings are as follows. First, relative to audit offices that do not yet hire AI employees, those that do hire AI employees have a 4.3% increase in the number of auditor jobs, particularly among junior and midlevel auditors. Second, using AI is associated with an increased demand for soft skills (e.g., cognitive skills) in auditor jobs. Third, audit offices that use AI have more accurate going concern and internal control opinions. Semistructured interviews of 11 seasoned audit partners confirm that investment in AI is centralized at the national level, but the decision to deploy it often resides at the local audit office level. Notably, none of the partners believe that AI has replaced or will replace human auditors. Overall, our study—comprising both empirical and qualitative data—suggests that using AI does not replace auditors, but rather changes the skills required for these jobs and improves audit quality.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: K.

    <title>Coopetition in Platform-Based Retailing: On the Platform’s Entry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the dynamic incentive interactions between a platform and a third-party seller over two stages, where the seller exerts product-value-enhancement effort in the first stage in anticipation of the platform’s potential entry in the second stage. Upon entry, the platform can exert effort to boost the value of the product sold by the platform, with positive spillovers to the value of the product sold by the platform. We show the existence of both the protective and the receptive regimes, characterizing the necessary and sufficient conditions for each regime. These conditions are of thresholds type with respect to the parameters including the degree of spillover, the referral rate, and the competition intensity. In the protective (receptive) regime, the seller is worse (better) off with the platform’s entry than without, thereby distorting effort downward (upward) from the first best to deter (induce) the platform’s entry to the products of intermediate value. Notably, if the spillover effect is negative, only the protective regime will arise. We also provide the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the platform’s nonentry commitment strictly improves the platform’s profits by restoring the seller’s effort to the first best, achieving the win-win outcome for both the platform and the seller.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: H.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents a theoretical framework for determining the ownership stakes held by financial investors in companies competing in the same product market, commonly referred to as the level of common ownership. In our model, these investors are primarily motivated by the anticipation of capital gains resulting from the impact of common ownership on product market competition, which enhances profitability for the firms involved. However, common ownership also undermines effective corporate governance by diminishing blockholders’ incentives to engage in value-enhancing behaviors, such as managerial monitoring. These adverse effects on corporate governance act as limiting factors, ultimately determining the equilibrium level of common ownership.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When an agent receives information from a source whose accuracy might be either high or low, standard theory dictates that she update as if the source has medium accuracy. In a laboratory experiment, subjects deviate from this benchmark by reacting less to uncertain sources, especially when the sources release good news. This pattern is validated using observational data on stock price reactions to analyst earnings forecasts, where analysts with no forecast records are classified as uncertain sources. A theory of belief updating where agents are insensitive and averse to information accuracy uncertainty can explain these results.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: Y.

    <title>Stress Testing Spillover Risk in Mutual Funds</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a framework to quantify the vulnerability of mutual funds to fire-sale spillover losses. We account for the first-mover incentive that results from the mismatch between the liquidity offered to redeeming investors and the liquidity of assets held by the funds. In our framework, the negative feedback loop between investors’ redemptions and price impact from asset sales leads to an aggregate change in funds’ net asset value, which is determined as a fixed point of a nonlinear mapping. We show that a higher concentration of first movers increases the aggregate vulnerability of the system as measured by the ratio between endogenous losses triggered by fund redemptions and exogenous losses caused by initial price shocks only. When calibrated to U.S. mutual funds, our model shows that, in stressed market scenarios, spillover losses are significantly amplified through a nonlinear response to initial shocks that results from the first-mover incentive. Higher spillover losses provide a stronger incentive to redeem early, further increasing fire-sale losses and the transmission of shocks through overlapping portfolio holdings.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, finance.Funding: The research of A.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers can sometimes be exploited because they make mistakes in their valuation of products. We present the results from a large-scale experimental study that examines whether third-party spectators from the general population in the United States cancel a voluntary deal where a buyer has made a mistake in the valuation of a product and agreed to pay more for the product than the seller knows it is worth. We find that the majority of the spectators cancel such deals, even when the seller’s involvement is limited to accepting a proposal made by the buyer. A substantial share of these spectators is also willing to fine the seller. However, a large minority of the spectators are willing to uphold the deal even when the seller has proposed the deal and obfuscated the information provided to the buyer. Our results shed new light on when people view market transactions as acceptable and their attitudes to government regulation of businesses.This paper was accepted by Axel Ockenfels, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This project was financed with support from the Norges Forskningsråd [Centres of Excellence Scheme Centre for Experimental Research on Fairness, Inequality and Rationality Project 262675 Grants 236995, 250415, 262636, and 302145].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that private equity leveraged buyouts reduce perceived job quality despite not impacting average base pay. This appears to reflect employees bearing more risk. Both job quality and employee incentive pay are more related to firm performance at private equity-owned companies than at public control firms with 1% higher deal rate of return associated with 0.7% more employee incentive pay. Deals with high leverage and employees with worse outside options fuel the declines in job satisfaction after a buyout. Our results highlight how job quality is tied to job security and how ownership affects employees through mechanisms beyond base pay.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Funding: W.

    <title>Double Marginalization Because of External Financing: Capacity Investment Under Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper considers a firm’s investment decision determining the timing and capacity level in a dynamic setting with demand uncertainty. Its investment is financed by borrowing from a lender that has market power, generating a capital market inefficiency. We show that the firm’s investment is subject to double marginalization in the sense that the need for external financing results in a considerably smaller investment and thus, a reduction in welfare. In addition, we find that the presence of the bankruptcy option mitigates the double-marginalization effect unless the bankruptcy cost is small. The firm’s investment size is increasing in bankruptcy costs, albeit at the expense of an investment delay. Based on this, an increase of bankruptcy costs raises social welfare.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Funding: X. Wen and H.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms have inefficiently low incentives to innovate when other firms benefit from their inventions and the innovating firm therefore does not capture the full surplus of its innovations. We show that, in theory, common ownership of firms mitigates this impediment to corporate innovation. By contrast, without technological spillovers, innovation has the effect of stealing market share from rivals and in that case more common ownership reduces innovation. Empirically, the association between common ownership and innovation inputs and outputs decreases with product market proximity and increases with technology proximity. The sign and magnitude of the overall relationship between common ownership and corporate innovation thus varies considerably across the universe of firms depending on their relative proximity in technology and product market space. Some of these results persist if we use only variation from BlackRock’s acquisition of BGI. Our findings inform the debate about the welfare effects of increasing common ownership among U.S. corporations.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: The authors acknowledge grant funding from the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite strong theoretical predictions based on disagreement, limited empirical evidence links short-selling restrictions to higher prices. We test this relationship using quasi-experimental methods based on rule 201, a threshold-based policy that restricts aggressive short selling when intraday returns cross −10%. When comparing stocks on either side of the threshold in the same hour of trading, we find that the restriction leads to 8% lower short-sale volume and 35 basis points higher daily returns. These price effects do not reverse after the restriction is lifted.This paper was accepted by Bruno Biais, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.4987 .</content>

    <title>Adaptive Preference Measurement with Unstructured Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many products are most meaningfully described using unstructured data such as text or images. Unstructured data are also common in e-commerce, in which products are often described by photos and text but not with standardized sets of attributes. Whereas much is known about how to efficiently measure consumer preferences when products can be meaningfully described by structured attributes, there is scant research on doing the same for unstructured data. This paper introduces a real-time, adaptive survey design framework for measuring preferences over unstructured data, leveraging Bayesian optimization. By adaptively choosing items to display based on uncertainty around a nonparametric utility model, the proposed method maximizes information gain per question, enabling quick estimation of individual-level preferences. The approach operates on embeddings of the unstructured data, thereby eliminating the requirement for manual coding of product attributes. We apply the method to measuring preferences over clothing and highlight its potential for both the general task of marketing research and the specific task of designing customer onboarding surveys to mitigate the cold-start recommendation problem. We also develop methods for interpreting the nonparametric utility functions, which allow us to reconstruct consumer valuations of discrete attributes, even for attributes that were not considered or available a priori.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Fundings: Funding for this project was provided by Analytics at Wharton, the Wharton Behavioral Lab, and the Wharton Dean’s Fund.

    <title>Feature Misspecification in Sequential Learning Problems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a class of sequential learning problems where a decision maker must learn the unknown statistical characteristics of a finite set of alternatives (or systems) using sequential sampling to ultimately select a subset of “good” alternatives. A salient feature of our problem is that system performance is governed by a set of features. The decision maker postulates the dependence on these features to be linear, but this model may not precisely represent the true underlying system structure. We show that this misspecification, if not managed properly, can lead to suboptimal performance because of a phenomenon identified as sample-selection endogeneity. We propose a prospective sampling principle—a new approach that eliminates the adverse effects of misspecification as the number of samples grows large. The proposed principle applies across a very general class of widely used sampling policies, enjoys strong asymptotic performance guarantees, and exhibits effective finite-sample performance in numerical experiments.This paper was accepted by Vivek Farias, data science.Funding: This work was supported by the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation [Grant 2020063] and the Hong Kong Research Grant Council [GRF Grant 16501821 and ECS Grant 24210420].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00328 .</content>

    <title>Intersectionality: Affirmative Action with Multidimensional Identities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Studying the design of affirmative action policies when identities are multidimensional, we provide a formal demonstration of the importance of intersectionality. Prevailing affirmative action policies are based only on one identity dimension (e.g., race, gender, socioeconomic class). We find that any such nonintersectional policy can almost never achieve a representative outcome. In fact, nonintersectional policies often increase the underrepresentation of underrepresented groups in a manner undetected by standard measures. Examples based on race and gender reveal significant hidden inequality arising from nonintersectional policies. We show how to construct intersectional policies that achieve proportional representation.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund [FG 6-G, I 3487] and the Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-19-CE48-0018-01, ANR-19-P3IA-0003, and ANR-23-PEIA-0003].</content>

    <title>Do Physicians Improve More from Positive or Negative Feedback?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use clinical data on more than 240,000 surgeries and quasi-experimental methods to examine how physicians respond to the surprise release of a performance “report card.” Such feedback interventions are commonly used to encourage physicians to improve performance yet show limited evidence of success. Our results show that these limited effects mask heterogeneous behavioral responses to feedback valence. In particular, physicians improve more from positive feedback than from negative feedback, with negative feedback even reducing performance for a nontrivial share of patients. Experiments with laypersons replicate these results and show that struggles with negative feedback can be mitigated by giving incentives directly tied to improvement and by adding qualitative information that helps individuals interpret past performance. These results are consistent with behavioral models that suggest cognitive and emotional difficulties limit how well individuals use negative feedback. Thus, feedback interventions in healthcare should be carefully designed to mitigate these counterproductive behavioral responses.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: We acknowledge generous funding provided by Tilburg University and the University of Massachusetts Amherst to run the laboratory experiments.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01340 .</content>

    <title>Prismatic Trust: How Structural and Behavioral Signals in Networks Explain Trust Accumulation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The predominant focus of the organizational literature on trust has been on direct interactions between actors. Whereas this emphasis has solidified our understanding of the dyadic foundations of trust, we know relatively little about the mechanisms of trust creation in network contexts. In this paper, we introduce the network mechanism of prismatic trust to explain why some actors are more trusted than others. Specifically, we posit that networks act as prisms that generate signals of trustworthiness based on not only actors’ positions in the social structure, but also their networking behavior. Moreover, we also theorize that the combination of signals from network structure and behavior amplifies trust accumulation in network actors. We test our predictions using data from an online social trading platform with more than 28,000 traders across 38 weeks. We find that traders who occupy positions of higher status in the network and those who express positive sentiments in the content of their communications (networking behaviors), accumulate more trustors. Furthermore, the positive effects of network status and the expression of positive sentiments on trust accumulation are mutually reinforcing. In sum, we contribute to the organizational literature on trust by proposing the role of a prismatic view in explaining how trust accumulates in network actors as a function of their position in social structure, their networking behavior, and a combination of the two.This paper was accepted by Isabel Fernandez-Mateo, organizations.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02810 .</content>

    <title>Fast Delivery: B2B Field Experiments Amid COVID-19 Outbreak and New Normal</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Procuring essential products during disasters can save lives and livelihoods; nevertheless, limited research has explored this critical issue. In this paper, we collaborate with a buying company to run a unique B2B field experiment during the early COVID-19 outbreak that prompts an urgent need for personal protective equipment. We find that suppliers would deliver products faster by quoting a significantly shorter lead time when the buying company purchases products for donation rather than for resale. Similarly, suppliers quote a shorter lead time when the company provides crisis information—the number of COVID-19 cases in the region with high crisis levels—to highlight the urgent need for products. Interestingly, faster delivery does not come at the expense of the buying company. Buyers receive the products faster but also pay less. We collaborate with the same company to rerun the field experiment in the new normal and find that the buyer’s intent of donation leads to shorter lead time but not to lower wholesale price. Moreover, providing the COVID-19 information of the local community to suppliers has no impact on their decisions. Overall, our paper provides the first empirical evidence on suppliers’ lead time and wholesale price decisions during and after a disaster, thereby helping companies to deliver emergency products in a timely and efficient manner as well as designing their philanthropic and information strategies.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by a Behavioral Research Assistance Grant from the C.

    <title>LIBOR Discontinuation and the Cost of Bank Loans</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) being replaced by risk-free rate (RFR)-based alternative reference rates, the fundamental differences between the two benchmarking frameworks impose significant risks on banks. Exploiting the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)’s announcement of the phase-out of LIBOR, we conduct a difference-in-differences analysis based on banks’ reliance on LIBOR and show that LIBOR discontinuation entails higher interest rate spread of bank loans. The result implies that banks tend to compensate for the LIBOR-to-RFR risks by passing on the transition costs to borrowers. This effect is attenuated if multiple benchmarks are already in use, for relationship lending, and among banks operating in a competitive environment. We further find that LIBOR discontinuation leads to more collateral and covenant requirements in loan terms. After the FCA announcement, banks are inclined to switch away from LIBOR dependence by referencing alternative rates.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Funding: J.-B.

    <title>Shuffling as a Sales Tactic: An Experimental Study of Selling Product Rankings</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the strategic interaction between a product expert and a consumer. The expert publicly commits to a ranking methodology to rank two products with uncertain relative merits; the consumer decides whether to acquire the ranking report to guide her product choice. The expert cares only about selling the report; the consumer derives utility from the product itself and an extra ranking attribute controlled by the expert. Strategic shuffling, in which the expert induces demand for his report by manipulating the uncertainty in product rankings, emerges as an equilibrium phenomenon. When the consumer highly values the top-ranked product, the expert-optimal equilibrium, which features shuffling, diverges from the consumer-optimal equilibrium. Laboratory evidence supports the predictions of the expert-optimal equilibrium. With limited field data because of the proprietary nature of ranking methodologies, our study provides useful alternative evidence on how ranking publishers may adopt methodologies that are not in consumers’ best interests.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the Office of the Vice President and Associate Provost for Research and Graduate Studies at Lehigh University [Faculty Research Grant 606975] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Key Project 72033006].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02088 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economists often measure discrimination as disparities arising from the direct effects of group identity. We develop new tools to model and measure systemic discrimination, capturing how discrimination in other decisions indirectly contributes to disparities. A novel experimental design, the Iterated Audit, identifies systemic discrimination. We then illustrate these new tools in two field experiments. The first experiment shows how racial discrimination can accumulate across multiple rounds of hiring through the interaction of two forces: greater discrimination against inexperienced workers, which affects the opportunity to obtain experience, and high subsequent returns to experience. The second experiment shows how gender-based differences in the language of recommendation letters can translate into systemic gender discrimination in STEM hiring. We discuss how our findings qualify previous results on direct discrimination and how our tools can be used to target policy interventions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a new foundation of risk aversion by showing that this attitude is fully captured by the propensity to seize insurance opportunities. In our main results, we first characterize Arrow-Pratt (1963–1964) risk aversion in terms of propensity to full insurance and the stronger notion of risk aversion of Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970) in terms of propensity to partial insurance. We then extend the analysis to comparative risk aversion by showing that the classical notion of Yaari (1969) corresponds to comparative propensity to full insurance, while the stronger notion of Ross (1981) corresponds to comparative propensity to partial insurance.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide the first evidence on how workers invest in human capital after losing ability. Using quasi-random work accidents in Danish administrative data, we find that workers enroll in bachelor’s programs after physical injuries, pursuing degrees that build on their past training and experience. Exploiting institutional differences in the stackability of degrees, we find that higher education moves injured workers from disability benefits to full-time employment, earning 25 percent more than before injury. Reskilling subsidies for injured workers pay for themselves four times over, and current rates of reskilling are substantially below the social optimum, especially for middle-aged workers.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entry represents a fundamental threat to cartels. We study the extent and effect of this behavior in the largest price-fixing case in US history, which involves generic drug manufacturing. We link information on the cartel’s internal operations to regulatory filings and market data. There is a substantial increase in entry after cartel formation, but regulatory approvals delay most entrants by two to four years. We estimate a structural model and simulate counterfactual equilibria. Absent entry, cartel profits would be dramatically higher. Correspondingly, reducing regulatory delays by just 1–2 years equates to consumer compensating variation of $612  million–$1.5  billion. (JEL L12, L13, L25, L51, L65, M31, O34)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The child mental health crisis has been described as the “defining public health crisis of our time.” This article addresses three myths about the crisis: (i) the idea that the crisis is new; (ii) the belief that increases in youth suicide mainly reflect deterioration in children’s underlying mental health; and (iii) the myth that investments in children have little impact on children’s mental health. In fact, the crisis has existed for decades, youth suicides vary asynchronously with other mental health measures and are impacted by external factors such as firearms legislation, and investments can improve child mental health and prevent suicide.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is substantial spatial heterogeneity in household carbon emissions. I leverage movers in two decades of administrative Decennial Census and American Community Survey data to estimate place effects—the amount by which carbon emissions change for the same household living in different places—for almost 1,000 cities and roughly 61,500 neighborhoods across the United States. I estimate that place effects account for 14–23 percent of overall heterogeneity. A change in neighborhood-level place effects from 1 standard deviation above the mean to 1 below would reduce household carbon emissions from residential energy and commuting by about 40 percent.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study one benefit to firms of selling subscriptions: the prospect that consumers will continue to pay for subscriptions they no longer value. We use comprehensive data from a large payment card network to document that months during which cards are replaced, when active renewal is required, are associated with much higher rates of cancellation. Using two stylized models of consumer inertia—driven by inattention or switching costs—we estimate that these cancellation frictions roughly double seller revenues on average, holding fixed initial subscribers. We use the estimated models to explore the impact of possible regulatory remedies. (JEL D12, D18, L81, L88)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With a growing mental health crisis and a shortage of behavioral health specialists, those seeking mental health treatment often face long wait times to obtain care. I study how clinic congestion affects mortality for veterans experiencing mental health emergencies. I find that longer waiting times make it more likely that patients miss their follow-up mental health visit, consequently increasing the probability that they permanently disengage from care. A 1 standard deviation increase in wait time between the emergency department visit and follow-up appointment date (11.7 days) increases two-year mortality by about 1.5 percent.

    <title>Efficiency in Household Decision-Making: Evidence from the Retirement Savings of US Couples</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how couples allocate retirement-saving contributions across each spouse’s account. In a new dataset covering over a million US individuals, we find retirement contributions are not allocated to the account with the highest employer match rate. This lack of coordination—which goes against the assumptions of most models of household decision-making—is common, costly, persistent over time, and cannot be explained by inertia, auto-enrollment, or simple heuristics. Complementing the administrative evidence with an online survey, we find that inefficient allocations reflect both financial mistakes as well as deliberate choices, especially when trust and commitment inside the households are weak.

    <title>When Do Nudges Increase Welfare?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use public finance sufficient statistic approaches to characterize the welfare effects of “nudges,” such as simplified information and warning labels, in markets with taxes and endogenous prices. While many studies focus on average effects, we show that welfare also depends on how the nudge affects the variance of choice distortions, and average effects become irrelevant with zero pass-through or optimal taxes. We implement the framework with experiments evaluating automotive fuel economy labels and sugary drink health labels. Labels decrease purchases of low-fuel economy cars and sugary drinks but may decrease welfare because they increase the variance of choice distortions.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is limited evidence on how university spin‐offs (USOs) respond to external crises. We fill this gap by assessing how UK digital USOs responded to the recent COVID‐19 pandemic. Specifically, we examine how USOs' capabilities (scaling‐up, fundraising, and intellectual property) and access to their parent university's financial resources/infrastructures interact intertemporally to address demand and supply challenges associated with the pandemic. Our analysis revealed that the interplay of (a) USOs' scaling‐up and fundraising capabilities and (b) USOs' fundraising capabilities and university parent's support infrastructure constituted the best strategy for developing intertemporal resilience during the crisis.Managerial SummaryWe investigate the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on digital USOs. Assuming support from parent universities, we explored how their scaling‐up efforts, fundraising efforts, and intellectual property addressed demand and supply challenges during these unprecedented times. First, USOs that could scale up while fundraising were more likely to sustain operations and satisfy demand through various stages of the pandemic. Second, USOs with fundraising capabilities and parent university support demonstrated greater resilience. These findings suggest valuable insights for CEOs of USOs and their parent universities in handling external crises.</content>

    <title>Do digital platforms create entrepreneurial opportunities? Evidence from marginal areas</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article enters the debate on the effects of digital platforms on entrepreneurial opportunities by estimating whether the entry of a home‐sharing platform shapes entrepreneurial decisions in marginal areas. We add a novel perspective to the literature, as we contend that when economic conditions are unfavorable, digital platforms, acting as External Enablers, stimulate entrepreneurship. We test these arguments on the unique setting of 270 Italian Borghi and the entry of Airbnb, employing a staggered difference‐in‐difference design. We show that, following the entry of Airbnb, the entrepreneurial activity of the surrounding area increases, with effects that are heterogeneous across sectors and stronger in more depressed areas. We also show qualitative–quantitative evidence of the mechanisms explaining these effects. Finally, we discuss theoretical contributions to digital‐entrepreneurship literature and implications.Managerial SummaryThis study provides implications for both prospective entrepreneurs and policymakers willing to incentivize the creation of new businesses in marginal and remote areas. First, we show that, in marginal locations, digital platforms act as facilitators for entrepreneurs facing a complex and risky decision to embark on new business activities, particularly, if these are along the scope of the platform. This happens because platforms create demand—if not existing—and reduce entry and operating costs by internalizing specific business processes. Second, we offer a clear recommendation to policymakers. We show that digital platforms represent an indirect and effective way of pursuing the development of entrepreneurship in marginal areas. This aspect is relevant as scholars have demonstrated that direct approaches are not always effective.</content>

    <title>Effort Redirection Across Multiple Career Tracks: Salary-Cut Policy and State-Owned Enterprises in China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior literature in agency theory assumes that when incentives decrease, agents may shirk and reduce effort. We extend this work to multiple career tracks and suggest that a salary decrease may not necessarily lead to effort reduction, but instead may redirect efforts across multiple career tracks. Using an exogenous salary-cut policy shock levied on top executives of Chinese central state-owned enterprises (SOEs), our difference-in-differences analysis reveals that salary cuts motivate SOE top executives to redirect efforts from improving internal management (i.e., operational efficiency) to political objectives (i.e., job creation). A further test reveals that job creation mediates the relationship between salary cuts and SOE top executives’ political appointments. Moreover, top executive age, as an indicator of political incentive, and media coverage, which reflects external monitoring, weaken the impact of the salary-cut policy on effort redirection between the two career tracks. These findings provide implications for research on agency theory, SOEs, and public policy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies whether investor composition affects the sovereign debt market. We construct a data set of sovereign debt holdings by foreign and domestic bank, nonbank private and official investors for 101 countries across three decades. Compared with other investors, private nonbank investors absorb a disproportionate share of the debt supply, and their demand for emerging market debt is most price responsive. A counterfactual analysis of emerging market sovereigns shows a 10% increase in debt leads to a 5.8% yield increase but an outsized 8.4% increase without nonbank investors. We conclude that sovereigns are vulnerable to the loss of nonbanks. F34, G11, G15, F41</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We draw from the social psychology literature to introduce an alternative conceptualization of executive narcissism—narcissistic admiration and rivalry. In the context of chief executive officers (CEOs) pitching to investors, we theorize how narcissistic CEOs may use distinct behavioral strategies to pursue status, thereby shaping investor sentiment and ultimately affecting investors’ funding decisions. Using Shark Tank data, we find evidence that narcissistic admiration and rivalry are associated with opposing patterns in new venture funding, as shaped by investor sentiment. Specifically, CEO narcissistic admiration is positively associated with new venture funding by increasing investor sentiment, whereas CEO narcissistic rivalry is negatively associated with new venture funding by decreasing investor sentiment. These results highlight the need to separate narcissistic admiration and rivalry in executive narcissism research and illustrate the underlying mechanisms through which executive narcissism shapes organizational outcomes. Overall, this study provides new insights into two pathways of executive narcissism and offers evidence consistent with the idea that executive narcissism matters in entrepreneurial contexts.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.17024 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stock and bond prices of a country move together with increasing country-specific risk. Bonds effectively hedge growth expectation risk when country-specific risk is low, resulting in a negative stock-bond correlation. However, as country-specific risk increases, hedging is less effective because (1) rising domestic prices tend to reduce a country’s growth potential and (2) global growth expectation shocks are more persistent than country-specific ones. Consequently, countries with greater country-specific risk exhibit a relatively positive stock-bond correlation. Equity investments in these countries outperform those with negative relationships by 7%–11% annually. The superior performance is not driven by investing in a fixed set of countries.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmidt, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Yonsei University [Grant 2024-22-0467].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07047 .</content>

    <title>Business Acquisition Disclosures: The Effect of Identifying Intangible Assets on Investors’ Judgments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Disclosures about a business acquisition help investors understand what assets are acquired and how the acquiring company plans to benefit from the transaction. However, in practice, these disclosures exhibit significant variation and often fall short of providing meaningful information to investors. Our experiment provides evidence that separately identifying intangible assets acquired in a business combination (i.e., what was acquired) can compensate for shortcomings in an acquirer’s disclosures about how the transaction will benefit the acquiring firm. An additional experiment indicates that the benefits of separately identifying acquired assets do not extend to tangible assets, suggesting our insights may be unique to intangibles.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: Z.

    <title>The Costs of Ambiguous Information Disclosure: On the Unintended Consequences of Providing Restaurant Hygiene Scores on Platforms in the United States</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Information disclosure on digital platforms is ubiquitous, yet it frequently results in unintended consequences, given the prevalence of simplified cues prone to ambiguity in digital platforms’ information design. We study how the addition of hygiene inspection scores, in the form of simplified information disclosure, to restaurant webpages on Yelp across the United States affects restaurant demand. We find that showing high (clean) hygiene scores on Yelp paradoxically reduces restaurant demand relative to restaurants for which Yelp does not show hygiene scores on their Yelp pages. We argue that consumers conflate online hygiene scores with the healthiness and tastiness of the food, thus intuitively leading to reduced demand. Our results reveal that ambiguity is the primary cause of misperceptions about hygiene scores. We also show that providing simple clarifications about the correct meaning of hygiene scores, as well as tweaking the displayed hygiene information to resolve ambiguity, helps mitigate consumer misperceptions. Our research informs practice on how valuable information can be presented online effectively in such a way as to reduce ambiguity, especially on social media platforms. We provide managerial implications for platforms such as Yelp and city municipal authorities that would like to disclose key information online.</content>

    <title>Pareto Improvements in the Contest for College Admissions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many countries base college admissions on a centrally-administered test. Students invest a great deal of resources to improve their performance on the test, and there is growing concern about the high costs associated with these activities. We consider modifying the test by introducing performance-disclosure policies that pool intervals of performance rankings. Pooling affects the equilibrium allocation of students to colleges, which hurts some students and benefits others, but also affects students’ effort. We investigate how such policies can improve students’ welfare in a Pareto sense, study the Pareto frontier of pooling policies, and identify improvements that are robust to the distribution of college seats.We illustrate the potential applicability of our results with an empirical estimation that uses data on college admissions in Turkey. We find that a policy that pools a large fraction of the lowest performing students leads to a Pareto improvement in a contest based on the estimated parameters. A laboratory experiment based on the estimated parameters generally supports our theoretical predictions.</content>

    <title>Industry Tournament Incentives and the U.S. Financial Systemic Risk</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by Coles, Li, and Wang (2020)’s prediction that industry tournament incentives are linked to heightened risk-seeking behavior, we examine whether these incentives contribute positively to systemic risk. Using a measure of systemic risk that captures the cross-sectional tail-dependency between the U.S. financial system and individual financial institutions, we find that the external pay gap is positively related to an institution’s contribution to systemic risk. Consistent with our expectation, industry tournament incentives are positively associated with individual financial institutions’ stock return volatility, Value at Risk, and crash risk, thus indirectly contributing to systemic risk due to financial institutions’ inherent interconnectedness. More interestingly, the external pay gap is positively related to an institution’s financial industry beta and encourages systemically risky activities, suggesting an important impact channel through institutions’ undertaking correlated activities.</content>

    <title>Bank Compensation for the Penalty-Free Loan Prepayment Option: Theory and Evidence</title>
    <updated>2025-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While it is standard for corporate bonds to include a loan cancellation fee, a surprising 90% of tranche A commercial and industrial term loans allow borrowers to prepay the loan without penalty. We use a simple framework with dynamic learning to derive testable implications for the required bank compensation when including a penalty-free prepayment option. In this framework, after loan origination, borrowers receive noncontractible public information about the value of the project funded by the bank loan. This information causes some ex post high-value borrowers to prepay or renegotiate the loan to obtain a lower rate, deteriorating the credit quality of the bank’s remaining borrower pool. To avoid credit rationing of borrowers with a high prepayment risk, we show that the bank’s compensation must be in the form of an upfront fee rather than a higher initial loan rate, as the latter only exacerbates the adverse prepayment incentive. The model also accounts for the possibility that in relationship lending, an upfront fee may dominate a loan cancellation fee when the latter triggers costly ex post bargaining with high-value clients. To test model predictions, we construct a prepayment risk index, which contains proxies for borrower upside potential and loan renegotiation costs, and we use aggregate industry-level merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity as an instrument for exogenous variation in loan prepayment risk. The tests support that upfront fees increase with borrower prepayment risk. In addition, upfront fees are lower for credit lines and loans with performance-sensitive pricing, as predicted.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Funding: Partial financial support from Tuck’s Lindenauer Forum for Corporate Governance (Eckbo) and from the Norwegian Research Council [Grant 273678] (Thorburn and Su) is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00159 .</content>

    <title>Contextual Learning with Online Convex Optimization: Theory and Application to Medical Decision-Making</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Optimizing the treatment regimen is a fundamental medical decision-making problem. This can be thought of as a two-dimensional decision-making problem with a nested structure because it involves determining both the optimal medication and its optimal dose. Identifying the most effective medication for an individual often poses considerable difficulty, and even when a suitable medication is ascertained, dosing it optimally remains a significant challenge. Making these two nested decisions necessitates the adaptive learning of a personalized disease progression control model. To address this problem, we propose a novel contextual multiarmed bandit model under a two-dimensional control with a nested structure. For this model, we develop a new joint contextual learning and optimization algorithm, termed the stochastic subgradient descent atop contextual multiarmed bandit (SGD-MAB) algorithm. It sequentially selects for a patient (i) the best medication based on their contextual information and (ii) the corresponding dose optimized over the prior history of those patients who received the same medication. We prove that it admits a sublinear regret, which is tight up to a logarithmic factor. Our regret analysis leverages the strengths of both contextual bandit approaches and online convex optimization techniques in a seamless fashion. We substantiate the practicality of SGD-MAB using clinical data on patients with hypertension and heightened cardiovascular risks. Our analysis indicates that SGD-MAB has the potential to surpass current practices. We benchmark several policies to show the advantages of our approach and offer critical insights. Our framework holds promise for various applications beyond healthcare that require nested decision-making.This paper was accepted by J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A growing body of literature highlights that large-scale investments in sensitive contexts can undermine both firm financial performance and peace-positive development. We investigate whether and under what conditions foreign direct investment (FDI) proximate to Indigenous land claims increases or decreases conflict. Drawing on social movement theory’s identification of powerful frames and political opportunity structures as drivers of mobilization, we predict that FDI proximate to Indigenous land claims will promote conflict. We leverage novel data on the global location of Indigenous land claims and a global corpus of more than 4 billion news articles. We find that when locations with Indigenous land claims are treated with FDI, we observe an increase in media-reported armed conflict events. We further argue and find this effect to be driven by rebels acting on behalf of Indigenous people who target (multinational) corporations and the governments who offer them the formal license to operate. These negative effects are found across a wide range of industries. Our results underscore that for investments in sensitive socio-political contexts, such as Indigenous lands, firm performance and the livelihoods of community members are heavily influenced by conflict risk mitigation efforts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractRansomware attacks have emerged as one of the biggest threats to cybersecurity. Faced with business disruptions, many organizations accede to ransom demands, and in doing so, they embolden the attackers to launch more attacks, elevating the chance of a future breach for others. We study this externality using a multiperiod game among multiple firms, each of which has a choice to pay or not pay if breached in a particular period, its action having implications for future periods. How should a policymaker intervene to mitigate this externality, and is prohibition necessary? What might work or how it might work as a policy tool depends critically on the behavior of the attacker (extortionist). If the attacker is not strategic, fiscal interventions could work, and a complete prohibition on ransom payment is unnecessary. If the attackers are strategic, though, they may respond to the policymaker’s tax/subsidy in a manner that could increase victims’ propensity to pay, rendering fiscal intervention ineffective as a policy lever. In such a case, prohibition may be the only way to mitigate the externality. Overall, our analysis provides a framework for comparing different types of policy interventions and raises concerns for policymakers and social planners to pause and ponder.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study reveals how incumbent actors leverage physical place as a source of differentiation in response to the threat of digital commoditization. Through a longitudinal, qualitative analysis of the U.S. independent bookselling industry from 1995 to 2019, we outline how dispersed organizational actors responded to the rise of Amazon.com, an online retailer that threatened to displace brick-and-mortar retail. While many analysts predicted that Amazon’s emergence would incite a retail apocalypse, independent bookstores proved to be far more resilient than expected. We identify organizational emplacement—a process by which actors infuse meaning into physicalspaces, thereby transforming them into valuableplaces—as a novel mechanism of value creation. Several practices are associated with this mechanism, including architecting the physical environment, anchoring to the local community, and sanctifying the meaning of place. This study offers a counterbalance to narratives of digital displacement and shows how physical place can be converted from a liability into an asset in the digital era.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The view that a business unit can better compete against product-market rivals if granted funding from its parent firm’s internal capital market (ICM) has lost traction within strategy, despite conflicting evidence. We develop a theory to explain when funding from a parent firm’s ICM should enable a business unit to more effectively capture value (i.e., profit) from its investment opportunities under product-market competition. We depart from prior theories by examining how opportunities relate to competition. Specifically, we propose a typology of opportunities along two strategic dimensions. The first dimension is firm-specificity, a concept derived from the resource-based view. It refers to whether an opportunity stems from unique firm resources and capabilities and is therefore exclusive to a business unit rather than shared with (and contestable by) its product-market rivals. The second dimension is uncertainty about the investment path, a concept derived from the literature on investment under uncertainty and real options. When present, it is impossible (and undesirable) to commit upfront to a fully predetermined set of investments in an opportunity. These dimensions imply that different opportunities may have distinct critical needs in terms of funding—such as secrecy, timeliness, and reliability—that must be satisfied for a business unit to capture value. Ultimately, our theory indicates that receiving funding from a parent firm’s ICM increases a business unit’s chances of capturing value when those critical needs are present, suggesting that units with ICM funding may prevail in some competitive environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop anex antemeasure of commercial potential of science, an otherwise unobservable variable driving the performance of innovation‐intensive firms. To do so, we rely on large language models and neural networks to predict whether scientific articles will influence firms' use of science. Incorporating time‐varying models and the quantification of uncertainty, the measure is validated through both traditional methods and out‐of‐sample exercises, leveraging a major university's technology transfer data. To illustrate the methodological contributions of our measure, we apply it to examining the impact of university reputation and university privatization of science, finding that firms' reliance on reputation may lead to foregone opportunities, and privatization (i.e., patenting) appears to increase firms' use of the science of one university. We make our measure and method available to researchers.Managerial SummaryUsing machine learning, we develop a measure that estimates the probability that a scientific discovery will contribute to a commercially valuable innovation. This work addresses a key challenge: the inability to observe what scientific discoveries are worth pushing forward into commercial application. We illustrate the usefulness of this measure with two examples: 1.) firms’ use of research from prestigious universities over equally promising work from less prominent ones; and 2.) how patenting affects the diffusion of commercially relevant science across firms. For practitioners, this measure can inform R&amp;D, licensing, and other innovation related decisions by guiding firms’ search for commercially relevant scientific research. The measure and the associated code are publicly available.</content>

    <title>How Ideologically Opposed Stakeholders Influence Organizational Practice Adoption: Theory and Evidence from the Diffusion of Domestic Partner Benefits in Higher Education</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the concept of ideologically opposed stakeholders and its implications for the adoption and justification of contentious organizational practices. When organizations face stakeholders who oppose the ideological content of a new organizational practice, we theorize that this opposition causes organizations to emulate prior adopters whose animating values resonate with these opposed stakeholders. We further argue that if they adopt the practice that their stakeholders oppose, such organizations will be more apt to rhetorically justify the practice in a way that resonates with those opposed stakeholders’ values. Using the adoption of same-sex domestic partner benefits among U.S. public universities as our empirical setting, we find support for these ideas. When universities have conservative state policymakers (a key opposed stakeholder), this reality amplifies the university’s emulation of proximally headquartered for-profit corporations and at the same time, weakens their emulation of other universities in their intercollegiate sports network. Universities facing conservative policymakers are also more likely to issue market-based (as opposed to social equity-based) justifications when announcing domestic partner benefits adoption. These findings contribute to organizational research on diffusion, political ideology, stakeholders, and nonmarket strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.17219 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The signature transform is a powerful tool for feature extraction in time series analysis, yet its statistical properties remain underexplored. In their paper in Operations Research, Guo et al. examine the consistency of signature when used with Lasso regression. The study establishes conditions under which Lasso achieves consistent feature selection, both asymptotically and in finite samples. A key finding is that the Itô signature performs better for processes resembling Brownian motion, whereas the Stratonovich signature is more effective for mean-reverting processes. The authors further demonstrate the practical relevance of their results by applying signature-based Lasso regression to option pricing, highlighting its potential in financial modeling. These insights provide a crucial theoretical foundation for improving predictive performance across various domains, including operations research and machine learning.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Marketing Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of a ban on unsolicited store flyers in seven Dutch municipalities that shifted from an opt-out to an opt-in policy between 2018 and 2020. Despite a 50% drop in flyer distribution, household grocery shopping behavior remained largely unchanged. The findings suggest that reducing flyer waste may be possible without substantially disrupting shopping behavior.</content>

    <title>Leveraging Expert Consistency to Improve Algorithmic Decision Support</title>
    <updated>2025-05-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to support high-stakes decisions. However, there is frequently a construct gap: a gap between the construct of interest to the decision-making task and what is captured in proxies used as labels to train ML models. As a result, ML models may fail to capture important dimensions of decision criteria, hampering their utility for decision support. Thus, an essential step in the design of ML systems for decision support is selecting a target label among available proxies. In this work, we explore the use of historical expert decisions as a rich—yet also imperfect—source of information that can be combined with observed outcomes to narrow the construct gap. We argue that managers and system designers may be interested in learning from experts in instances where they exhibit consistency with each other while learning from observed outcomes otherwise. We develop a methodology to enable this goal using information that is commonly available in organizational information systems. This involves two core steps. First, we propose an influence function-based methodology to estimate expert consistency indirectly when each case in the data are assessed by a single expert. Second, we introduce a label amalgamation approach that allows ML models to simultaneously learn from expert decisions and observed outcomes. Our empirical evaluation, using simulations in a clinical setting and real-world data from the child welfare domain, indicates that the proposed approach successfully narrows the construct gap, yielding better predictive performance than learning from either observed outcomes or expert decisions alone.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [Grant R01NS124642], Good Systems, University of Texas at Austin, the Metro 21 Institute, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [Grant FA8750-17-2-0130], the National Science Foundation [Grant 1939606], Google [Award for Inclusion Research], and the UK Medical Research Council [Grants MC UU 00002/2, MC UU 00002/5, and MC UU 00040/02–Precision Medicine].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01576 .</content>

    <title>Lost in the Crowd: How Group Size and Content Moderation Shape User Engagement in Live Streaming</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Live streaming platforms such as Twitch and YouTube Live now play a central role in digital engagement, offering real-time interaction that grows increasingly complex with larger audiences. Our study leverages the exogenous viewer influx from Twitch’s Raid function to examine how increases in group size affect user engagement. Analyzing chat histories from more than 7,000 playbacks using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that although attracting more viewers, larger group sizes also lead to reduced engagement among existing participants. This decline is linked to increased topic incoherence and heightened emotional volatility—or comment polarity—in live chats. Importantly, our results highlight that targeted moderation strategies can mitigate these negative effects. Bot moderators are particularly effective in maintaining coherence during large-scale raids, whereas human moderators better manage emotional surges when the incoming group is smaller. These findings reveal a congestion effect in synchronous digital environments and offer clear practice- and policy-oriented implications: Online synchronous platforms should consider the scalability of viewers and commenters and use flexible moderation strategies to sustain user engagement and foster healthier, more constructive real-time interactions.</content>

    <title>Learning by helping: Evidence from Chinese brokerages' community &lt;scp&gt;CSR&lt;/scp&gt;</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose that firms engaging in community corporate social responsibility (CSR) can acquire valuable local knowledge that improves their core operations. We test our proposition leveraging a unique context‐the Securities Association of China's pairing assistance scheme under the country's targeted poverty alleviation program. Under this scheme, financial brokerage houses conducted community CSR in quasi‐randomly matched impoverished regions. We find support for the local knowledge learning effect of CSR by showing how community CSR participation enabled brokerages to more accurately forecast the earnings of companies in those regions. We complement our quantitative analyses with qualitative data from in‐depth interviews, surveys of brokerage employees, and archival documents. The evidence indicates that forecast accuracy improved when CSR engagements enhanced learning about local companies' capabilities and business environment.Managerial SummaryMany firms engage in community CSR, leveraging their expertise to address issues beyond the capacity of governments and public organizations. Firms can benefit from these CSR efforts, often experiencing performance improvements driven by enhanced corporate reputation and stronger stakeholder relationships. Our research highlights an additional, understudied benefit: CSR can serve as a channel for local knowledge acquisition, whereby firms learn by helping. In a unique context where financial brokerage houses participated in community CSR through quasi‐randomized regional matching, we find that community CSR enabled brokerages to more accurately forecast the earnings of companies in those regions. This improvement occurred because brokerages, through community CSR, gained a deeper understanding of local companies' capabilities and business environment.</content>

    <title>A Stationary Mean-Field Equilibrium Model of Irreversible Investment in a Two-Regime Economy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study firms size distribution in a mean-field model of Cournot competition in a commodity market, where price follows an inverse power demand function. Firms face irreversible investment decisions and constant depreciation of production capacity. Output is affected by Gaussian productivity shocks, whose volatility and the price function can shift due to rare macroeconomic events modeled by a two-state Markov chain. Firms aim to maximize expected discounted profits, net of investment and operating costs, based on the long-run stationary price. We establish existence and uniqueness of a stationary mean-field equilibrium and characterize it through a barrier-type investment strategy with endogenous thresholds for each economic regime. A quasi-closed form for the stationary distribution of firms’ states is provided. The model generates Pareto-distributed firm sizes, consistent with empirical industry data. It also shows that downturns raise market concentration and that firm performance depends on depreciation rates and the persistence of economic fluctuations.</content>

    <title>Strategic Residential Location Choice: How Parents Game Priorities in School Matching</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most school choice matching mechanisms employed in theory and practice assume that schools rank students by characteristics that cannot be manipulated. However, parents may have incentives to misstate information used for determining school priorities, such as the proximity of the residential address to a school, particularly when such misrepresentations are difficult to detect or carry minimal penalties. If manipulation of school priorities occurs, the efficiency and fairness of the matching mechanism may be affected. Using official registration data on 330,000 children from the city of Vienna, I demonstrate that such strategic parental behavior occurs and establish lower bounds for its prevalence. Some parents register their child at a different residential address a few months before applying to a school and change the official residential address back to the original address after the child has been successfully enrolled. Migrants and families with lower education levels are less likely to game the system. A survey among 1,300 parents of first graders suggests that this negatively affects parents and children who are sincere.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: The parents survey was funded by the Institute for Markets and Strategy, Vienna University of Economics and Business.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03711 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In algorithm-augmented service contexts where workers have decision authority, they face two decisions about the algorithm: whether to follow its advice and how quickly to do so. The pressure to work quickly increases with the speed of arriving customers. In this paper, we ask the following. How do workers use algorithms to manage system loads? With a laboratory experiment, we find that superior algorithm quality and high system loads increase participants’ willingness to use their algorithm’s advice. Consequently, participants with the superior algorithm make higher-quality recommendations than those with no algorithm (participants with the inferior algorithm make slightly lower-quality recommendations than those without). However, participants do not necessarily speed up by using algorithms’ advice; their throughput times only decrease compared with the no-algorithm baseline when the system load is high and algorithm quality is superior, although participants would benefit from working faster in all treatments. This happens in part because participants in the high-load, superior-algorithm treatment serve customers more quickly than participants in the other treatments, conditional on using the algorithm. Participants in the high-load, superior-algorithm treatment work especially quickly in later periods as they increasingly default to their algorithm’s advice. Our findings show that algorithms can have benefits for both decision quality and speed. Quality benefits come from workers’ decision to use their algorithms’ advice, whereas speed benefits depend on workers’ algorithm use and the time they spend deliberating about their algorithm use. Ultimately, algorithm quality and system load are mutually reinforcing factors that influence both service quality and especially speed.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01989 .</content>

    <title>Strange Dance Partners: Supply Chain Cyberattacks and Chained Vulnerability</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The concept of “chained vulnerability” addresses the cyberattack risks for organizations through interconnected internal and external actors (e.g., employees and suppliers). As organizational defenses and tactics of antagonistic actors (e.g., hackers) adapt to emerging conditions, certain actors of organizations become compromised as entry points into the targeted organizations. A disruption (i.e., COVID‐19) induces operational changes (i.e., digital transformation), and we study the co‐evolution of attacks and defenses as if the antagonistic actors, organizations, and their internal and external actors are engaged in a dance together. Building on routine activity theory, our study theorizes the adaptive target suitability where the properties of actors, the types of actors involved, and the consequential phases co‐evolve following the disruption. We leverage the COVID‐19 pandemic as the empirical context and use a novel dataset of 3497 publicly reported cyber breaches. Analyses reveal that cyberattacks initially focused on internal actors (i.e., deception‐based attacks on employees) and then shifted to external actors (i.e., system vulnerability‐based attacks on digital infrastructure providers and product suppliers). Semi‐structured interviews with experts (e.g., hackers and cybersecurity managers) and subsequent econometric analyses elucidate how strategic interactions between dance partners lead to disruptions that dynamically reshape the landscape of chained vulnerability.</content>

    <title>Short-Term Fulfillment: How Supervisors’ Motives for Abusive Behaviors Influence Need Satisfaction and Daily Outcomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing research assumes that supervisors invariably feel bad after engaging in abusive behaviors. We challenge this assumption by proposing that supervisors’ motives of abusive supervision shape their post-abuse experiences. Drawing on the social interactionist theory of aggression and theories of self-regulation, we suggest that instrumental (or goal-driven) abusive behaviors provide a temporary sense of fulfillment, whereas spontaneous (or reactive, emotionally-driven) abusive behaviors diminish need satisfaction and foster negative outcomes. Using an exploratory study and an event-contingent experiencing sampling study, we found that supervisors may justify their abuse with effecting compliance motives when subordinates perform poorly, which fulfills task achievement needs and increases next-day work engagement. Similarly, supervisors may also justify their abuse with identity maintenance motives when subordinates are disrespectful, thus enhancing social identity needs and next-day organizational-based self-esteem. We also found that when supervisors justify their abusive behaviors with spontaneous motives (i.e., depletion and negative affect), it has negative implications for need satisfaction and outcomes. Lastly, we highlight supervisor’s psychological power as a boundary condition of these effects. All told, our findings indicate that, at the within-person level, supervisors’ daily motives for abusive behaviors matter, given that certain motives actually yield short-term benefits for supervisors.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Voice AI on Digital Commerce</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research examines the impact of voice-activated shopping assistants, such as Alibaba’s Tmall Genie, on consumer behavior in online shopping. Analyzing real-world purchase data using econometric models, this work finds that the average consumer’s weekly spending on Alibaba increased by 16.6% within the first four months after adopting voice AI. Additionally, we explore specific product features that moderate the effect of Genie adoption by examining the repeat purchase and product substitutability and familiarity, supporting a mechanism that involves reducing information acquisition costs. The positive effects of Genie adoption remain significant on repeat purchases in the long term, although they attenuate over time. Furthermore, our analyses reveal that on average, the voice channel has a positive spillover effect on spending on the PC channel but no significant effect on the mobile channel. The channel dynamics are contingent on specific shopping contexts. These results demonstrate that voice AI devices with shopping capabilities can enhance the growth of the affiliated e-commerce platform. As the first study to empirically examine the impact of voice AI adoption on e-commerce consumption, our paper provides valuable implications for e-commerce platforms and retailers leveraging voice-activated shopping.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Rankings often create tiered status hierarchies—for example, top, middle, and lower status tiers—of the ranked organizations. We study how an organization's position within a tier, particularly near tier boundaries, influences its competitive behavior. We propose atier‐aspiration effect, where those at the top of a lower tier pursue more and riskier competitive actions to advance to the higher tier, and atier‐maintenance effect, where those at the bottom a tier engage in more and riskier competitive actions to maintain their position when there is a greater threat from competitors at the top of the neighboring lower tier. Empirical analyses of Korean business groups' rankings and acquisitions between 2001 and 2018 support these predictions, revealing how positional differences shape competitive actions within tiered status hierarchies.Managerial SummaryRankings often group organizations into tiers—like top, middle, and lower tiers—but not all companies within a tier behave the same. We analyze acquisitions of Korean business groups ranked in an asset‐based ranking and find that firms near the top or bottom of a tier act more competitively than those in the middle. More specifically, those at the top of a lower tier tend to engage in greater and more unrelated acquisitions to move up to a higher tier. Meanwhile, those just above a tier cut‐off engage in greater and more unrelated acquisitions to retain their tier position, especially if they face strong competition from below. These insights can help managers better understand how rankings drive competitive behavior, beyond economic motivations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide novel evidence that aggregate investor attention to stocks predicts marketwide returns, but with a striking difference across investor clienteles. Daily aggregate retail attention (ARA) negatively predicts one-week-ahead market returns, is associated with aggregate retail order imbalance and flows to equity mutual funds, and exhibits a stronger predictability during periods of high marketwide uncertainty, poor liquidity, or more costly short selling. In contrast, aggregate institutional attention (AIA), when observed before major news announcements, positively predict future marketwide returns. In cross-sectional analysis, we show that the predictability is stronger for ARA among illiquid stocks and for AIA among high-beta stocks. The predictability results are robust out-of-sample and correspond to meaningful expected utility gains even for diversified investors. The findings are consistent with the idea that attention-driven retail buying can generate an aggregate price pressure on the stock market, whereas institutional attention precedes the resolution of marketwide uncertainty and the accrual of risk premiums.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Funding: J.

    <title>Beyond IID: Data-Driven Decision Making in Heterogeneous Environments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How should one leverage historical data when past observations are not perfectly indicative of the future, for example, because of the presence of unobserved confounders which one cannot “correct” for? Motivated by this question, we study a data-driven decision-making framework in which historical samples are generated from unknown and different distributions assumed to lie in a heterogeneity ball with known radius and centered around the (also) unknown future (out-of-sample) distribution on which the performance of a decision will be evaluated. This work aims to analyze the performance of central data-driven policies and also near-optimal ones in these heterogeneous environments, and it aims to understand key drivers of performance. We establish a first result that allows us to upper bound the asymptotic worst-case regret of a broad class of policies. Leveraging this result, for any integral probability metric, we provide a general analysis of the performance achieved by sample average approximation (SAA) as a function of the radius of the heterogeneity ball. This analysis is centered around the approximation parameter, a notion of complexity we introduce to capture how the interplay between the heterogeneity and the problem structure impacts the performance of SAA. In turn, we illustrate, through several widely studied problems—for example, newsvendor, pricing—how this methodology can be applied and find that the performance of SAA varies considerably depending on the combinations of problem classes and heterogeneity. The failure of SAA for certain instances motivates the design of alternative policies to achieve rate optimality. We derive problem-dependent policies achieving strong guarantees for the illustrative problems described above and provide initial results toward a principled approach for the design and analysis of general rate-optimal algorithms.This paper was accepted by Vivek Farias, data science.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03448 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a general simulation-based procedure for estimating the quality of approximate policies in heterogeneous-agent equilibrium models, which allows us to verify that such approximate solutions describe a near-rational equilibrium. Our procedure endows agents with superior knowledge of the future path of the economy, while imposing a suitable penalty for such foresight. The relaxed problem is more tractable than the original, and results in an upper bound on agents’ welfare. Our method applies to various solution algorithms. We illustrate our approach in two applications: the incomplete-markets model of Krusell and Smith (1998) and the heterogeneous firm model of Khan and Thomas (2008).

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Markdown Policies for Demand Learning with Forward-Looking CustomersDemand uncertainty and forward-looking customer behavior pose substantial challenges for sellers. In “Markdown policies for demand learning with forward-looking customers,” Birge, Chen, and Keskin analyze a markdown pricing problem involving demand model uncertainty and strategic customers. The authors identify that strategic customer behavior creates a strong intertemporal dependence, where early markdowns influence later demand outcomes. They characterize the impact of this intertemporal dependence on demand learning and develop near-optimal policies that judiciously delay markdowns to manage forward-looking customer behavior while ensuring efficient learning.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;ORLM: Pioneering Open-Source Framework for Automated Optimization ModelingA study titled "ORLM: A Customizable Framework in Training Large Models for Automated Optimization Modeling" has been published, introducing the first open-source framework designed to automate optimization modeling using large language models (LLMs). This innovative approach addresses critical challenges in the field of operations research (OR), particularly the overreliance on closed-source LLMs like GPT-4, which raises privacy concerns and limits customization in industrial applications.The research team proposed OR-Instruct, a semiautomated data synthesis framework that generates high-quality training data tailored to specific optimization modeling requirements. They also introduced IndustryOR, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs’ performance on real-world OR problems. By training several 7B-scale open-source LLMs with the synthesized data, the team achieved state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, including NL4Opt, MAMO, and IndustryOR.This advancement not only enhances the accessibility and applicability of optimization modeling, but also paves the way for more efficient and privacy-conscious solutions in various industrial sectors. The ORLM framework exemplifies the potential of open-source initiatives in driving innovation and democratizing advanced analytical tools for operations research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that public charities with corporate directors on their boards are more likely to lobby on behalf of connected corporate interests. We document this result using granular fixed effects and alternative measures, excluding donor firms, focusing on specific legislation bills, and shocks to board connections. The effects of connections are stronger when firms face more competition, have better corporate governance, and are more exposed to political risks. Through connected charity lobbying, firms enjoy political benefits in the form of governmental procurement contracts. Policies aimed at improving the transparency of nonprofits help discipline charities who would otherwise seek funding benefits through procorporate lobbying activities. Our results highlight directors’ charitable engagement as a complementary avenue for corporate political activities.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00165 .</content>

    <title>Is Relevancy Everything? A Deep-Learning Approach to Understand the Effect of Image-Text Congruence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms increasingly use a combination of image and text description when displaying products and engaging consumers. Existing research has examined consumers’ response to text and image stimuli separately but has yet to systematically consider how the semantic relationship between image and text impacts consumer choice. In this research, we conduct a series of multimethod empirical studies to examine the congruence between image- and text-based product representation. First, we propose a deep-learning approach to measure image-text congruence by building a state-of-the-art two-branch neural network model based on wide residual networks and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers. Next, we apply our method to data from an online reading platform and discover a U-shaped effect of image-text congruence: Consumers’ preference toward a product is higher when the congruence between the image and text representation is either high or low than when the congruence is at the medium level. We then conduct experiments to establish the causal effect of this finding and explore the underlying mechanisms. We further explore the generalizability of the proposed deep-learning model and our substantive finding in two additional settings. Our research contributes to the literature on consumer information processing and generates managerial implications for practitioners on how to strategically pair images and text on digital platforms.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Funding: J.

    <title>EXPRESS: Sustainable Product Profit Potential and Availability</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers have become more interested in purchasing products produced using more sustainable practices, with much of the recent growth in consumer-packaged goods (CPGs) within the United States from products with clearly labeled sustainability claims on their packaging. However, many categories have low levels of sustainable product market share, with substantial geographic variation. We assess the role of demographic variables on the availability of sustainable products, after controlling for their relative “profit potential” (determined by quantity, price, and price elasticity). To estimate profit potential, we estimate product and county-specific demand elasticities for seven CPG subcategories in the grocery and mass merchandiser formats. A meta-analysis of the estimates show that the relative profit potential of sustainable products increases with income and Democratic vote share. These variables predict greater sustainable product availability than would be expected from their higher profit potential. The fraction of the county that is white does not significantly impact profit potential but leads to higher sustainable product availability. Our findings provide evidence that managers likely use simple demographic heuristics to make product stocking decisions (supported by a separate survey of retailers) that do not necessarily reflect preferences for sustainable products and their profitability.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Dynamic Effects of TV Ad Suspension on Keyword Search: Evidence from the U.S. Telecom Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates the dynamic effects of temporarily suspending TV ads on online keyword search through a large-scale quasi-experiment in the U.S. wireless telecom industry. One top carrier, which spends stably around one million USD per day on TV advertising, halted its TV ads for a randomly selected week over our (6-month) study window. The primary challenges in this event study — continuously changing treatment variables and establishing valid control groups to account for time-varying confounders—are addressed using the generalized synthetic control estimator (GSC). Findings reveal significant immediate and lasting declines in the focal brand’s search volume, with reductions of 5-15% per day persisting for two weeks after TV ads resumed. The effects varied significantly across search categories: informational searches related to TV ad content experienced drops of up to 30% per day but recovered more quickly, while navigational searches showed smaller but more prolonged declines. Furthermore, the intervention had modest, short-lived spillover effects on three competitors. Interestingly, the suspension tended to hurt the competitor most similar to the focal brand, while benefiting leading competitors. These spillover effects were particularly pronounced in informational and channel searches, suggesting that competitors’ visibility was significantly affected by the focal brand’s absence.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Automated versus Human Agents: A Meta-Analysis of Customer Responses to Robots, Chatbots, and Algorithms and Their Contingencies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This meta-analysis examines when three types of automated agents (AAs)—robots, chatbots, and algorithms—are equivalent to human agents (HAs) in marketing roles. Analyzing 943 effect sizes from 327 studies provides novel insights. First, customers may be skeptical of AAs; however, they value their performance and eventually choose or buy from them as if they were interacting with HAs. Second, each of the three AA types has a unique set of contingencies that affect its human equivalence; previously identified contingencies do not generalize and can even have opposing effects across AA types. This study also identifies novel contingencies, such as the multifaceted concept of artificial intelligence required to fulfill a task. Third, some contingencies make AAs more humanlike, while others make their machine characteristics salient. These findings enrich the concept of automated social presence (ASP), suggesting that AAs are hybrid beings with a social presence (i.e., the feeling of interacting with a humanlike entity) and an automated presence (i.e., the feeling of interacting with a machine entity). The authors provide recommendations on when AAs can replace HAs in marketing roles to release capacity and alleviate labor shortages. They also suggest a future research agenda.</content>
