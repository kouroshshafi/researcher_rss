    <title>Differential Privacy via Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Privacy-Accuracy Trade-off from an Optimization Lens: Fix a Desired Level of Privacy, Then Maximize AccuracyIn differential privacy, the de facto standard for safeguarding individual information in data analysis, noise is added to statistics to limit the disclosure of sensitive information. Greater privacy requires more noise, creating a trade-off as the added noise reduces the accuracy of the resulting statistics. Historically, researchers have addressed this by restricting themselves to families of noise mechanisms that are sufficient for a predefined privacy level and proving their performance under specific conditions. Selvi, Liu, and Wiesemann propose a novel approach that guarantees optimal accuracy for any specified privacy level. They formulate the design of privacy mechanisms as an optimization problem that minimizes the expected loss associated with the random noise mechanism while encoding differential privacy as constraints. Through detailed analyses and by leveraging tools from distributionally robust optimization, they develop an efficient optimization algorithm and derive implementable solutions with provable guarantees to solve the problem within seconds.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this study, we leverage the transformation of a performance management system that shifts from only providing a performance rating to also providing an explicit assessment of potential. Although performance measures enable organizations to evaluate an employee’s past performance, they provide limited information regarding the employee’s potential to perform in a prospective job that requires a different skill set. Consequently, firms are gradually moving toward the incorporation of explicit potential assessments in their annual appraisal process to evaluate the employee’s promotability to a different task environment. Our data access allows us to provide evidence on the consequences of implementing a performance management system that adopted the explicit assessment of potential. We find that, on average, the performance of promoted employees is lower after implementation, suggesting that the potential assessment system is less effective in identifying candidates suitable for promotion. Additional analyses lead us to conclude that the difficulty of evaluating employee potential reduces performance upon promotion because of inaccurate recommendations of supervisors who do not sufficiently differentiate in their ratings. We thus identify variation in supervisors’ evaluation quality as an important source of the Peter Principle.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02199 .</content>

    <title>An OBSE‐Contingent Work Engagement Model of Felt Trust: Implications for Task Performance and Work‐to‐Home Conflict</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employees respond differently to felt trust from their supervisor. We propose and test an organization‐based self‐esteem (OBSE)‐contingent work engagement model of felt trustthat predicts task performance and work‐to‐home conflict. We argue that employees use OBSE as a lens for interpreting felt trust, which has implications for their work engagement and subsequent task performance and work‐to‐home conflict. In Study 1 (a multi‐wave survey in the USA), we found that employees who had higher (lower) OBSE responded more positively (negatively) to felt trust with higher (lower) work engagement. In Study 2 (a cross‐lagged survey in China), we replicated the findings of Study 1 and further showed that felt trust had a positive (negative) relationship with task performance and a negative (positive) relationship with work‐to‐home conflict via work engagement among higher‐ (lower‐) OBSE employees. Our model shifts the thinking on felt trust and has implications for felt trust theory and managerial practice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digitalization and global disruptions have fundamentally changed how we approach work. Global virtual work has become increasingly widespread in recent years, often replacing or complementing traditional expatriation and international business travel. To advance our understanding of this phenomenon, we systematically reviewed the literature on global virtual work, distinguishing it into three domains: global virtual teams, distributed work, and the use of digital technologies. For each domain, we examined key actors, their objectives, underlying theories, methodologies, and findings. The first domain provides insights into the antecedents, moderators, and mediators of the effectiveness of global virtual teams. The second domain explores individual and organizational research on diverse distributed work arrangements, such as offshoring, global platforms, and global nomads. The third domain addresses the enabling and moderating roles that digital technologies play in facilitating global virtual work. Synthesizing prior research, we developed a multilevel conceptual framework that integrates inputs, processes, and outcomes of global virtual work, offering novel perspectives. We outlined promising opportunities for future research across four themes: people, technology, context, and time. Additionally, we examined the practical implications of our findings for policymakers, managers, and individual workers as they navigate the evolving landscape of global virtual work.</content>

    <title>Artificial Intelligence (AI) Assistant in Online Shopping: A Randomized Field Experiment on a Livestream Selling Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Livestream selling is an innovative form of online shopping that supports real-time interactions between streamers and consumers. However, a key challenge remains: Streamers have limited capacity to answer individual inquiries, whereas shoppers expect fast, personalized responses. This study investigates whether an AI-powered streaming assistant can address this tension by providing interactive, chat-based support to help consumers access and process information. Through a large-scale randomized field experiment on a leading livestream selling platform, we find that the AI assistant increases sales by 3.00% and reduces product return rates by 12.55%. Our analysis suggests that the AI assistant helps consumers feel more informed and confident in their purchases, thereby reducing uncertainty. At the same time, the AI assistant can occasionally disrupt the consumers’ livestream experience. Overall, the benefits of uncertainty reduction outweigh the negative influence of interruptions. For platform managers and policymakers, these findings evidence the potential of AI technology to enhance online commerce. The AI assistant is particularly effective for high-uncertainty products and for streamers with large audiences, offering implications for strategic deployment. Our research provides actionable insights for integrating AI into livestream selling and other digital commerce scenarios where real-time, AI-powered support can facilitate both consumer satisfaction and business growth.</content>

    <title>Timely Cybersecurity Disclosure and Information Manipulation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Regulators have increasingly mandated firms to promptly disclose material cybersecurity incidents upon discovering these incidents. We find suggestive evidence indicating that some firms manipulate the discovery date (“misreport”) of a cybersecurity incident to postpone the disclosure of the incident, as evidenced by a pronounced spike in insider sales before the reported discovery date. We also find that misreporting is more prevalent among firms with weak internal control systems, when firms face low litigation risk, and when firms have greater pressure to meet a disclosure deadline. Further, firms suspected of misreporting tend to disclose their remedial actions and assert the restoration of business, mitigating negative market reactions upon disclosure of incidents. Collectively, our results suggest that firms might strategically misreport information about a cybersecurity incident to delay disclosure to gain additional time for remedial actions, which helps them prevent exposing vulnerabilities to malicious actors and alleviate stakeholder anxiety.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01058 .</content>

    <title>Position Auctions with Endogenous Product Information: Why Live-Streaming Advertising Is Thriving</title>
    <updated>2025-03-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Live-streaming advertising in e-commerce is soaring. Both Amazon and Alibaba have employed this novel marketing model to engage consumers by sequentially exhibiting different products through live-streaming videos. In this paper, we adopt a mechanism design framework to model live-streaming e-commerce as a position auction with endogenous provision of product information. We prove that finding the mechanism that simultaneously optimizes position allocation and information provision is NP-hard. Thus, we develop several approximation algorithms. Building on the connection to the order selection problem, our analysis establishes that heuristics relying solely on product information provision can achieve up to 66.9% of the optimal revenue in the worst case. In contrast, heuristics exploiting position allocation alone may result in arbitrarily large revenue losses. We attribute the efficacy of product information provision to its enhancement of the value of ad spots in position auctions. Our findings suggest that advertising that focuses on differentiating product information—as in live-streaming e-commerce—is more lucrative than conventional position-based sponsored search. This managerial insight remains valid when accommodating multiproduct purchases with dependency or accounting for random consumer attention spans.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72201234, 72192805], the Hong Kong Research Grants Council [Grants 16211619, 16502219, 16212821, 16501722, C6032-21G], and the Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Mathematical Foundations for Artificial Intelligence [Grant 2023B1212010001].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.01299 .</content>

    <title>Do Managers Successfully Shop for Auditors Who Allow Them to Opportunistically Report Positive News? Evidence from Accounting Estimates</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior auditor shopping literature examines managers’ attempts to opportunistically underreport negative news by finding auditors who will allow them to avoid negative audit opinions or underreport goodwill impairments or financial misstatements. We advance this literature by examining management attempts to opportunistically report positive news, as captured by income-increasing changes in accounting estimates. Adapting a previous framework, we find that, ex ante, managers are more (less) likely to dismiss their auditor if it increases (decreases) the expected likelihood of reporting income-increasing changes in accounting estimates (POSCHGs). We also find that, ex post, following auditor dismissals, the frequency and magnitude of POSCHGs increase, and companies reporting POSCHGs are more likely to restate earnings, receive Securities and Exchange Commission comment letters related to estimates, meet or beat earnings targets, and less likely to receive going concern opinions or violate debt covenants. Placebo tests show that none of the above results hold for income-decreasing changes in estimates. Finally, we identify several institutional factors that constrain managers’ ability to shop for lenient auditors, including the quality of the successor auditor and strong corporate governance. Collectively, our findings are consistent with managers successfully shopping for auditors who allow them to opportunistically report positive news following auditor dismissals.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05299 .</content>

    <title>Towards the Integration of Precision Medicine in Psychiatric Care Delivery: Evaluating the Impact of Clinical Guidelines on Drug‐Related Adverse Events</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the immense potential of precision medicine to revolutionize healthcare, its integration into routine clinical practice remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the impact of Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines, which provide synthesized evidence and pharmacogenetics‐based drug dosing recommendations, on the delivery of psychiatric care enabled by precision medicine. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the effect of CPIC guidelines on serious drug‐related adverse events and explore how drug characteristics related to therapeutic uncertainty, namely drug age and drug label warning, moderate this effect. Our findings suggest that the availability of CPIC guidelines is associated with almost a 25% decrease in serious drug‐related adverse events in the context of psychiatric care delivery enabled by precision medicine. Furthermore, we find that the presence of drug label warning, as FDA‐endorsed negative news on pharmacogenetics‐related drug use, enhances the effect of CPIC guidelines and is associated with a further decrease in serious drug‐related adverse events. Post hoc analysis reveals that CPIC guidelines with high strength of evidence are associated with a significant decrease in serious drug‐related adverse events, while no such effect is observed for guidelines with low strength of evidence. These findings contribute to the nascent literature on integrating precision medicine into routine clinical practice, highlighting the consequential role of clinical guidelines in improving the effectiveness of psychiatric care delivery for individual patients enabled by precision medicine. In addition, by demonstrating how the development and implementation of robust clinical guidelines are central to minimizing serious drug‐related adverse events, the findings have policy implications for minimizing the downside risks of psychiatric care delivery.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Theory posits that when managers anticipate excess capacity, averageqbecomes a biased estimator of marginalqas the potential for underutilizing new capital reduces the marginal benefit of investing. After correcting for this source of measurement error, the explanatory power of Tobin'sqsubstantially improves in time‐series and cross‐sectional regressions as well as in out‐of‐sample tests. These findings, together with a secular erosion in capacity utilization, help explain why corporate investment rates have been declining for decades despite averageqincreasing significantly. Our analysis indicates that economic rigidities have contributed to the persistent erosion in capacity utilization.</content>

    <title>Endogenous shaping as an evolutionary process: An empirical demonstration with the photovoltaic cell industry, 1976–2010</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For endogenous shaping to be recognized as an evolutionary process that helps explain the co‐evolution of firms and their environment, theories on shaping need to provide a direct link between the endogenously introduced modifications and the evolutionary trajectory of actors in the industry. Integrating insights from the sensemaking literature into the evolutionary perspective on shaping, we establish this link and identify evolutionary feedback—the response of market actors to endogenous modifications—as a distinct feature in the shaping process. To advance toward more generalized theorizing on the mechanisms of the shaping process, we ground our theoretical insights in a real‐life case by conducting a history‐friendly study of endogenous shaping and evolutionary feedback in the photovoltaic cell industry.Managerial SummaryUnderstanding how firms actively shape their environment is essential for explaining industry evolution. This study highlights the need for theories on shaping to establish a link between shapers' modifications to the industry environment and the evolutionary trajectory of firms. By integrating sensemaking insights into the evolutionary economics perspective on shaping, we provide this link and demonstrate that evolutionary feedback—market actors' responses to endogenous changes—is a distinctive feature of the shaping process. We demonstrate the shaping process and evolutionary feedback in the photovoltaic cell industry. Our findings illustrate how endogenous modifications to the industry environment triggered evolutionary feedback. This research gives managers a deeper understanding of how their strategic decisions can influence evolutionary trajectories, highlighting the importance of evolutionary feedback in this process.</content>

    <title>Delegation of decision rights and capital reallocation: Evidence from &lt;scp&gt;US&lt;/scp&gt; municipalities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the role of organizational structure in influencing internal capital reallocations. Despite the importance of flexible capital reallocation, empirical evidence suggests remarkably high levels of stability in these decisions. Adopting a behavioral perspective, we focus on information processing demands faced by boundedly rational decision‐makers as an antecedent of such decision patterns. We argue, and provide evidence, that centralization of decision rights, which increases information processing demands, results in lower levels of capital reallocations, compared with decentralized structures. Empirically, we explore the causal effect of centralization on reallocation, leveraging an exogenous variation in decision rights among Illinois state municipalities. Additional analyses provide further evidence that a likely mechanism explaining our findings is that of decentralization reducing information processing load on decision‐makers.Managerial SummaryDrawing on data from municipalities in the State of Illinois, we show that the delegation of decision rights for resource allocation leads to a higher reallocation among municipal functions, compared with a centralized decision‐making structure. Organizations often face resource constraints, and they must make trade‐offs when allocating resources to competing projects. In such an environment, resource reallocation process can be paramount to achieving strategic goals. Given that managers have a choice in designing decision‐making arrangements for allocation of resources, they can decide to (de)centralize resource allocation process according to the desirability of reallocation. Our findings indicate that centralization of decision‐making leads to a greater information processing burden faced by managers, affecting the magnitude of resource reallocation.</content>

    <title>“Descended from Immigrants and Revolutionists:” How Family History Shapes Immigration Policymaking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does family history matter for policymaking in democracies? Linking members of Congress to the census, we observe countries of birth for members, their parents, and their grandparents, allowing us to measure ancestry for the politicians in office when U.S. immigration policy changed dramatically, from closing the border in the 1920s to reshaping admittance criteria in the 1960s. We find that legislators descended from immigrant parents or grandparents support more permissive immigration legislation. They are also less likely to speak negatively about immigration in speeches before Congress. A regression discontinuity design analyzing close elections, which addresses district-level selection and holds district composition constant, confirms our results on roll call voting and speech. Efforts to account for selection into immigration—such as comparing international immigrants to domestic migrants and exploiting variation in restrictive legislation targeting specific regions of origin—further confirm the relationship between family immigration experience and more permissive stances on immigration policy. We then explore mechanisms, finding support for in-group identity in connecting family history with policymaking. MCs name their children in ways that express immigrant identity, and immigrant-descended MCs discuss immigration using more personal frames, emphasizing family over economic considerations. Our findings illustrate the important role of personal background in legislative behavior in democratic societies, even on major and controversial topics like immigration, and suggest how experiences transmitted from previous generations can inform lawmakers’ views.</content>

    <title>Reject or Protect? Corrective Action in Response to Women’s vs. Men’s Reports of Workplace Abuse</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations encourage employees to report abusive behavior as such reports are believed to facilitate corrective action against transgressors. However, there are competing perspectives on whether reports made by women (versus men) will facilitate corrective action. On the one hand, a dominant stream of research suggests that reports made by women are often ignored and disregarded because women are not seen as credible. On the other hand, an emerging stream of research suggests that third parties will see reports made by women as serious and important. To reconcile these perspectives, we draw on aversive discrimination theory, which hints that the degree of corroboration about abuse plays a key role. That is, under situations of low corroboration, third parties are unlikely to take corrective action when women (versus men) make reports, but under situations of high corroboration, third parties are equally or even more likely to take corrective action when women (versus men) make reports. We additionally theorize and find that corroboration is particularly influential when the reporter’s general credibility is not established. Our empirical package includes six complementary studies: an archival data set of U.S. Government employees and five preregistered experiments.Funding: For financial assistance, we thank the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [Junior Faculty Development Award].</content>

    <title>Designing AI-Based Work Processes: How the Timing of AI Advice Affects Diagnostic Decision Making</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although clinical artificial intelligence (AI) systems can augment medical diagnosis decisions by providing competent second opinions, how to effectively integrate AI into routine diagnostic processes, such as when to present AI advice to human physicians, remains largely unexplored. Therefore, our research experimentally examines how the timing of AI advice affects diagnostic decision making using a think-aloud approach. Physicians perform medical diagnoses under three conditions: ex post advice (AI advice given after an initial diagnosis), ex ante advice (AI advice given concurrently with clinical information), and a control condition (no AI advice). Our results indicate that the timing of AI advice significantly affects diagnostic accuracy and calibration, with the ex post advice condition yielding the best performance and the control condition the worst. We then conduct several analyses to disentangle the underlying mechanism. We reveal that the superior diagnostic quality in the ex post advice condition can be attributed to more thorough clinical information processing and more active cognitive engagement with AI’s reasoning rationale. As a result, participants in the ex post advice condition are more capable of differentiating correct from incorrect AI advice than those in the ex ante advice condition. Additionally, they benefit more from high-quality AI advice that contradicts their initial diagnoses. To gain additional insights, we estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects based on physician and clinical case characteristics. Our findings underscore the importance of presenting AI advice at appropriate times during routine diagnostic processes to achieve successful decision augmentation with AI advice.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: This work was supported by the National University of Singapore [Grants Dean Strategic Fund - Health Informatics (HIIOT)/E and NSCP/ N-171-000-499-001] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72301279].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01454 .</content>

    <title>Skilled Labor Uncertainty and Corporate Investment: Evidence from H-1B Visa Lottery Cycles</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how periodic uncertainty about skilled labor supply affects corporate investment using the H-1B visa program for skilled workers as an empirical setting. Exploiting cross-regional variation in H-1B labor flows based on historical immigrant enclaves, we find that firms in regions that attract more H-1B workers concentrate their investments in the quarter after uncertainty about visa access is resolved by the H-1B lottery. Consistent with a skilled labor uncertainty channel, we find that the investment spikes are confined to industries where invested capital cannot be easily redeployed, to firms that cannot easily find domestic substitutes for lost H-1B workers, and to firms that cannot easily arrange alternative employment visas for their foreign employees.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: S.-J.

    <title>War as a Phenomenon of Inquiry in Management Studies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We argue that war as a phenomenon deserves more focused attention in management. First, we highlight why war is an important and relevant area of inquiry for management scholars. We then integrate scattered conversations on war in management studies into a framework structured around three building blocks – (a) the nature of war from an organizational viewpoint, (b) the actors involved in war and (c) war's contextual factors. This framework provides a roadmap to identify pressing questions that management scholars can address, thus laying the foundations of a programmatic theory for analysing war as a specific area of inquiry. We especially emphasize the recursive relationship between war and management theory, demonstrating how they can mutually inform each other. Finally, we highlight empirical challenges and offer specific recommendations to guide future management research on war. Aiming to stimulate a new scholarly conversation, this paper contributes to establishing a forward‐looking research agenda that can help management scholars problematize key issues in the analysis of war.</content>

    <title>Confronting the Climate Crisis: Fossil Fuel Hegemony and the Need for Decarbonization, Degrowth, and Democracy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this Counterpoint, we argue for the importance of social movements in responding to the climate crisis by challenging the taken‐for‐granted practices and policies of corporate capitalism. These challenges politicize what is seen as ‘common sense’ and show that there are alternatives to the dominant social order of fossil‐fuelled economic growth. More specifically, we set out three ways to minimise future harm and suffering by discussing (i) the required decarbonisation of the economic system, (ii) the eventual degrowth needed to address the existing crisis and avoiding the creation of another, and (iii) the strengthening of democracy essential to breaking fossil fuel dependence. Challenges to corporate capitalism are often accused of being naïve and unrealistic, but responding to climate change demands an epochal rethink of what should be seen as ‘sensible’.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite increasing attention to alternative market systems, where consumers perform considerable voluntary labor, consumer researchers have a limited understanding of the nature or implications of the emotion work entailed in making such contributions. This paper addresses this gap, focusing on “committed consumers” defined as those who provide extensive volunteer labor to support alternative markets and their principles. It does so based on hermeneutic analysis of ethnographic and netnographic data collected from participants in local food markets (REKO markets) in Norway. The paper identifies four distinct types of institutional emotion work that contribute to perpetuating alternative markets and conceptualizes how committed consumers' own emotions are affected when making such contributions. This paper extends our understanding of consumers' roles in alternative market systems and of the socially constituted and constitutive emotions entailed in consumer volunteerism.</content>

    <title>Strategic Scientific Disclosure: Evidence from the Leahy–Smith America Invents Act</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of technological competition on voluntary innovation disclosure around the enactment of the Leahy–Smith America Invents Act of 2011 (“AIA”). The AIA moves the US patent system from the first‐to‐invent to first‐inventor‐to‐file system and induces a patent race that increases technological competition. Firms that are slow to file a patent are disadvantaged in this race. We find that focal firms with lagging patent classes strategically increase scientific publications in their lagging technology areas in an attempt to block competitors from obtaining a patent. This effect is more pronounced in technology areas where the firm has better information about their relative competitive position (proxied by greater inventor mobility), in technology classes with constraints on increasing patent filing timeliness (proxied by fewer experienced attorneys), and areas characterized by more intense competition. We find that the peers of firms with lagging classes experience greater patent filing rejections for lack of novelty and obviousness reasons after the AIA, suggesting that strategic scientific disclosure is effective.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Researchers constantly face challenging new phenomena that warrant study. Although we do a remarkable job of studying these phenomena, we continue to miss a big opportunity to learn from these findings in ways that can help future work. This article calls for researchers to re-think common major research processes to abstract principles that can lead to more cumulative knowledge. Specifically, this paper suggests change related to four research activities—defining the problem, anchoring to prior research, seeking novelty, and reporting practices.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper contributes to sustainable HRM theory, policy, and practice by applying and extending systems theory. A framing is developed and applied by triangulating data from 85 interviews with workers, managers, and other stakeholders (e.g., unions, employer representatives, charities) in adult social care, along with qualitative and quantitative secondary data sources. The findings highlight three main (un)sustainable HRM challenges shaped by inconsistencies between employment in the public and independent sectors:constrained system resources,disconnected career structures, anduneven voice patterns. The article contributes to HR theory by re‐framing “(un)sustainable HRM” to include how actors are constrained and/or supported by multi‐level relationships between systems and sub‐systems. The research advances policy and practice by proposing how more sustainable HRM approaches could be implemented.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Destructive entrepreneurship is an important research topic because it challenges the frequent implicit assumption that all entrepreneurship is “good.” Recent scholarly interest has been directed toward destructive entrepreneurship from various perspectives, including economics, psychology, and business ethics. This article offers a comprehensive review of the literature on destructive entrepreneurship. We begin with a definition of destructive entrepreneurship, distinguishing it from seemingly similar constructs, such as unproductive entrepreneurship. We organize the fragmented studies into a multilevel model highlighting what we know about destructive entrepreneurship. This study also reveals potential holes in this framework that future research can fill.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conducted a three-step replication of Davidsson and Honig’s study on the roles of human and social capital in venture creation processes. First, we attempted an exact replication to rule out mistakes and questionable manipulations influencing the original results. Second, we included the initial stage of development as an additional control variable, reflecting on updates suggested in later research. Third, we extended the original analyses using a sample from a different spatiotemporal context, enhancing theoretical generalizability. We largely validate D&amp;H’s findings, highlight the importance of modeling initial entrepreneurial processes, and emphasize the underappreciated complexities and value of replication studies.</content>

    <title>Systemizing Entrepreneurial Metacognition: Thinking About the Past and Future</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This review of the entrepreneurial metacognition literature systematizes the existing literature. Metacognition is vital for entrepreneurs to sense, act, and mobilize cognitive resources under uncertainty. Despite the rapidly growing stream of metacognitive research in entrepreneurship, indicating that the topic is promising and emerging, these bits of knowledge still need to be brought together to provide a big picture of where we have been to explore where we can go. Our review addresses this need by analyzing the literature on entrepreneurial metacognition. We define entrepreneurial metacognition as the mental activities of generating self-awareness and monitoring and controlling one’s cognition about identifying potential opportunities, creating a new venture, and/or managing a new venture. The inductive results reveal five attributes that reflect the essence of entrepreneurial metacognition: (a) adaptive cognition, (b) metaheuristics, (c) self-regulated cognition, (d) cultural adaptation, and (e) metacompetencies. We address definitional issues and empirical patterns, synthesize the attributes of entrepreneurial metacognition, and present a model that links entrepreneurial metacognition’s antecedents and outcomes to advance future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why do migrants return home and start businesses? Research on this multistage phenomenon—that is, return followed by entrepreneurship—is fragmented, reflecting different scholarly approaches and reasons migrants return and start businesses (or not). We systematically review 80 papers addressing aspects of returnee entrepreneurship and organize findings into a two-stage process model grounded in three levels of analysis—institutional, social, and individual. Our model contributes by providing a parsimonious way to understand returnee entrepreneurship and describe what has been learned. We also contribute a research agenda to help entrepreneurship scholars leverage what is known about entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial processes to address critical unanswered questions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How new family CEOs use the structural setup they initially find to foster post-succession change in their family firms remains a theoretical and practical puzzle. Building on strategic change and family succession insights, we draw upon 74 interviews from 43 intra-family CEO successions to employ a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. We reveal three change-enabling solutions (authority, empowerment, and alignment) and develop a model of how new family CEOs navigate different structural setups. We add configurational insights to strategic change research in entrepreneurial organizations such as family firms, extend knowledge on new CEO power, and provide contingency factors to the role of new CEO distance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As threats to democracy endanger the rights and freedoms of people around the world, scholars are increasingly interrogating the role that organizations play in shaping democratic and authoritarian societies. Just as societies can be more or less democratic, so, too, can organizations. This essay, in honor ofASQ’s 70th volume, argues for a deeper focus in organizational research on the extent to which organizations themselves are democratic and the outcomes associated with these varied models of organizing. First, we provide a framework for considering the extent to which organizations are democratically organized, accounting for the varied ways in which workers can participate in their organizations. Second, we call for research on the outcomes associated with democratic organizing at both the organizational and societal levels. We build from research arguing that the extent to which workers participate in organizational decision making can spill over to impact their expectations of and participation in civic life. Moving forward, we argue it is critical to recognize that questions of democracy and authoritarianism concern not only the political contexts in which organizations are embedded but also how organizations themselves are structured and contribute to society.</content>

    <title>In Safe Hands: The Financial and Real Impact of Investor Composition over the Credit Cycle</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I show that investor composition affects bond price dynamics and capital allocation during crises. Using large-scale holdings data and within-firm ownership variation across near-identical bonds, I causally identify bond returns’ investor composition elasticities. Corporate bonds held predominantly by insurers rather than mutual funds suffer milder losses in downturns: increasing insurer holdings by half a bond’s size causes 20% shallower drawdowns. A shift-share instrument isolates variation from large insurers’ idiosyncratic primary-market allocations. Differences in intermediaries’ liability structures drive these results, which hold across countries. During crises, firms with more stable bondholders maintain higher borrowing at lower cost and invest more. (JEL G00, G12, G23, G30, E22, E30)</content>

    <title>Common Pricing of Decentralized Risk: A Linear Option Pricing Model</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a top-down linear option pricing model that unifies the pricing of different option contracts not by assuming common dynamics but by imposing common pricing on each risk source in proportion to decentralized risk estimates. The model generates significantly better pricing performance than existing bottom-up models. Its high-dimensional risk structure effectively explains the options return variation, allowing for the seamless integration of option pricing with risk management. The market price of risk estimate from the model strongly predicts the future excess return of the corresponding risk-targeting option portfolio, an important dimension of attribute completely absent from prior literature.

    <title>‘Bad’ Oil, ‘Worse’ Oil and Carbon Misallocation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Not all barrels of oil are created equal: their extraction varies in both private cost and carbon intensity. Leveraging a comprehensive micro-dataset on world oil fields, alongside detailed estimates of carbon intensities and private extraction costs, this study quantifies the additional emissions and costs from having extracted the ’wrong’ deposits. We do so by comparing historical deposit-level supplies to counterfactuals that factor in pollution costs, while keeping annual global consumption unchanged. Between 1992 and 2018, carbon misallocation amounted to at least 11.00 gigatons of CO2-equivalent, incurring an environmental cost evaluated at $2.2 trillion (US$2018). This translates into a significant supply-side ecological debt for major producers of high-carbon oil. Looking forward, we estimate the gains from making deposit-level extraction socially optimal at about 9.30 gigatons of CO2-equivalent evaluated at $1.9 trillion along a future aggregate demand pathway coherent with the objective of net-zero emissions in 2050, and document unequal reserve stranding across oil nations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do global value chain (GVC) linkages modify countries’ incentives to impose import protection? Are these linkages important determinants of trade policy in practice? We develop a new approach to modeling tariff setting with GVCs, in which optimal policy depends on the nationality of value-added content embedded in home and foreign final goods. Theory predicts that discretionary tariffs will be decreasing in the domestic content of foreign-produced final goods and the foreign content of domestically-produced final goods. Using data for 14 countries between 1995 and 2015, we show that governments set lower tariffs and curb their use of temporary trade barriers where GVC linkages are strongest, consistent with theory. Turning to quantitative model counterfactuals, we find that severing GVC linkages would lead to the disappearance of tariff preferences. Further, targeted policies to decouple China from GVCs would increase the optimal tariff set by G7 countries on Chinese exports.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Facilitated by information technology and online platforms, group service has emerged in many service systems, such as one-to-many tour guide service, one-to-many tutoring courses and one-to-many medical diagnosis. We consider a service provider offering both group service and individual service and model it as a single-server queue in which customers with heterogeneous waiting costs make both joining/balking and group/individual service decisions. We solve the private provider's service assortment and pricing strategies for profit maximization (system C), whose solution leads to six equilibrium structures. Furthermore, both equilibrium service volume and service price are nonmonotonic in the potential arrival rate, which contradicts classical theory due to the follow-the-crowd (FTC) characteristics associated with group service. This leads to a counterintuitive and novel pricing implication: sustaining full coverage in a larger market may necessitate an increase in service prices when group service is offered. We then numerically show that the optimal group size is unique. Furthermore, compared with scenarios where only individual service is provided, the simultaneous provision of both services can create a win-win-win situation, particularly when the potential arrival rate is relatively high. We extend the discussion to the scenario with a welfare-maximizing objective (system S) and show that the aforementioned results continue to hold. Furthermore, we find that the socially optimal price is lower than the profit-maximizing price, resulting in a larger total number of customers served in system S. Notably, our findings suggest that system S is more likely to provide group service and achieve full market coverage than system C.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Customized mystery bag/box products are examples of a new business model of combining probabilistic selling and customization in practice. We develop an analytical framework to study the economic value of customized mystery bag/box products and explore the interrelationship between probabilistic selling and customization. We define probabilistic selling and customization to be complements (substitutes) as that customization increases (decreases) the value of probabilistic selling. We find that probabilistic selling and customization may be either complements or substitutes, which depends on the customization level and the product marginal cost. As long as customization level is low and product marginal cost is high, they are generally complements. The complementarity benefit comes from the fact that customization can enhance probabilistic selling's price improvement value when the customization level is sufficiently low. In addition, the complementarity benefit reaches the maximum when the product marginal cost is sufficiently large and the customization is at an intermediate level. We further show that probabilistic selling and customization may still be complements when the customization level is endogenously determined with investment cost, when the customization service is strategically chosen by consumers, when the inventory decision is optimized with demand uncertainty, or when customization is achieved by product assortment planning.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Behaviour-Based Pricing for Competing Firms Facing Variety-Seeking Consumers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many firms adopt behavioural-based pricing (BBP) to customize prices for both existing and new consumers whose valuations of products are influenced by the variety-seeking behaviour, i.e., the tendency to pursue diversity in brand or product choices. While this behaviour is common in practice, it remains under-explored in the literature. To investigate BBP in markets with variety-seeking consumers, we develop a two-period model involving two competing firms. Our findings reveal that when firms adopt BBP, a greater degree of variety-seeking among consumers mitigates first-period price competition, resulting in higher profits for the firms. The adoption of BBP increases profits when consumers exhibit high variety-seeking behaviour, enhances consumer welfare when this behaviour is low, and can lead to mutually beneficial outcomes for both firms and consumers. If a firm unilaterally adopts BBP, its competitor benefits when the consumer’s variety-seeking degree is high. In scenarios where firms can strategically decide whether to adopt BBP, asymmetric equilibria may arise, with only one firm choosing to implement it. Firms may strategically adopt BBP without necessarily price-discriminating consumers, as the potential for price discrimination can reduce first-period competition. When BBP is exogenously feasible, firms experience higher profits in relation to the consumer’s variety-seeking degree compared with when it is not feasible, with gains from BBP feasibility increasing as the degree of variety-seeking rises. In addition, with behavioural-based personalized pricing, i.e., firms can charge tailored prices to existing consumers, profits also increase with the consumer’s variety-seeking degree. However, with behavioural-based services, i.e., firms can customize prices for both new and past consumers and provide additional services to previous customers, as variety-seeking behaviour increases, service levels decline while profits initially decrease before they rise again. These findings highlight the distinct characteristics of BBP and elucidate various real-world operational strategies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research assesses the impact of Indian government-mandated firms’ corporate social responsibility (CSR) related investments on gross margins. Using a multi-method approach, we show (i) a positive relationship between CSR investments and gross margin and (ii) the moderating role of advertising investment. The contribution of our research is three-fold. First, our results suggest that mandating firms to spend on CSR can be a win-win situation for firms and governments, as opposed to the view of considering mandatory CSR as an additional burden. Second, our inquiry is one of the first to analytically and empirically show CSR contribution positively affects gross margin premium, which is based on price, an important revenue-generating marketing and operations construct. Third, we show the moderating role of advertising in achieving CSR related gross-margin premium. We discuss our study’s implications for marketing and operations managers and policymakers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Currently, major online retail platforms, such as Amazon and JD, provide both conventional reselling channels and online marketplaces (i.e., agency channels), enabling their suppliers to encroach more efficiently than the traditional self-established direct channel. We construct a parsimonious model of a bilateral monopoly supply chain where the supplier can encroach through online marketplaces as both reselling and agency channels are available. Surprisingly, the encroachment option does not necessarily benefit the supplier. Unlike the traditional supplier encroachment literature, the supplier now always prefers simultaneous ordering, suggesting that more information can hurt the supplier. We further characterize the retailer’s channel offering strategy and identify a win-win region where both firms prefer encroachment (i.e., the hybrid mode). Our work provides a guideline for supplier encroachment in the era of dominant platforms and sheds light on its impact on vertical channel relationships.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Sellers’ Peer Comparison under Uncertainty in Online Marketplace</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How will peer pressure among sellers affect their operations in an online marketplace? Motivated by online platforms’ marketplace designs that prompt sellers to compare their performances, in this paper, we develop and study a price competition model in which sellers account for both profits and peer comparison outcomes. In our model, two sellers offer substitutable products, and each of them sets a price ex ante to maximize their expected total utility, which is the sum of one’s profit and the payoff from peer comparison. In particular, peer comparison takes place ex post based on sellers’ realized sales. It results in a penalty for one’s underperformance (i.e., sellers are behind-averse) or a reward for outperformance (i.e., sellers are ahead-seeking) relative to the other seller. Contrary to what extant research on social comparison would predict, we find that peer comparison is not always pro-competitive. Indeed, while the behind-aversion aspect of peer comparison fosters competition, the ahead-seeking aspect can be anti-competitive when the market uncertainty is sufficiently large. This is because market uncertainty causes a greatervariationin sellers’ performance disparity ex post (uncertainty effect), which can have a more salient impact on sellers than theexpectationof their performance gap (comparison effect); While sellers’ behind-aversion further aggravates the uncertainty effect and encourages them to take more aggressive actions, their ahead-seeking counterbalances the tension by absorbing part of it into the comparison effect and moderating the marginal disutility of lagging behind. Overall, we find that peer comparison can intensify sellers’ price competition, which lowers the expected profits and utilities for both sellers, benefits the consumers, and reduces the hosting platform’s profit. Our main insights are robust in a number of extensions, including general demand specifications, seller asymmetry, sellers’ misperceptions of market uncertainties, and consumers’ reference-dependent decision-making. They highlight the importance of sellers’ behavioral regularities in online platforms’ daily operations and shed light on marketplace designs regarding algorithmic transparency, information sharing, and so forth.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The COVID-19 crisis has starkly highlighted the vulnerability of businesses and underscored the critical importance of organizational resilience. Firms across multiple sectors—particularly non-essential businesses—have suffered a heavy blow during the height of the pandemic. Guided by the resource dependence theory and using a proprietary and rich dataset from a leading online-to-offline (O2O) platform for medical aesthetics services—a typical type of non-essential business, we find that the pandemic adversely affects clinic performance in terms of the number of orders a clinic received on the platform. However, the adoption of telemedicine enables clinics to mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic on clinic performance, which is referred to as “digital resilience”. Moreover, we reveal that the mitigating effect of telemedicine adoption on clinic performance is stronger for smaller clinics and those focusing on lower-risk products. Additional analyses reveal that telemedicine also bolsters consumer interest in specific products during the pandemic, regardless of the product risk level. Furthermore, telemedicine takes effect amid the pandemic mainly by cultivating the interests of more experienced consumers. Our study contributes to the operations management literature by exploring the impacts of COVID-19 and digital resilience in non-essential sectors. It also offers practical insights for these businesses to improve their crisis responses and gain strategic digital resilience in the face of a sudden crisis.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dominant online platforms are increasingly collecting user-specific data across multiple markets, raising red flags as regards privacy, as well as potential anti-competitive abuses. We analyze competition among two platforms, with one platform collecting data in market 1 where it is dominant, using it to improve its competitive edge in market 2 where it competes in both prices and advertisements with the other platform. Our analysis unearths a novel anti-competitive effect of competition – that increased market 2 competition may increase the dominant firm’s market power in market 1, which in turn leads to several interesting results. First, that data collection by the dominant firm is increasing in market 2 competition. Second, efficiency of data collection is non-monotonic in the level of competition; being, from a welfare perspective, excessive (respectively low) whenever market competition is at an intermediate level (respectively weak). We then use this framework to examine several policy proposals – user control of data, blocking data-driven mergers, restricting data collection, and allowing data-sharing – deriving actionable prescriptions for managers and policymakers. For example, in markets with effective ad-targeting, we find that user control of data decreases data collection, thus improving privacy, if and only if competition is strong.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Modern decision-support applications build on planning parameters such as lead time, price, yield, etc., which are maintained as master data. The accuracy of master data significantly influences the viability of such applications. However, the maintenance of master data is considered a tedious and error-prone task. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of plan lead times. We apply both unsupervised and supervised learning methods for creating lead time prediction models. We test our approach using historical data of a global equipment manufacturer. In a numerical analysis the calculated plan lead times are over 30% more accurate than current plan lead times in terms of mean-squared-error (MSE). This increased accuracy of plan lead times reduces inventory investment by approximately 7%.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Joint Estimation of the Arrival Rate and Customer Taste Coefficients from Censored Transactional Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This work aims to jointly estimate the arrival rate of customers to a market and the nested logit model that forecasts hierarchical customer choices from an assortment of products. The estimation is based on censored transactional data, where lost sales are not recorded. The goal is to determine the arrival rate, customer taste coefficients, and nest dissimilarity parameters that maximize the likelihood of the observed data. The problem is formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation model that addresses two prevailing challenges in the existing literature: estimating demand fromdata with unobservable lost salesand capturingcustomer taste heterogeneity arising from hierarchical choices. However, the model is intractable to solve or analyze due to the non-concavity of the likelihood function in both taste coefficients and dissimilarity parameters. We characterize conditions under which the model parameters are identifiable. Our results reveal that the parameter identification is influenced by thediversity of products and nests. We also develop a sequential minorization-maximization algorithm to solve the problem, by which the problem boils down to solving a series of convex optimization models with simple structures. Then, we show the convergence of the algorithm by leveraging the structural properties of these models. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm by comparing it with widely used benchmarks, using both synthetic and real data. Our findings show that the algorithm consistently outperforms the benchmarks in maximizing in-sample likelihood and ranks among the top two in out-of-sample prediction accuracy. Moreover, our algorithm is particularly effective in estimating nested logit models with low dissimilarity parameters, yielding higher profitability compared to the benchmarks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To mitigate information asymmetry, Expert Review Programs, in which experts evaluate products on multiple dimensions, have gained traction on platforms. However, the role of multi-dimensional expert reviews and how they affect consumer behaviors remain unknown. Using an empirical opportunity on an automobile review platform, we investigate how multi-dimensional expert reviews affect subsequent consumer ratings and the underlying mechanism. Our findings first reveal that expert reviews tend to be neutral and more critical than consumer ratings. We then find that consumers provide reviews with higher ratings following expert reviews due to the information disclosure effect. Decomposing the effect by expert reviews’ multi-dimensional characteristics, we find the effect is attenuated by multi-dimensional expert rating valence and multi-dimensional rating discrepancy between experts and consumers but amplified by multi-dimensional expert rating variance. Natural language processing of consumer review texts unveils a positive impact of multi-dimensional expert reviews on consumer satisfaction and a negative impact on consumer disappointment, which speaks to the underlying mechanism behind the information disclosure effect. Lastly, we find that the effect varies with expert characteristics, product characteristics, and information channels, diminishes when multi-dimensional expert reviews are posted sooner after product launch, and decays over time but persists in the long run. These findings not only advance information theories in understanding expert reviews and multi-dimensional rating systems but also provide valuable insights for stakeholders, such as platforms, firms, and expert reviewers, to improve review program operations and consumer engagement.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Team Design and Its Implications for Competition and Disclosure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how the composition of managerial teams influences the information and competitive landscapes in which firms operate. Specifically, the impact of teams depends on the task environment under which they operate and the extent of competition the firm faces in the product markets. Under a substitute task environment, team heterogeneity better facilitates firm learning, whereas, under a complementary task environment, team homogeneity enhances learning. However, more learning is not always optimal, as this accentuates adverse selection concerns, which leads the firm’s rival to counter by becoming more aggressive in competition. This, in turn, forces the firm to cede some of its information advantage through disclosures. In effect, when designing teams to manage information, the firm must balance its learning needs with its rival’s competitive threats. Consequently, in a substitute task environment, team heterogeneity is only optimal for the firm when competition is not fierce, and homogeneity is desirable otherwise. In a complementary task environment, the preference for teams as a function of competition is reversed. Additionally, any inherent heterogeneity in the level of competition in the product markets in which the firm operates diminishes the demand for team heterogeneity. The paper also derives the firm’s optimal team composition when the markets are characterized by Bertrand or Cournot competition; when the available managerial pool for the firm is constrained or unconstrained; when tasks are market-specific or firm specific; and when the task environment is generalized.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the increasingly uncertain future of brick-and-mortar (B&amp;M) retailing, companies are exploring new ways to avoid the high costs associated with maintaining traditional, full-service retail stores. One solution, pop-up stores, has gained popularity in recent years. This paper uses empirical evidence from a leading U.S. retailer to examine the value of pop-up retailing. Specifically, we focus on pop-up stores operated by a traditional multichannel retailer over three years and examine their impact on customer demand and order fulfillment in the short run and long run. We further evaluate whether the impact of a pop-up store is sensitive to its operational terms, including whether it is a first-time or returning “pop-up” to a market region and the duration of the store. Using a quasi-field experiment, we find that having pop-up stores leads to an expansion in the overall demand during and after operations, indicating a spillover effect that extends beyond a pop-up store's limited operational window. From an operational perspective, our empirical evidence suggests that customers migrate from the online channel to pop-up stores for faster demand fulfillment. Moreover, recurring pop-up stores are slightly less effective at stimulating local demand than first-time pop-up stores. Finally, results reveal that pop-up stores are not as effective as permanent stores in generating demand; however, the flexibility in operations still makes pop-up stores an attractive physical retail format, especially for exploring markets with modest potential.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, “super fakes,” i.e., high-quality counterfeits, have gained popularity. The ability of super fake manufacturers to produce high-quality products has inspired a novel anti-counterfeiting measure:converting counterfeiters to authorized suppliers. We develop a game-theoretic model to examine the interactions between a brand-name firm with a licit home supplier and a counterfeiter who can be potentially converted to an authorized overseas supplier. Our analysis leads to three main results. First, the brand-name firm can convert the counterfeiter to a licit supplier through either dual sourcing or single sourcing when the cost differential between two suppliers is moderate to high, or the quality perception differential between brand-name products produced by two suppliers is low. However, this conversion does not necessarily prevent counterfeiting unless the penalty from law enforcement is stringent. Our paper recommends that brand-name firms strategically use their wholesale pricing and sourcing decisions to establish socially responsible supply chain operations and prevent counterfeiting. Second, while dual sourcing is known for its risk diversification, our study identifies another benefit previously not reported in the literature: mitigating counterfeit risks. Dual sourcing can be more effective than single sourcing as the quality perception of super fakes approaches that of brand-name products, and its effectiveness becomes more pronounced when the brand-name firm offers wholesale price contracts in a sequential order. Conversely, single sourcing is preferable under conditions of high cost differential and low quality perception differential. Lastly, converting counterfeiters to authorized suppliers can reduce consumer surplus and does not improve social surplus unless authorities enforce high penalties on counterfeiters or the cost differential between two suppliers is substantial.</content>

This legislation aims to stimulate product and process innovations that reduce the environmental impact of E-waste. In this study, we employ a staggered difference-in-differences approach to explore the causal relationship between state E-waste regulations and eco-innovation among producers. Our results indicate that E-waste regulations significantly boost the number of eco-patents filed by producers, with the effect intensifying as regulatory pressure increases. Additionally, our findings show that regulated producers tend to focus more on upstream resource efficiency innovations than on downstream waste management. This research offers valuable insights for policymakers and industry practitioners aiming to enhance practices for E-waste management.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Customer service has evolved beyond in-person visits and phone calls to include live chat, AI chatbots and social media, among other contact options. Service providers typically refer to these contact modalities as “channels”. Within each channel, customer service agents are tasked with managing and resolving a stream of inbound service requests. Each request involves milestones where the agent must decide whether to keep assisting the customer or to transfer them to a more skilled – and often costlier – provider. To understand how this request resolution process should be managed, we develop a model in which each channel is represented as a gatekeeper system and characterize the structure of the optimal request resolution policy. We then turn to the broader question of the firm’s customer service design, which includes the strategic problem of which channels to deploy, the tactical questions of at what level to staff the live-agent channel and to what extent to train an AI chatbot, and the operational question of how to control the live-agent channel. Examining the interplay between strategic, tactical, and operational decisions through numerical methods, we show, among other insights, that service quality can be improved, rather than diminished, by chatbot implementation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online platforms that rely on voluntary user contributions face persistent challenges in maintaining sustained and active participation. This study investigates the effectiveness of a unique combination of social mechanisms—a group reputation system—in motivating individual voluntary contributions within the context of online prosocial crowdfunding. While a strong group identity can inspire member participation, the study also acknowledges a potential downside: a positive group reputation may “crowd out” individual contributions by signaling the efforts of other members. Using data collected from Kiva, we empirically examine the impact of group reputation, measured in the form of group rankings, on both overall team contributions and individual member contributions. The findings indicate that teams with higher rankings experience a decline in subsequent contributions, supporting the idea of group reputation as a public good. Further analyses explore the mechanisms driving this negative impact, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of group reputation systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Federal agencies use reverse auctions to procure cloud infrastructure services offered by major public cloud providers such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Although recent research has examined operational issues in cloud computing, these papers have not analyzed the vendor base design decisions when these cloud capacity instances are procured through the reverse auction mechanism. Therefore, several important research questions are still unaddressed. For example, how should federal clients decide on the number of cloud providers for the multi-cloud strategy? How should clients decide on private cloud capacity investments along with sourcing requirements from multiple cloud providers? We find that the client’s capacity portfolio decision is determined by factors such as vendors’ cost heterogeneity and available capacity. Specifically, we find higher cost heterogeneity leads to a smaller vendor base. Interestingly and somewhat counter-intuitively, we find that higher cost heterogeneity may increase or decrease private cloud investments. We also study the client’s decision on the type of capacity instances to be procured via reverse auctions. We find federal clients should only utilize the on-demand instances mechanism (where capacity is procured after demand realization) to fulfill the cloud computing requirements. We further observe that if vendors experience capacity outages, then the client should upfront reserve capacity instances.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the competition between two software vendors: one offering software as a service (SaaS) and the other providing on-premises software, both facing software upgrades with different customizability and implementation costs. We build a theoretical model to explore the vendor’s pricing and market segmentation strategies. We find that (1) enhancing the customizability of SaaS software does not necessarily benefit the SaaS vendor, nor does it necessarily harm the on-premises vendor, depending on the current level of the SaaS software’s customizability; (2) The SaaS vendor generally prefers pay-per-use pricing to subscription pricing because it can not only serve more consumers, but also help relieve competition pressure from the on-premises vendor; (3) Adopting a hybrid model is not necessarily profit enhancing. Specifically, while the SaaS vendor always benefits from adopting a hybrid pricing strategy, the on-premises vendor may be better off by either not offering or offering a SaaS version with limited customizability, even if it does not make sales. Nevertheless, both vendors adopting a hybrid model leads to socially efficient competition outcome, where both vendors and consumers are better off, a win-win-win scenario.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study experimentally investigates the ordering behavior of a financially constrained newsvendor‐like retailer facing stochastic demand under trade credit. Using controlled laboratory experiments, we examine the ordering behavior of a retailer procuring inventory on trade credit from the supplier under no‐bankruptcy risk (NBR) and bankruptcy risk (BR) at low‐ and high‐profit margins. Our experimental observations show deviations from normative optimality, and we find a contrast in the ordering behavior in NBR and BR settings. Compared to the respective normative optimal quantities, in the NBR setting, retailers overorder in the low‐profit margin and underorder in the high‐profit margin conditions, whereas, in the BR setting, consistent underordering is observed in both the low and high‐profit margin conditions. Next, we employ a dynamic panel regression model driven by the demand‐chasing heuristic to capture the ordering pattern. Finally, we develop a prospect theoretic model to describe the underordering behavior observed in the BR setting and find that the reference point plays a key role. Our results provide insights into the need to identify the behavior of financially constrained retailers and develop descriptive models for improved decision making.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Location-based advertising is increasingly prevalent thanks to advanced data tracking and targeting infrastructure. By combining TV ad viewership data with mobile location data of 6.4 million users, we study spatial heterogeneity in retail advertising effectiveness in the home improvement industry. The granularity of user locations that goes beyond the targeting capabilities of traditional TV ads allows us to identify spatially heterogeneous effects. Contrary to the conventional focus on radius-based targeting, we find that spatial heterogeneity is more nuanced. First, geo-competitive structure plays an important role in determining advertising effectiveness, with the proximity of a store relative to its rival serving as a significant moderator. Second, advertising effectiveness has an inverted U-shaped relationship with a customer’s distance to the store, reflecting differences in customer information. Moreover, spatial heterogeneity varies across ad types: price-promotional ads tend to influence customers closer to the store and steal rival traffic, compared to non-promotional ads. Overall, our findings offer valuable insights for location-based advertising strategies and platform targeting design.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Consumers Believe Legal Products Are Less Effective than Illegal Products</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research examines how consumers judge a product’s effectiveness based on its legal status. Across eight pre-registered experiments, we find that consumers tend to believe legal products are less effective than illegal ones. Even when observing identical, objective product outcomes (e.g., equal weight loss from a drug), consumers perceive reduced product benefits from a product described as legal (vs. illegal). We test an account of why this belief occurs. When a product is legal, consumers infer that the government allows broad access to it, which they associate with lower product strength. In contrast, illegal products, which consumers presume are harder to access, are viewed as higher in product strength. This strength inference leads consumers to believe a legal product produces smaller effects than an illegal product—both smaller positive effects (lower efficacy) and smaller negative effects (lower harm). Supporting this theory, the impact of legality on perceived efficacy is eliminated if legal and illegal products are described as equally accessible or equally strong. We further demonstrate that these beliefs influence consumer choice. Given the significant health and economic consequences of illegal product consumption, this research has important implications for consumers, marketers, public health professionals, and policymakers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While most marketing studies have focused on what salespeople say, less is known about the persuasiveness of how they say it, particularly in the distinct contexts of customer acquisition and retention. This research investigates how salespeople’s vocal brightness and loudness influence new and existing customers’ purchase behavior. Based on two studies conducted in China (a field study using a large real-world dataset of over 8,000 telephone calls and a randomized controlled experiment), the authors find that high brightness and high loudness positively predict new customers’ purchase behavior and timing, whereas low brightness and high loudness positively affect existing customers’ repurchase behavior and timing. The authors demonstrate that perceived arousal is the underlying mechanism driving customers’ purchase behavior in customer acquisition, while perceived competence serves as a mediator in customer retention. No effect of brightness or loudness on purchase volume is observed in either customer acquisition or retention. This research makes theoretical contributions to the marketing and nonverbal communication literature. It also provides valuable managerial insights regarding how to manipulate voice features to improve sales performance.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Too Many or Too Few? Information Cues in Recommender Systems and Consequences for Search and Purchase Behavior</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how the number of information cues in recommender systems influences consumer search and purchase. E-commerce platforms often display a list of recommended products on product pages, where consumers can browse and click on individual items for details. Given space constraints, determining the appropriate amount of information to display is crucial, as it affects consumers’ use of both recommender systems and non-recommender search tools. Through a field experiment with an online retailer, we test four information designs: no cues (product name only), single cues (either price or review), and dual cues (price and review). We find an inverted U-shaped relationship between the number of information cues and sales, with single cues yielding the highest sales compared to both more (dual cues) and less information (no cues). This nonlinear effect stems from the interplay between search intensity and efficiency. The no-cue condition increases search intensity but forces consumers to rely on a less efficient non-recommender search process. In contrast, the highly efficient dual-cue condition provides sufficient information for evaluation but discourages further exploration beyond recommenders. Single cues strike a balance, offering just enough information to aid product evaluation while maintaining high search intensity across both recommender and non-recommender tools.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In sectors across the experience economy—from live sports to festivals, nightlife entertainment, private members’ clubs, and invite-only events—firms compete by staging social atmospheres. When firms successfully stage social atmospheres, they benefit from enhanced customer experiences, loyalty, and place attachment. However, social atmospheres often fail when firms struggle to bring together the ‘optimal mix’ of customers. Yet marketing research offers limited insight into how firms can attract and select heterogeneous customers who fit together productively to create meaningful shared experiences of place. Accordingly, this article draws on aesthetic work literature to conceptualizesocial atmosphere curation—the process through which firms manage customer heterogeneity to achieve social fit as a means to stage social atmospheres. Through an ethnographic study of Berlin’s iconic electronic music club scene, this paper reveals a three-stage social atmosphere curation model, comprising curation mechanisms of cultivation, selection, and mystification. This research advances marketing scholarship’s understanding of social atmospheres, customer heterogeneity, and marketplace inclusion and exclusion. By outlining the managerial tasks associated with each curation mechanism, this study provides actionable guidance for managers across various service contexts on how to curate the right crowd to deliberately stage social atmospheres.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The well-established disruptive effects of employee turnover on firms have typically been attributed to post-exit dynamics, such as losses of human and social capital. Little is known, however, about leavers’ pre-exit job performance, which, if declining in sufficient magnitude as separation nears, may drive some of this disruption. Drawing on career concerns research, we argue that impending exit weakens incentives to improve future career prospects at the firm, thereby resulting in reduced performance. Our analysis reveals strikingly large negative relationships, as job performance during the impending-exit period declines by 53.9% and 79.8% across two performance measures. Additionally, we predict and find that these performance decrements are more pronounced for junior-level employees and partially mitigated for those anticipating a continuing relationship with the organization after exit. We test our predictions using longitudinal data on 4,104 patent examiners who left the United States Patent and Trademark Office from 2001 to 2018.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this editorial, we discuss and define the “future of work” as a phenomenon and research area, and outline avenues for further research at the conceptual and empirical level. We first offer a brief review of the different streams of research that study the future of work, both in management and organization studies and in adjacent fields. We then elaborate on what we see as the most promising avenues for research on the future of work, organized around five questions of what, when, who, how, and why. That is, research on the future of work needs to clarify its assumptions about (1) the phenomena it considers within scope; (2) the temporality associated with these phenomena; (3) which future of work actors it is about and whom it is for; (4) the methods and data types used to be able to study the future empirically; and (5) desired impact and envisioned outcomes. We discuss how moving beyond techno-determinism, depoliticization, and a present-day focus could open up new and important avenues for further research on the near and distant future of work. We conclude with some specific examples of research questions and methods.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractThis study analyzes whether a ride-hailing platform should adopt a closed business model, that is, serving riders only with platform-owned vehicles, or an open business model, that is, allowing private vehicles to utilize the platform to provide services. Analytical results reveal that the open business model leads to more service supply (supply-augmenting effect) and a lower price increase (price discrimination–hindering effect) in the surge period, both benefiting riders. It also reduces the number of idle vehicles in the normal period, thus resulting in more efficient utilization of vehicle resources. Interestingly, the platform does not always benefit from adopting the open business model. In sum, the open business model always benefits the riders, private drivers, and the society as a whole, but it may not be more profitable for the platform. This interesting result calls for policymakers to incentivize the platform so that it adopts the open business model instead of the closed one.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present evidence that loan allocations and loan terms are closely linked to the strength of social connections between bank and borrower regions. Lending increases with social connectedness, particularly in the presence of strong screening incentives. If connectedness is high, banks discriminate between borrowers more, the terms of originated loans are more borrower friendly, and loan performance is better. Furthermore, social connectedness is associated with higher bank profitability and with lending-related increases in borrower-region GDP growth and employment. Our results suggest that lending barriers decrease with social connectedness, which helps our understanding of geographic lending patterns and regional economic disparities.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present a model rationalizing the economic value of digital tokens for launching peer-to-peer platforms. By using the blockchain to transparently distribute tokens before the platform launches, a token sale overcomes later coordination failures between the platform’s users. This result follows from forward induction reasoning, under which the costly and observable action of token acquisition credibly communicates the intent to participate on the platform. Our framework demonstrates the applications of digital tokens to entrepreneurship, and offers guidance for both practitioners and regulators. (JEL C72, C73, L26, D85, G23)</content>

    <title>Beefing IT Up for Your Investor? Engagement with Open Source Communities, Innovation, and Startup Funding: Evidence from GitHub</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the engagement of nascent firms with open source communities and its implications for innovation and attracting funding. To do so, we link data on 160,065 U.S. startups from Crunchbase to their activities on the open source software development platform GitHub. In a matched sample of firms with and without GitHub activities, difference-in-differences models reveal a substantial increase in the likelihood of being funded after early stage startups engage with open source communities on GitHub. This relationship is weaker for firms that employ GitHub for internal development only. Startups developing novel technologies tend to benefit more from engaging with open source communities, unlike those in highly competitive environments. This heterogeneity highlights a potential trade-off between engaging with open source communities and appropriability. To provide insight regarding mechanisms, we classify startups’ technology use-cases on GitHub using machine learning and exploit data on product launches. Our results from these additional analyses support the notion that one important channel potentially driving our findings is the access to external knowledge for technology development provided by open source communities. Engaging with these communities may thereby aid startups in innovating and creating a (minimum) viable product.Funding: A. Conti and C.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a unified framework to examine the implications of two primary approaches to strategic decision making under uncertainty: designing and shaping future scenarios vis-à-vis testing theories about future scenarios. We conducted a three-arm randomized controlled trial involving 308 early stage entrepreneurs, dividing them into three groups—design-based training, theory-based training, and a control group—and tracked them over approximately 1.5 years. Our findings reveal that both approaches reduce the need for information in decision making and lead to higher commitment rates. The design-based approach encourages action despite negative beliefs, resulting in less frequent and later project termination. In contrast, the theory-based approach promotes a more conservative termination rule, leading to earlier and more frequent project abandonment. Although the theory-based approach is associated with higher average performance upon survival, the design-based approach fosters breakthroughs for decision makers. In sum, the design-based approach is well-suited for innovative ventures that gather information to shape their environment, whereas the theory-based approach is optimal for pursuing high performance under lower degrees of uncertainty.Funding: The research leading to these results has received funding from the Italian Ministry for Education, “Entrepreneurs as Scientists: When and How Start-ups Benefit from a Scientific Approach to Decision Making” project [Grant PRIN 2017, Prot. 2017PM7R52, CUP J44I20000220001].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18245 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A project involves several participants—including clients, contractors, and subcontractors—that work concurrently on multiple projects and allocate resources among them. This interdependency creates a network of otherwise-unrelated projects. We map the network of U.S. government projects involving over 150,000 participants. We show that a seemingly localized disruption, affecting only one project site, eventually causes delays across unrelated projects. This is because participants opportunistically reallocate resources into disrupted projects, at the expense of other projects, triggering a domino effect of further reallocations in the network. Thus, the costs of on-site disruptions end up being shared by multiple participants in the network, rather than being fully absorbed by the affected project. Performance-based incentives, which reward contractors for timeliness, exacerbate these externalities by encouraging self-interested resource reallocation.This paper was accepted by Karan Girotra, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [Grant RGPIN-2017-04523].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01574 .</content>

    <title>Routine and Innovative Use of Enterprise System: Intricacy of Change Management Levers, System Characteristics, and Regulatory Focus</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study explores how organizational contexts, system design, and individual differences shape employees’ use of enterprise systems (ESs) and their impact on job outcomes. By examining leadership styles (transactional versus transformational), support structures (impersonal versus personal), and system characteristics (modularity and complexity), we highlight the role of employees’ situational regulatory focus (prevention versus promotion) in determining routine and innovative use of ES. Our findings show that leadership and support structures affect ES usage through employees’ regulatory focus, with transactional leadership and impersonal support fostering routine use and transformational leadership and personal support encouraging innovative use. System modularity enhances the relationship between prevention focus and routine use, whereas complexity strengthens the link between promotion focus and innovative use but weakens the relationship between prevention focus and routine ES use. Both routine and innovative ES use influence the employees’ job outcomes, including job performance and satisfaction. For organizations, this means that effective change management and ES design should align with employees’ regulatory focus and leadership strategies to maximize system adoption and improve performance. This study offers practical insights for designing more effective ES implementation strategies and tailoring support to boost employee engagement and outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study how the secular decline in interest rates affects banks' intermediation spreads and credit supply. Following a permanent decrease in rates, bank lending may rise initially but contracts in the long run. As lower rates compress deposit spreads even well above the zero lower bound, banks' retained earnings, equity, and lending fall until loan spreads have risen enough to offset the reduction in deposit spreads. A higher inflation target can support bank lending at the cost of higher liquidity premia. I find support for the model's predictions in U.S. aggregate and bank‐level data.</content>

    <title>Intrahousehold Disagreement about Macroeconomic Expectations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper highlights the simple fact that households typically consist of multiple members who may hold divergent views, a fact that existing approaches to measuring and modeling household macroeconomic expectations largely abstract from. Using unique data on the macroeconomic expectations of both spouses, I document substantial intrahousehold disagreement about inflation, economic recessions, and stock market returns. I further show that household asset allocation decisions are shaped by disagreement between spouses about future stock returns, and a preregistered randomized survey experiment confirms the causal impact of such disagreement on portfolio choice.</content>
