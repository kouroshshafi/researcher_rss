    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bankruptcy reforms that improve lenders’ ability to recover claims from financially distressed borrowers can mitigate zombie lending. However, we show that after a 2016 bankruptcy reform in India, lenders are reluctant to recognize zombie credit as nonperforming, impeding reform efficacy. A subsequent complementary regulation targeting lender discretion in recognizing nonperforming assets improves zombie recognition fivefold. The lender disincentive to recognize zombies arises from undercapitalized banks’ reluctance to realize loan losses and political economy frictions at state-owned banks. Resolving zombie credit allows lenders to redirect credit to healthy borrowers, but effects are muted at banks more exposed to zombie borrowers.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Funding: The authors are grateful for financial support provided by the NSE-NYU Stern Initiative on the Study of Indian Capital Markets.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01356 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Work experiences and political participation outside work are intrinsically linked. Management scholars have acknowledged the role that organizations play in shaping political behavior from a firm-level perspective, but the specific working conditions and how they translate into employee political participation and attitudes outside work remain poorly understood. This paper offers an interdisciplinary review of the empirical literature from the past 25 years across the management and political science disciplines. It examines how individual work-related experiences (broadly categorized into job content, working environment, employment characteristics, and social relations at work) relate to political engagement outside of work: political participation, political attitudes, political trust, and political values. The results show that enabling work experiences (e.g., more skill use, autonomy, higher income, more social interactions) and experiences that caused grievances (e.g., more job or financial insecurity) were both related to more political participation but differed in their effect on political trust and regarding political attitudes on economic and cultural issues. We also review the main theoretical explanations and consolidate contradictions. Finally, we propose a future research agenda, calling for the expansion of theoretical lenses, a focus on individual-level explanatory mechanisms, and more multilevel research.</content>

    <title>The Affective Revolution in Entrepreneurship: An Integrative Conceptual Review and Guidelines for Future Investigation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurial affect has emerged as a burgeoning area of study, with a wealth of articles demonstrating that affect, broadly conceptualized, plays an important part in entrepreneurial life. While a few affective phenomena, such as passion and positive and negative affect, are primarily driving the affective revolution in entrepreneurship, a wide range of additional forms of affect, from momentary feelings to enduring affective dispositions, have been found to influence entrepreneurs’ judgments, decision-making, attitudes, and behaviors in distinct parts of the entrepreneurial process. Moreover, entrepreneurs’ affective experiences and displays of these experiences influence entrepreneurial behaviors and investors’ decision-making. Although this is an exciting time for work on entrepreneurial affect, several theoretical and empirical inconsistencies impede further knowledge accumulation. To assess how and why affect is critical to entrepreneurship, to clarify the theoretical inconsistencies, and to provide an integrative framework, we conduct a systematic review of 276 published empirical and conceptual articles on entrepreneurial affect. In doing so, we analyze how various affective phenomena (e.g., emotions, moods, sentiments), along with their discrete forms (e.g., anger, grief, happiness), influence and are influenced by specific stages of the entrepreneurial process. We conclude that while this body of research confirms that entrepreneurship is an emotional endeavor, the collective approach has thus far obscured a more detailed and useful understanding of affect in each stage of the entrepreneurial process. We examine the theoretical and empirical approaches taken to date and lay out an agenda for future scholars, thus bolstering the affective revolution in entrepreneurship.</content>

    <title>When does historical context matter? Explaining the emergence of competence-creating subsidiaries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite thorough attention to how context shapes subsidiary behavior, very little IB research has explored the dynamic impact of disruptive changes in historical context on organizational innovations in MNEs. Existing IB theory has robustly theorized the growth of competence-creating subsidiaries from the 1980s to the 2000s. However, our historical research demonstrates that this body of existing theory fails to explain an equally significant growth in subsidiaries with protean competence-creating characteristics from 1945 to 1970. We show that the introduction of the U.K. National Health Service in 1948 precipitated a major upgrade of research capabilities among a near majority of the population of subsidiaries in U.K. pharmaceuticals by 1970. Synthesizing from both IB and literature on historical methods, we analyze the impact of this disruptive transformation in context, identifying the specific mechanisms that produced the rapid growth in what we identify as proto-competence-creating subsidiaries. This occurred in response to a dramatically new context, in ways that differ from those predicted by current theoretical explanations, and led to an institutional innovation hitherto unknown to IB. The implications of this are significant in a contemporary moment of rapid institutional disruption, when existing conceptualizations of subsidiary behavior may increasingly fail to capture real-world dynamics.</content>

    <title>Leveraging the capabilities of multinational firms to address climate change: a finance perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Climate change and the associated issue of curbing carbon emissions have risen on the agenda of policymakers worldwide. However, global coordination on matters such as harmonized regulation has been subject to significant political frictions, and the large intergovernmental transfers needed to finance the transition of developing economies have proven hard to raise. Recently, there have been considerable responses to climate change from the private sector, with stakeholders placing more pressure on firms, and financial markets mobilizing increasingly more capital towards the reduction of negative externalities. We argue that although multinational enterprises (MNEs) have been a major contributor to the problem, they can be an important part of the solution – they have unique features that enable them to play an important role in the fight against climate change. MNEs have extensive and efficient internal markets for governance, financing, and technology, which enable them to circumvent country-specific frictions to climate action such as heterogeneous regulation, corruption, and the lack of technology. We analyze how different public and private incentive mechanisms could be designed to leverage MNEs’ unique features, realign their incentives, and engage their potential to play a role in decarbonizing the economy. Lastly, we discuss challenges, opportunities, and future research.</content>

    <title>Bank Regulation, Investment, and Capital Requirements Under Adverse Selection</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the optimal design of bank capital regulations when capital markets are subject to adverse selection. I show how the implementation of capital requirements can eliminate the information frictions that make raising capital costly by screening banks to reveal their private information to the market. The optimal regulations induce information revelation via recapitalization programs when the banking sector is weak and pool the banks’ private information via uniform capital requirements otherwise. Optimal capital requirements are linked to the securities issued to meet them, demonstrating potential welfare gains from incorporating more and less informationally sensitive securities into the design of capital regulations. Finally, the analysis generates insights for the joint design of equity capital requirements and additional tier 1 capital securities. (JEL D82, G21, G28)</content>

    <title>Public perception and autonomous vehicle liability</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and the accompanying societal and economic benefits will greatly depend on how much liability AV firms will have to carry for accidents involving these vehicles, which in turn impacts their insurability and associated insurance premiums. Across three experiments (N= 2677), we investigate whether accidents where the AV was not at fault could become an unexpected liability risk for AV firms, by exploring consumer perceptions of AV liability. We find that when such accidents occur, the not‐at‐fault vehicle becomes more salient to consumers when it is an AV. As a result, consumers are more likely to view as relevant counterfactuals in which the not‐at‐fault vehicle might have behaved differently to avoid or minimize damage from, the accident. This leads them to judge AV firms as more liable than both firms that make human‐driven vehicles and human drivers for damages when not at fault.</content>

    <title>Breaking Through Only to Break up: A Cross‐Country Analysis of the Speed of Advancement and Exit of Female Executives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the speed of advancements and exits of female executive directors vis‐à‐vis comparable men. In line with recent research, we suggest that women are likely to experience an apparent gender‐based advantage in the form of lower age at the time of their first‐ever executive director appointment. However, we argue that this advantage may be transitory. Appointed women also experience faster exits from these positions, with age partially mediating the differential speed of exits between male and female executive directors. We also contend that these effects are contingent on countries' local gender norms (especially women's economic participation) such that lower gender parity leads to even lower ages at appointments and faster exits for female executive directors. Results based on 15,202 unique rookie executive directors from 33 countries between 2002 and 2015 largely support these predictions.</content>

    <title>Building Micro‐Foundations for Positive Workplace Relationships: Validation of a Strategic Relational Human Resource Management Measure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A growing number of studies have recognized the pivotal role of relational Human Resource Management (HRM) systems in fostering positive interpersonal relationships in the workplace. These systems are tailored to fulfill specific relational objectives through collective‐level mechanisms. However, there has been a notable neglect of strategies for establishing the general foundations of positive workplace relationships and the contributions of individual actors in relationship‐building activities. Drawing upon the multilevel micro‐foundational structure framework and strategic human capital theory, this study introduces and validates a new measure of strategic relational HRM (SRHRM) systems. This measure incorporates a set of interrelated HRM practices aimed at reinforcing individual employees' relational knowledge, skills, and abilities, which serve as micro‐foundations for the development and maintenance of workplace relationships. Our methodology encompasses a meticulous validation process for the SRHRM measure. This involves employing four diverse samples from North America and Asia to assess its content validity, internal consistency, convergent and discriminant validity, as well as criterion‐related validity. Our findings provide substantial support for the application of the SRHRM measure in future empirical investigations.</content>

    <title>Monetary Easing, Leveraged Payouts, and Lack of Investment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a model in which a low monetary policy rate lowers the cost of corporate debt, potentially spurring productive investment; low interest rates, however, also induce firms to lever up so as to increase payouts to equity. Whereas such leveraged payouts privately benefit shareholders, leverage comes at the social cost of distorting their incentives, thereby lowering productivity and discouraging investment. If leverage is unregulated (for example, because of the presence of a shadow banking system), then the optimal monetary policy seeks to contain such socially costly leveraged payouts by stimulating investment in response to adverse shocks only up to a level below the first best. The optimal monetary policy may even consist of leaning against the wind, that is, not stimulating the economy at all, in order to fully contain leveraged payouts and maintain productive efficiency.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01440 .</content>

    <title>ChatGPT for Textual Analysis? How to Use Generative LLMs in Accounting Research</title>
    <updated>2025-01-13T14:38:55.996480+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative large language models (GLLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 by OpenAI, are emerging as powerful tools for textual analysis tasks in accounting research. GLLMs can solve any textual analysis task solvable using nongenerative methods as well as tasks previously only solvable using human coding. Whereas GLLMs are new and powerful, they also come with limitations and present new challenges that require care and due diligence. This paper highlights the applications of GLLMs for accounting research and compares them with existing methods. It also provides a framework on how to effectively use GLLMs by addressing key considerations, such as model selection, prompt engineering, and ensuring construct validity. In a case study, I demonstrate the capabilities of GLLMs by detecting nonanswers in earnings conference calls, a traditionally challenging task to automate. The new GPT method achieves an accuracy of 96% and reduces the nonanswer error rate by 70% relative to the existing Gow et al. (2021) method. Finally, I discuss the importance of addressing bias, replicability, and data sharing concerns when using GLLMs. Taken together, this paper provides researchers, reviewers, and editors with the knowledge and tools to effectively use and evaluate GLLMs for academic research.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: Supported by the Foster School of Business – University of Washington.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03253 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using Side Information to Improve Decision Making Under UncertaintyIn many real-world planning settings, side information (also called covariate information, contextual information, or features) can be used to improve the estimates of uncertain parameters. Over the past decade, there has been growing interest in data-driven approaches to stochastic programming that take advantage of such side information. In “Data-Driven Sample Average Approximation with Covariate Information,” Kannan, Bayraksan, and Luedtke investigate two flexible data-driven frameworks that integrate a machine learning prediction model within a sample average approximation (SAA) of a stochastic programming problem, including a novel framework that leverages leave-one-out residuals for scenario generation. They establish conditions on the data generation process, the prediction model, and the stochastic program under which the solutions of these data-driven contextual SAAs exhibit asymptotic and finite sample convergence guarantees. Furthermore, they provide examples illustrating that these data-driven formulations can outperform existing methods in the limited data regime, even if the prediction model is misspecified.</content>

    <title>Multitask Learning and Bandits via Robust Statistics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Decision makers often simultaneously face many related but heterogeneous learning problems. For instance, a large retailer may wish to learn product demand at different stores to solve pricing or inventory problems, making it desirable to learn jointly for stores serving similar customers; alternatively, a hospital network may wish to learn patient risk at different providers to allocate personalized interventions, making it desirable to learn jointly for hospitals serving similar patient populations. Motivated by real data sets, we study a natural setting where the unknown parameter in each learning instance can be decomposed into a shared global parameter plus a sparse instance-specific term. We propose a novel two-stage multitask learning estimator that exploits this structure in a sample-efficient way, using a unique combination of robust statistics (to learn across similar instances) and LASSO regression (to debias the results). Our estimator yields improved sample complexity bounds in the feature dimension d relative to commonly employed estimators; this improvement is exponential for “data-poor” instances, which benefit the most from multitask learning. We illustrate the utility of these results for online learning by embedding our multitask estimator within simultaneous contextual bandit algorithms. We specify a dynamic calibration of our estimator to appropriately balance the bias-variance trade-off over time, improving the resulting regret bounds in the context dimension d. Finally, we illustrate the value of our approach on synthetic and real data sets.This paper was accepted by J. George Shanthikumar, data science.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00490 .</content>

    <title>Autistic Applicants’ Job Interview Experiences and Accommodation Preferences: An Intersectional Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although more organizations are seeking autistic applicants, autistic people remain in an unemployment crisis. This may be due in part to job interviews, which often implicitly evaluate relational and social skills—an area with which many autistic people struggle. To determine how to better support autistic applicants, we conduct a mixed methods study to identify, from their own perspective, the accommodations that would have the greatest impact on autistic individuals’ interview anxiety and performance. Additionally, we examine differences in interview anxiety and preferred adjustments to the interview process between both autistic and allistic participants and intersectionally across gender. Findings revealed additive effects of neurotype and gender on interview anxiety, with autistic participants reporting higher anxiety than allistic participants, and women reporting higher anxiety than men. Interestingly, despite a small number of notable differences, there were far more similarities between groups regarding preferred interview adjustments. These findings suggest that many adjustments to the interview process may be helpful across neurotypes, although they are perhaps particularly beneficial for alleviating the comparatively higher anxiety levels experienced by autistic applicants. Overall, there is a need to consider how and whether current interview best practices (e.g., standardization and structure) can be adapted to facilitate the inclusion of diverse neurotypes across a range of individual differences. As a starting point, we offer practical guidelines for managers wishing to improve the interview process for autistic and allistic applicants alike and set a foundation for future research.</content>

    <title>The Effect of U.S. Country‐by‐Country Reporting on U.S. Multinationals’ Tax‐Motivated Income Shifting and Real Activities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development introduced country‐by‐country reporting (CbCR) for multinational enterprises (MNEs) to help tax authorities combat tax‐motivated income shifting. This study uses confidential U.S. tax administrative data from 2011 to 2018 to examine the effect of U.S. CbCR adoption on the tax‐motivated income shifting and real activities of U.S. MNEs. We first document that while U.S. CbCR provides the Internal Revenue Service with incremental information about the location of U.S. MNEs’ global activities relative to existing U.S. tax return disclosures, substantial overlap exists between U.S. CbCR and existing disclosures. In contrast with prior CbCR studies in cross‐country settings, we fail to find evidence of a change in U.S. MNEs’ tax‐motivated income shifting or a reallocation of real activities based on tax incentives in response to U.S. CbCR using multiple empirical approaches. Overall, our study leverages U.S. tax administrative data to provide insights into the impact of the CbCR initiative on U.S. MNEs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate how audit firms balance the tension between professional responsibility and client service by examining changes in partner assignments following adverse internal control opinions (ICOs). We find that partners are significantly more likely to be reassigned when they issued an adverse ICO to any of their clients in the previous year. Further, partners issuing adverse ICOs experience unfavorable changes in their client portfolios in the form of lower fees and less prestigious assignments. We find that consequences are more negative when adverse ICOs are issued to clients that are more important to the local office and that there are no consequences when partners issue continuing adverse opinions to clients they have “inherited” from an original adverse ICO partner. We also find that the consequences are stronger for partners of non‐Big 4 audit firms that are likely to be more sensitive to client service considerations. The negative portfolio effects we observe persist for at least three years, and our findings are robust to restrictions involving mandatory partner rotation and adverse ICOs that lead to client loss. Overall, our results are consistent with adverse ICO partners experiencing negative consequences as audit firms respond to client service incentives in the area of internal controls over financial reporting.</content>

    <title>Short Squeezes After Short‐Selling Attacks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate the prevalence and drivers of short squeezes after short‐selling attacks. Positive returns after attacks have a disproportionate tendency to fully reverse and are accompanied by heightened short covering, consistent with the presence of short squeezes. We assess and find no support for non‐squeeze drivers of these positive return reversals and show they are more likely to be accompanied by squeeze‐related news articles, increased stock volatility, and disruptions in the stock lending market. Using positive return reversals as a proxy for short squeezes, we estimate that 15% of short attacks experience squeezes, and squeeze risk increases with short sellers’ visibility but decreases with the credibility of their evidence. Additionally, squeezes appear to be precipitated by actions of firms and investors, including insider purchases, share recalls, retail investor trading, and firm disclosures. Our findings quantify a material risk and check on activist short selling and are especially timely given recent proposed short‐selling restrictions.</content>

    <title>Groupthink in the Board of Family Firms: The Case of Institutional Investment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study explores groupthink on the boards of family firms. We conjecture that institutional investors, in the face of principal–principal agency issues, are discouraged by groupthink and consequently invest less in family firms. Appropriate corporate governance in the form of greater board diversity, lower director tenure, busier boards, more financial disclosure, and bigger shareholder voice should help in alleviating these institutional investor concerns. We examine a sample of firms from the S&amp;P 500 and find evidence consistent with these propositions. Also, we provide evidence that board generational heterogeneity in family firms exacerbates groupthink.</content>

    <title>Redesign of Virtual Power Plant-led Electricity Demand Response Program</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As the scale of renewable energy on the demand side continues to grow, a new demand response program (DRP), the virtual power plant (VPP), pays a rebate to the consumer and purchases his rooftop solar electricity. This electricity is dispatched to areas of electricity shortages, which is vital in balancing electricity loads and avoiding energy waste. However, the new DRP differs from the traditional DRP in terms of paying rebates. The traditional DRP requires consumers to respond above a specified baseline to receive a rebate. In contrast, in the new DRP, consumers can receive a rebate even if their response is small (i.e., no baseline). There is no research that addresses this divergence. Therefore, we construct a supply chain consisting of a consumer and a VPP for this novel DRP and analyze the strategic interactions between them in two situations where a baseline is not set/set. Our results show room for improvement in the DRP that dispatches electricity generated from rooftop solar. If the consumer generates more electricity from rooftop solar, the baseline, rather than frustrating the consumer, motivates the consumer to be more responsive. While the baseline also discourages the demand response process, it reduces the emissions generated from the consumer’s over-responsiveness. Additionally, our study suggests that a baseline, whether it facilitates or hinders the DRP, could benefit the VPP, depending on the business model of the VPP. In addition, we add several extensions to demonstrate the robustness of our model.</content>

    <title>On the Disclosure of Defensive Posture: Adversarial Belief Formation and Target Selection Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Due to the strategic and adaptive nature of adversaries, the deployment of new technologies is common practice in the arenas of security and defense (e.g., new baggage scanners at airports). History has shown that the deployment of these technologies has often been disclosed to the public, allowing malicious actors to potentially understand which venues are defended, and how. There is limited research examining how information disclosed about the deployment of new security measures can impact the beliefs and decisions of adversaries. Studying these beliefs and decisions is critical in obtaining insights into adversarial behavior, which can inform the allocation of defensive resources and the design of related information disclosures. This article aims to address this gap by studying how people—who are motivated to attack one among multiple targets—respond when receiving information from a defender regarding the deployment of new security measures at those targets. We address whether attackers (i) believe the information they receive from the defender and (ii) choose to attack after learning that new security measures may be deployed at their target(s) of interest. We find that attackers’ beliefs regarding where new security measures are deployed, and their decisions to attack particular targets, are impacted by the information they receive from the defender and by their understanding of the defender’s target valuations, highlighting the importance of strategic information disclosure in counterterrorism operations. In an experimental setting with two targets, when attackers ([Formula: see text]) knew that the defender valued one target much more than the other, they had a stronger belief that security measures would be deployed at the higher-value target, even when the defender announced that only the lower-valued target was protected with enhanced security. We also identify important factors that increase the likelihood of deterrence (i.e., when adversaries decide not to attack), which is a major goal in counterterrorism operations. Overall, this study provides novel insights into information disclosure and adversarial decision making in security and defense contexts, contributing to the operations management and behavioral decision analysis research in this domain.</content>

    <title>How to Leverage Digital Platforms in Preventing Industrial Accidents: Evidence from a Multi-Level Empirical Study</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The embeddedness of digital platforms in firms to improve industrial accident prevention performance remains a challenge for safety management. A pressing question exists regarding appropriate pathways to improve firm accident prevention performance by leveraging digital platforms. Prior research focuses on individual and organizational factors to prevent industrial accidents while ignoring information technology (IT) from a holistic perspective. Following a socio-technical lens, this study fills the research gap by proposing a new conceptualization of technical and institutional components and examining their combined effects in shaping individual and organizational accident prevention outcomes (i.e., employee accident prevention competence and firm accident prevention performance). Specifically, we introduce and conceptualize the concept of digital platform affordance to represent the technical component and theorize the external institutional force ( government pressure) and the internal human agency ( top management support) as the institutional components of digital platforms. By integrating the socio-technical lens, IT affordance theory, and institutional theory, we develop a theoretical model to examine the interaction effects between digital platform affordance, government pressure, and top management support on accident prevention performance. We conduct a multilevel modeling approach to test the proposed research model using a fine-grained matched-pair survey from multiple respondents (i.e., employees and safety executives) in 161 industrial firms in China. We find that digital platform affordance enhances firm accident prevention performance by improving employee accident prevention competence. The results also indicate that the magnitude of the moderating effect of government pressure is contingent upon top management support. This study conceptualizes and assesses the role of digital platforms in safety management and indicates that the amalgamation of their technical/institutional components is a promising means to prevent industrial accidents. We also provide a new perspective for Operations Management scholars to reinterpret the socio-technical lens in the emerging digitally enabled safety management subdiscipline.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the operations of a novel service model, mobile charging, in which an e-commerce platform operator dispatches trucks equipped with charging piles to provide charging services for customers’ electric vehicles with low battery levels. We model the platform-customer interaction with a Stackelberg game and explicitly characterize customers’ optimal charging decisions under the platform’s various service plans. In a general scenario that involves charging requests within a transportation network, we develop a joint optimization model for the platform’s pricing and service fulfillment, utilizing an elaborately constructed augmented network. In addition, we explore a localized subproblem where multiple orders are concentrated within a specific region. With a simplified model structure, we propose an approximation algorithm with provable performance guarantees and further theoretically evaluate the resource consumption and associated platform benefits for serving the orders in each region. The results enable the batching of neighboring demands within the general scenario as a specialized node, resulting in a streamlined network with fewer nodes. Additionally, we can enhance the algorithm’s efficiency within the general framework through strategic prioritization of node visitations, leveraging the analytical findings. Furthermore, the insights derived can offer recommendations for the deployment of mobile charging and the selection of target areas in the initial stages. Overall, our study provides comprehensive guidelines and valuable insights for mobile charging operations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dynamic treatment regimes improve health outcomes by tailoring each treatment to a patient’s evolving condition, but they also allow providers to learn and game the system over time. How should insurers pay? We study this new class of reimbursement problems, where the provider can privately learn and manipulate the progression of the patient’s condition. (i) We characterize the optimal payment policy: it internalizes two intertemporal effects of each treatment, and rewards provider honesty with incentive pay; moreover, it admits a simple implementation of risk-adjusted cost-sharing policy. (ii) We show that, ignoring dynamic learning and gaming, the existing payment models may have overestimated the harm of information asymmetry. Using the optimal policy, insurers only need to pay for initial private information; they can exploit provider uncertainty and elicit future private information at no cost. (iii) Our study informs U.S. healthcare payment reform with new insights; using two sets of real data, our study also quantifies when and why the optimal policy outperforms the existing ones. By highlighting the critical role of dynamic learning and gaming, this study advances our understanding of healthcare payment theory and practice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Offering bespoke products is the cornerstone of many competitive manufacturing strategies. The challenge for production control is allocating materials to individualized orders before they can be released to the shop floor. This requires joint evaluation of material inventory and workload control. However, these topics have been studied in isolation for [Formula: see text] years, under the presumption of a hierarchical control design. This traditionally had the practical advantage of a reduced need for real-time system information. With the advancements in Industry 4.0, control functions can now be integrated. We amalgamate knowledge from both disciplines, present hierarchical and integrated production control designs, and formulate material inventory policies tailored to pulled order release. Using simulation, we show that a decentralized and integrated production control design drastically reduces cost (at least 15%) and improves delivery performance in various settings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using sociotechnical systems (STS) theory, this article offers a critical perspective on how the interplay between social and technical systems in supply chains can be leveraged to gain valuable insights into addressing risks related to modern slavery. It elaborates on the complex recursive interactions among various elements of STS, shedding light on the emergence, perpetuation, and diffusion of modern slavery, as well as the sociotechnical interventions available within supply chains. We develop a framework that conceptualizes the risk of modern slavery as the outcome of interactions among multiple systems, providing guidance for future research, policy development, and managerial strategies to address this pressing societal challenge. Importantly, multistakeholder initiatives, combining innovative approaches to both social and technical governance, are expected to play a crucial role in mitigating modern slavery risks.</content>

    <title>Markovian Pricing With Price Guarantees</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A stream of recent research considers the practice of random price discounts (a.k.a randomized pricing) when selling to forward-looking customers and shows that such pricing strategies can mitigate strategic customer waiting and boost seller profit. In practice, random price discounts are often offered together with price guarantees, in which customers are refunded the price difference if the price is lowered within a given time window after purchase. This paper investigates the efficacy of price guarantees under randomized pricing. To that end, we consider a model in which a firm adopts Markovian pricing and interacts with customers over an infinite time horizon. The following results are obtained. First, while Markovian pricing allows firms to price discriminate customers based on their monitoring costs, price guarantees further allow firms to price discriminate customers based on their willingness to pay. Second, offering price guarantees under Markovian pricing can help retain customers effectively by inducing high-valuation customers to purchase early, regardless of their arrival time. Third, even with price guarantees, Markovian pricing can dominate static pricing only when high-valuation customers are more likely to have a high monitoring cost, which illustrates that customer composition plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of the firm’s pricing strategy. Fourth, the optimal duration of price guarantees is closely related to customers’ lifetime duration. Finally, perhaps surprisingly, offering price guarantees can decrease the aggregate customer surplus since the firm offers sale prices less often under price guarantees.</content>

    <title>How Psychological Barriers Constrain Men’s Interest in Gender-Atypical Jobs and Facilitate Occupational Segregation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scholarship regarding occupational gender segregation has almost exclusively focused on women’s experiences (e.g., as targets of discrimination in masculine domains), yet understanding factors that perpetuate men’s underrepresentation in traditionally feminine occupations is equally important. We examine a consequential dynamic early in the job search process in which individuals come to learn that an occupation that fits them is perceived as feminine versus masculine. Our research develops and tests the prediction that femininity or masculinity of occupations will exert a stronger impact on men’s (versus women’s) interest in them such that men will be less interested in gender-atypical occupations than women. Across five studies (n = 4,477), we consistently observed robust evidence for this prediction among diverse samples, including high school students (Study 1), unemployed job seekers (Study 2), U.S. adults (Study 3), and undergraduates (Study 4) and using experimental and archival methods. We observed this asymmetry after controlling for alternative accounts related to economic factors (e.g., expected salary), suggesting that they alone cannot fully explain men’s lack of interest in feminine occupations as previously discussed in the literature. Further, we consistently observed that men, compared with women, show heightened sensitivity to gender-based occupational status, and this greater sensitivity explains men’s (versus women’s) reduced interest in gender-atypical occupations. Though past scholarship suggests that increasing pay is key to stoking men’s interest in feminine occupations, our research suggests that targeting men’s underlying psychological concern—sensitivity to gender-based occupational status—may be an underappreciated pathway to reducing gender segregation.Supplemental Material: The data, materials, preregistration, and ancillary analyses for all studies are available at https://osf.io/h4mgx/?view_only=9a4dbfc9d122417c880354d6b3462072 and at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17550 .</content>

    <title>Joint Bottom-up Method for Probabilistic Forecasting of Hierarchical Time Series</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a stark departure from conventional wisdom, Nicolò Bertani, Shane T. Jensen, and Ville A. Satopää’s recently published research article titled “Joint Bottom-up Method for Probabilistic Forecasting of Hierarchical Time Series” dismantles a long-held belief in hierarchical forecasting: that the hierarchical structure itself contains vital information. The joint bottom-up (JBU) method proves otherwise. The authors demonstrate that the sums within a hierarchy—often seen as critical—add no additional information beyond what is contained in the most granular, bottom-level series. By modeling these bottom-level series jointly, JBU leverages their dependencies to deliver probabilistic forecasts that are both coherent and highly accurate across all levels of aggregation. This groundbreaking insight challenges decades of hierarchical forecasting practices. It underscores that upper-level series can be entirely reconstructed from the bottom-level series, rendering the hierarchy redundant. This finding, validated through real-world applications, sets a new standard for forecasting in fields like retail, energy, and tourism. Explore the full study to understand its far-reaching implications.</content>

    <title>Things at Work: How Things Contribute to Performing Work</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A crucial question for organizations is what constitutes work performance. While the importance of human competence and motivation to work performance has been established, less well understood is how ‘things’ – such as algorithms, tools, instruments, and raw materials – contribute to work performance. As ‘intelligent’ and ‘agentic’ technologies become further involved in work, it is increasingly important to understand the impact of things upon work performance. Although research adopting an entanglement perspective (e.g., practice theory, sociomateriality, affordances, science and technology studies) has convincingly demonstrated things are integral to work performance, there is a need for heightened clarity onhowthings contribute to performing work. Informed by an ontology of things and drawing on an ethnographic study in the biotechnology industry, we propose things are constitutive of work performance in three interrelated ways: (1) by belonging to a nexus of useful things, (2) through performing interlinked roles, and (3) while co‐constituting work performance in concert with practitioners. Our theoretical and empirical account offers a moreintegrativeandcomprehensive understandingof how things are constitutive of work performance compared to the existing entanglement literature. This opens several new possibilities for enhancing work performance in organizations, which we outline in the paper.</content>

    <title>On the Folly of Rewarding Your Version of Performance: Signaling and the Double Empathy Problem in Pay‐For‐Performance Across Neurotypes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As many organizations have sought to increase their neurodiversity, they have tended to focus on human resource (HR) practices and programs for increasing representation, especially of autistic employees. There has been comparatively less attention regarding HR practices that relate to sustaining employment and fostering workplace performance for autistic employees. Sustaining employment is a particular challenge because the signals sent by HR practices and the neurotypical managers implementing them are often differently interpreted by autistic employees—the double empathy problem. As the pay practices and pay‐for‐performance (PFP) systems critical to retention and career advancement have increasingly broadened beyond objective assessments of task performance to include more subjective assessments and contextual performance, the double empathy problem can worsen leading to unintended negative consequences. We draw upon signaling theory to theorize how and when PFP worsens or mitigates the double empathy problem. Specifically, we develop a model and set of propositions that posit how the attributes of signals (observability, consistency, and frequency), the resulting shared relevance of signals, their effects on behavior, and managers' subsequent interpretations of employee behavior and performance form a cycle through which performance‐reward signals tighten or loosen and, in turn, affect autistic employee well‐being and turnover. We close by discussing how our model may apply to other forms of neurodivergence and implications for future research regarding the practices, signals, and interpretations that create or inhibit environments supportive of neurodiversity.</content>

    <title>Finite Sample Inference for the Maximum Score Estimand</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a finite sample inference method for the structural parameters of the semiparametric binary response model under a conditional median restriction originally studied by Manski (1975, 1985). This is achieved by exploiting distributional properties of observable outcomes conditional on the observed sequence of exogenous variables. Moment inequalities conditional on the size n sequence of exogenous covariates are constructed, and the proposed test statistic is a monotone function of violations of the corresponding sample moment inequalities. The critical value used for inference is provided by the appropriate quantile of a known function of n independent Bernoulli random variables, and does not require the use of a cube root asymptotic approximation employing a point estimator of the target parameter. Simulation studies demonstrate favorable finite sample performance of the test in comparison to several existing approaches. Empirical use is illustrated with an application to the classical setting of transportation choice.</content>

    <title>Tracking Truth with Liquid Democracy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The dynamics of random transitive delegations on a graph are of particular interest when viewed through the lens of an emerging voting paradigm: liquid democracy. This paradigm allows voters to choose between directly voting and transitively delegating their votes to other voters so that those selected cast a vote weighted by the number of delegations that they received. In the epistemic setting, where voters decide on a binary issue for which there is a ground truth, previous work showed that a few voters may amass such a large amount of influence that liquid democracy is less likely to identify the ground truth than direct voting. We quantify the amount of permissible concentration of power and examine more realistic delegation models, showing that they behave well by ensuring that (with high probability) there is a permissible limit on the maximum number of delegations received. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the delegation process is similar to well-known processes on random graphs that are sufficiently bounded for our purposes. Along the way, we prove new bounds on the size of the largest component in an infinite Pólya urn process, which may be of independent interest. In addition, we empirically validate the theoretical results, running six experiments (for a total of N = 168 participants, 62 delegation graphs, and over 11,000 votes collected). We find that empirical delegation behaviors meet the conditions for our positive theoretical guarantees. Overall, our work alleviates concerns raised about liquid democracy and bolsters the case for the applicability of this emerging paradigm.This paper was accepted by Martin Bichler, market design, platform, and demand analytics.Funding: This work was supported by the Michael Hammer Fellowship, the Office of Naval Research [2016 Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, 2020 ONR Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, and Grant N00014-20-1-2488], the Office of Secretary of Defense [Grants ARO MURI W911NF-19-0217 and ARO W911NF-17-1-0592], Simons [Investigator Award 622132], the Open Philanthropy Foundation, and the National Science Foundation [Grants IIS-178108, CCF-1733556, CCF-1918421, CCF-2007080, IIS-1703846, and IIS-2024287].

    <title>Timing Complex News to Target Attention</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Investors have limited and time-varying attention. These constraints are heterogeneous across investors, which can create asymmetric information and adverse selection problems. We show how firms take these constraints into account: They release harder-to-process news in periods when investor attention is higher. We use an institutional discontinuity within the U.S. corporate filing system to measure these effects. Filings before 5:30 p.m. become available immediately, whereas filings after 5:30 p.m. only become visible the next morning and attract less attention. Firms release longer and more complex news just before the cutoff, giving investors the longest possible period to absorb the information before markets open. Firms experience faster price convergence and more liquidity after precutoff news despite their complexity, which is consistent with the additional attention that they attract. We outline a framework in which the need for investors to spread their attention across different ideas induces firms to file their more complex filings at times when investor attention is higher. Our results are consistent with an equilibrium in which investors pay more attention to complex news and in which firms with complex news time them to target investor attention.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03722 .</content>

    <title>Investor Perceptions of the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Inflation Reduction Act establishes a new 15% corporate minimum tax on the adjusted financial accounting income for large U.S. corporations. Although the minimum tax is estimated to raise $222 billion over 10 years, some fear firms will manipulate their accounting earnings to reduce their tax liabilities, resulting in less revenue raised. Using an event study, we examine the extent to which investors believe this tax will reduce firm value. We examine stock market reactions around key legislative developments leading to the enactment of the book minimum tax. Our findings show targeted firms experience significantly lower stock returns than nontargeted firms during the enactment process (about 1.4%–1.8% of firm value). In aggregate, our findings are consistent with the Joint Committee on Taxation’s revenue estimates. In cross-sectional tests, we fail to find evidence that firms most likely to avoid the tax via earnings management experience more positive returns. We also fail to find less negative returns for firms most likely to pass on the tax to consumers. Overall, our results suggest investors do not expect firms to avoid this tax. Instead, they appear to expect a significant portion of the corporate minimum tax to be remitted by firms and borne by shareholders.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: F.

    <title>The High Cost of Cheap Talk: How Disingenuous Ethical Language Can Reflect Agency Costs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does the use of a certain type of ethical language indicate that managers are failing to behave in a socially responsible manner? Managers are increasingly using language related to ethics, values, and corporate purpose in their communications with stakeholders. However, while economic models argue that “talk is cheap,” we predict that some ethical language (i.e., cheap talk) can reflect agency costs. That is, cheap talk reflects managers being disingenuous with stakeholders about their ethical intentions in order to reduce pressure on corporate social performance (CSP). We test this prediction by inductively creating a dictionary of cheap talk words and demonstrating that the use of cheap talk in annual reports (10-Ks) is associated with decreasing CSP. We also examine how monitoring by stakeholders concerned about CSP (specifically, security analysts and women board membership) can reduce this effect, and how certain types of executive compensation (specifically, exercisable and non-exercisable options) can either alleviate or worsen this effect. We contribute to the cheap talk literature (a subset of the impression management literature) by showing the high cost of disingenuous ethical language (i.e., cheap talk). We also add to the literature distinguishing between “values” and “legal” ethical talk by showing in post hoc analyses that words reflecting values are more likely to be cheap talk.</content>

    <title>Silent Suffering: Using Machine Learning to Measure CEO Depression</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a novel measure of CEO depression by applying machine learning models that analyze vocal acoustic features from CEOs' conference call recordings. Our research was preregistered via theJournal of Accounting Research's registration‐based editorial process. In this study, we validate this measure and examine associated factors. We find that greater firm risk is positively associated with CEO depression, whereas higher job demands are negatively associated with CEO depression. Female and older CEOs show a lower likelihood of depression. Using this novel measure, we then explore the relationship between CEO depression and career outcomes. Although we do not find any evidence that CEO depression is associated with CEO turnover, we find some evidence that turnover‐performance sensitivity is higher among depressed CEOs. We also find limited evidence of higher compensation and higher pay‐performance sensitivity for depressed CEOs. This study provides new insights into the relationship between CEO mental health and career outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using new SEC data, we study fund derivative use and its impact on performance. Despite small portfolio weights, derivatives contribute largely to fund returns. Contrary to prior research, we find most employ derivatives to amplify, not hedge, equity returns. Using machine learning to classify funds’ derivative strategies reveals high specializations linked to information-related trading, liquidity management, gaining exposure, or hedging motives. Long index derivative users drive the amplification. During COVID-19, these users significantly increased derivative use more than others and shifted strategies, but initially lost on existing positions and then on newly opened short positions when markets unexpectedly rebounded.

    <title>Inference with a Single Treated Cluster</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I introduce a generic method for inference about a scalar parameter in research designs with a finite number of heterogeneous clusters where only a single cluster received treatment. This situation is commonplace in difference-in-differences estimation but the test developed here applies more broadly. I show that the test controls size and has power under asymptotics where the number of observations within each cluster is large but the number of clusters is fixed. The test combines weighted, approximately Gaussian parameter estimates with a rearrangement procedure to obtain its critical values. The weights needed for most empirically relevant situations are tabulated in the paper. Calculation of the critical values is computationally simple and does not require simulation or resampling. The rearrangement test is highly robust to situations where some clusters are much more variable than others. Examples and an empirical application are provided.</content>

    <title>DOES A THEORY-OF-VALUE ADD VALUE? EVIDENCE FROM A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL WITH TANZANIAN ENTREPRENEURS</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs making decisions under uncertainty are encouraged to evaluate their initial ideas through hypothesis testing, but entrepreneurial approaches vary in their emphasis on ex-ante theory development prior to collecting evidence. In this paper, we examine whether and how entrepreneurs benefit from adopting an evidence-based approach or a theory-and-evidence-based approach to decision-making. We conducted a field experiment with Tanzanian agribusiness entrepreneurs by randomly assigning entrepreneurs to two different training conditions. We find that entrepreneurs in the theory-and-evidence-based condition have higher economic performance during the observation period following the intervention. We conjecture this result stems from differences in the types of changes enacted: entrepreneurs in the theory-and-evidence-based training make more coordinated changes that encompass both core and operational elements of their business models.</content>

    <title>How Social Movements Catalyze Firm Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the impact social movements have on firm innovation through private politics. We argue that firms strategically respond to private politics by investing in new technologies that address movement-advocated issues material to firms’ performance. While both contentious private politics—when activists contentiously target firms—and cooperative private politics—when activists and firms collaborate—catalyze innovation, they do so in different ways. Contentious private politics increases the amount of innovation firms undertake by drawing managerial attention to movement-advocated issues material to the firm prompting search for solutions to those issues. Conversely, cooperative private politics provides firms access to new knowledge which encourages firms to search for solutions in areas more distant from their existing knowledge, in so doing, increase innovation involving distant recombination on material issues. We find support for our arguments in a matched sample of firms contentiously targeted, and with activist collaborations, on climate change issues, and firms that were not targets of private politics on those issues but had otherwise similar histories of climate-related innovation and relationships with climate movements and other environmental movements. Supplementary analyses corroborate the mechanisms that undergird our theoretical predictions: contentious private politics is associated more innovation closer to a firm’s expertise while cooperative private politics is associated with innovations that draw on more distant knowledge. We also find that when collaboration follows contention their respective impacts on innovation are reduced which may result from firms seeking collaborations for their legitimacy-granting benefits after contention rather than the learning opportunities they offer.</content>

    <title>Where A/B Testing Goes Wrong: How Divergent Delivery Affects What Online Experiments Cannot (and Can) Tell You About How Customers Respond to Advertising</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Marketers use online advertising platforms to compare user responses to different ad content. But platforms’ experimentation tools deliver different ads to distinct and undetectably optimized mixes of users that vary across ads, even during the test. Because expo­sure to ads in the test is nonrandom, the estimated comparisons confound the effect of the ad content with the effect of algorithmic targeting. This means that experimenters may not be learning what they think they are learning from ad A/B tests. The authors document these “divergent delivery” patterns during an online experiment for the first time. They explain how algorithmic targeting, user heterogeneity, and data aggregation conspire to confound the magnitude, and even the sign, of ad A/B test results. Analytically, the authors extend the potential outcomes model of causal inference to treat random assignment of ads and user exposure to ads as separate experimental design elements. Managerially, the authors explain why platforms lack incentives to allow experimenters to untangle the effects of ad content from proprietary algorithmic selection of users when running A/B tests. Given that experimenters have diverse reasons for comparing user responses to ads, the au­thors offer tailored prescriptive guidance to experimenters based on their specific goals.</content>

    <title>AI–Human Hybrids for Marketing Research: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as Collaborators</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The authors’ central premise is that a human–LLM (large language model) hybrid approach leads to efficiency and effectiveness gains in the marketing research process. In qualitative research, they show that LLMs can assist in both data generation and analysis; LLMs effectively create sample characteristics, generate synthetic respondents, and conduct and moderate in-depth interviews. The AI–human hybrid generates information-rich, coherent data that surpasses human-only data in depth and insightfulness and matches human performance in data analysis tasks of generating themes and summaries. Evidence from expert judges shows that humans and LLMs possess complementary skills; the human–LLM hybrid outperforms its human-only or LLM-only counterpart. For quantitative research, the LLM correctly picks the answer direction and valence, with the quality of synthetic data significantly improving through few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation. The authors demonstrate the value of the AI–human hybrid by collaborating with a Fortune 500 food company and replicating a 2019 qualitative and quantitative study using GPT-4. For their empirical investigation, the authors design the system architecture and prompts to create personas, ask questions, and obtain responses from synthetic respondents. They provide road maps for integrating LLMs into qualitative and quantitative marketing research and conclude that LLMs serve as valuable collaborators in the insight generation process.</content>

    <title>Inscribing Impact: Measurement Practices in the Making of Moral Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Moral markets, designed to generate positive impact on pressing social and environmental challenges, are transforming traditional market practices by including more than economic considerations in their operations. The importance of these markets continues to grow as investors, regulators, and consumers increasingly put pressure on companies to account for their broader social and environmental impacts. However, the absence of standardized norms and tools to measure impact may erode trust and lead to ‘impact washing’. This paper examines the process of impact inscription – how actors embed their principles, objectives, and values into artefacts such as measurement tools that shape moral market practices. Drawing on qualitative, in‐depth data from Spain's emerging impact investing market, we unpack impact inscription and identify three key mechanisms: demarcating moral market boundaries, accounting for social issues, and redefining governance structures. By driving changes in scope, roles, and incentives, these mechanisms influence the emergence of moral markets and can result in either disruptive change (with the risk of paralysis) or incremental change (with the risk of goal displacement). Our study also prompts a deeper reflection on how measurement tools embed value judgments, shaping how markets internalize social and environmental externalities and integrate them into market exchanges.</content>

    <title>Redaction as Cross‐Regulatory Disclosure Avoidance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce the idea of cross‐regulatory disclosure avoidance, whereby firms attempt to counteract expansions of disclosure under one regulation through actions that reduce disclosure under a different one. We study whether firms redact information from material contracts when they face new rules to disclose segment information. Using SFAS No. 131 as a plausibly exogenous shock to segment disclosure, we find that firms increasing the number of reported segments after the rule change exhibit a greater increase in redaction than firms maintaining the same number of segments. Consistent with proprietary cost motives, the increases are concentrated among firms with greater divergence in profitability across segments, higher abnormal segment profitability, and more negative abnormal stock returns in response to the finalization of the rule. Also, treated firms that redact after the rule change have abnormally profitable segments that they previously did not disclose. Firms that observables predict would increase redaction but did not experience declines in sales growth and profit margin. We find no evidence that agency cost motives drive the increases in redaction or, more generally, nondisclosure of segment performance before SFAS No. 131.</content>
