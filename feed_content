    <title>On Resource Complementarity Among Startups, Accelerators, and Financial Investors: A Large-Scale Analysis of Sorting and Value Creation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a theoretical framework and provide empirical evidence on how resource complementarity or substitutability between entrepreneurs and seed investors drives selection and value creation in the context of high-tech startups. Specifically, we argue that seed investors specialized in training programs—startup accelerators—are the ideal match for entrepreneurial teams equipped with strong technological competencies but lacking business knowledge. On the other hand, when entrepreneurs with extensive business knowledge pair up with accelerators, the value created is typically less. Combining information from Crunchbase and LinkedIn, we provide robust empirical evidence based on the assortative matching of start-ups and investors and the ex- post analysis of joint value creation.Funding: S.

    <title>Can Stereotype Reactance Prompt Women to Compete? A Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Women are consistently underrepresented in leadership roles. One contributor may be that women are generally less willing than equally-qualified men to enter competitions (e.g., for jobs or promotions). We draw from research on “stereotype reactance”—the idea that telling people about stereotyped expectations can encourage defiance—to propose and test whether telling women about the gender gap in competition entry can increase their willingness to compete. Our prediction contrasts with prior work on stereotype threat and descriptive norms suggesting that highlighting the gender competition gap might lead women to refrain from competing. In two incentive-compatible, preregistered online experiments, we find that informing women about the gender competition gap increases their likelihood of competing for higher pay, and this effect is mediated by stereotype reactance, consistent with our theorizing. Moreover, exposing both men and women to information about the gender competition gap closes the gap. We then test this informational intervention in a large-scale field experiment on an executive job search platform (n = 4,245), examining whether telling women about the gender competition gap increases their willingness to compete for leadership roles relative to a control message that tells them about an identity-irrelevant competition gap. We find that relative to our control message, informing women about the gender gap in willingness to compete increases submitted job applications by over 20% on the day of condition assignment. This suggests that women’s willingness to compete is affected not just by confidence, but also by cultural expectations and motivation to defy stereotypical norms.Funding: The authors thank the Wharton School (and in particular, the Wharton Behavioral Laboratory and Analytics at Wharton) for funding support.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.19563 .</content>

    <title>Online Learning with Sample Selection Bias</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Personalized recommendation systems often face the challenge of making optimal decisions when user preferences are unknown, and outcomes are only observed if users engage with the platform (e.g., clicking a recommendation). In their paper, “Online Learning with Sample Selection Bias,” Singhvi and Singhvi study this problem in the context of sequential decision making, where the censoring of outcomes leads to selection bias. Ignoring this bias results in suboptimal recommendations and linear regret, even for well-performing existing learning algorithms. To address this, they propose the sample selection bandit (SSB) algorithm, which combines Heckman’s two-step estimator with the “optimism under uncertainty” principle. The authors also demonstrate that SSB achieves a near-optimal regret rate. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real-world donation data confirm that SSB significantly outperforms existing algorithms, effectively addressing selection bias while improving recommendations and outcomes in practical settings.</content>

    <title>Consequences of Performance-Enhancing Misconduct: Insights from Professional Road Cycling, 2000–2010</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore the career consequences experienced by professional cyclists implicated in performance-enhancing drug use as well the spillover effects experienced by their teammates and managers using a data set that observes members of all teams from 2000 to 2011. Our data captures publicly known doping implications that range from informal suspicions published in the media to formal convictions by antidoping and law enforcement authorities. Our unique setting, characterized by expectations of widespread doping despite a rigorous antidoping regulatory regime and close media scrutiny, provides a new perspective on the multilayered ways that actors in competitive industries assess the competing demands of extreme performance pressures versus playing by the rules. We find that only the most severe rules violations are associated with career interruptions for riders, whereas lesser offenses are not. More ambiguous cases of doping, those based on informal suspicion or moderately punished formal convictions, are associated with career interruptions primarily for the sport’s high-performing stars. In contrast to most prior work on spillover effects from peer misconduct, we find that most riders are at a lower risk of career interruptions following teammates’ doping convictions—an effect we attribute to a vetting process in which regulators proactively target peers for increased monitoring, which resolves uncertainties about peers’ doping. Regarding spillover effects on managers’ careers, we find that only extreme levels of formal convictions that signal major team scandals are associated with increased risk of managerial career interruptions. Together, our results suggest an industry-level incentive structure that supports widespread misconduct in a competitive industry despite rigorous monitoring and enforcement.This paper was accepted by Lamar Pierce, organizations.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03681 .</content>

    <title>Estimation Using Marginal Competitor Sales Information</title>
    <updated>2025-03-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An abiding preoccupation for firms is understanding how customers value their products versus competitors' products. This is difficult to quantify and estimate from data as, even if competitor prices are public information, their sales are typically unobservable. However, in some industries, most prominently the hotel industry, third‐party information brokers collect and supply aggregate competitor sales information. In the hotel industry, these reports from Smith Travel Research, popularly known as STR reports, are widely subscribed to. Hotels participate by reporting their sales information and, in turn, obtain access to marginal competitor sales data, in the form of daily occupancy percentage, albeit aggregated across groups and lengths‐of‐stay. Despite its availability, this data is not widely incorporated into revenue management estimation, likely due to the lack of robust models and methodologies. In this paper, focusing mainly on the hotel industry, we develop a constrained maximum likelihood method (constrained by moment conditions) to overcome the following significant challenges in estimation of a market share model with a competitor attractiveness factor: (i) competitor data is aggregated across multiple lengths‐of‐stay with varying demand characteristics; (ii) no‐purchase data is unobservable, preventing tracking of customers who choose neither the focal firm's (we refer to as our) product nor the competitor's product; (iii) private (unobserved) group sales of competitors prior to retail sales reduce competitor capacity and influence their subsequent prices; and finally, (iv) maximizing the partial‐information likelihood function is intractable. We first evaluate our method through Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic data generated under a generalized Nash competition model. In these simulations, our method accurately recovers the true parameters to a close degree in almost all cases, exploiting the marginal competitor data. Next, we apply the method to real‐world hotel booking data and benchmark its performance against alternative approaches from the network tomography and revenue management literature.</content>

    <title>How Group Consumption Affects Coupon Acquisition and Redemption: The Moderating Role of Offline Agglomeration in Online Group Buying</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Local merchants have implemented coupon promotions to attract consumer traffic and improve product sales. Drawing upon signaling theory, this paper examines how a social characteristic of a coupon (i.e., group consumption) influences coupon acquisition and subsequent coupon redemption, along with how such relationships are further influenced by offline agglomeration (i.e., density and product agglomeration). Specifically, we argue that group consumption increases coupon acquisition, which in turn increases coupon redemption, with coupon acquisition serving as a mediator in the relationship. These relationships, however, are contingent upon offline agglomeration signals. Using a large panel data set from a prominent group buying platform, we collect 121,909 observations to test our theoretical model. The findings reveal a positive relationship between group consumption and coupon acquisition and a positive relationship between coupon acquisition and redemption, while the relationship between group consumption and coupon redemption is fully mediated by coupon acquisition. Furthermore, we find that the effect of group consumption on coupon acquisition is strengthened by density agglomeration but attenuated by product agglomeration. The effect of coupon acquisition on redemption is reinforced by density agglomeration. These findings offer valuable implications for local merchants who are seeking to optimize their coupon promotions.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Side‐Hustle Thriving on Full‐Time Work Performance: A Conservation of Resources Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise of digital labour platforms has made side‐hustles a defining feature of modern work. The debate over whether side‐hustles benefit or burden full‐time work remains unresolved. We propose side‐hustle thriving as a key factor. Drawing on the conservation of resources theory, we theorize dual pathways: Side‐hustle thriving enhances full‐time work performance through psychological detachment from and affective well‐being within employees' full‐time roles (resource gain), yet simultaneously impairs it via side‐hustle attention residue and full‐time work resource depletion (resource depletion). Two studies, one with 10‐day experience sampling (N = 97, 644 observations) and another with a multisource, multiwave design (N = 247), support this framework. Crucially, we identify boundary segmentation preference between side‐hustles and full‐time work as a key moderator: Employees who strongly separate work domains amplify the resource gain pathway while mitigating resource depletion. This research offers a nuanced framework for managing multiple jobholding in the gig economy era.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a unique data set of firms listed on China’s Shenzhen Stock Exchange, we show that investors’ corporate site visits convey information about future stock returns. Firms with abnormally frequent investor visits predictably outperform firms with abnormally infrequent investor visits by approximately 70-to-100 basis points per month. This return predictability concentrates on neglected firms with low trading volumes and when investors incur higher travel costs. Abnormally frequent investor visits accompany increased holdings among visiting institutions and predict improvements in firms’ fundamental performance, consistent with institutions using visits to gain an information advantage regarding underpriced firms.The significance of conducting site visits and in-depth research by fund companies is to consistently deliver stable and substantial returns to clients through professional expertise.

    <title>Limits to Political Capture: Evidence from Patent Grants, Disclosures, and Litigation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Substantial evidence suggests that regulatory agencies in the United States can be captured by the politicians who oversee them. We provide novel evidence of a federal agency in which capture is limited: the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Although patent applications from politically connected applicants are slightly more likely to be approved despite being of lower ex post quality, additional analyses suggest these outcomes are not indicative of capture. In particular, the disclosure quality of connected patents' legal claims increases more than unconnected patents during the review process, narrowing the scope of the patents and constraining the intellectual property rights. Furthermore, connected patents are no more likely than others to be litigated ex post, suggesting these patent grants are not spurious. Our findings provide insights into how the design of a regulator can limit the benefits that accrue to politically connected firms.</content>

    <title>The Death of a Technical Skill</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For managers, we show that opportunities for skill development strongly influence matching in online information technology (IT) markets. Employers cannot easily circumvent labor scarcity by adopting older technologies, as workers avoid projects with declining future skill value absent substantial wage premiums. However, older workers, having shorter career horizons, are less sensitive to declining skill value, suggesting potential benefits in matching them with legacy technologies. For policy makers, our research demonstrates that labor market tightness persists across both new and old technologies in online IT markets. This challenges the notion that employers can engage in labor arbitrage by avoiding cutting-edge technologies. Policy frameworks therefore need flexibility to address skill shortages wherever they emerge. Additionally, our findings highlight the need for more granular data collection on technical skill evolution beyond broad occupational categories. Our online context provides unique insights into how corporate decisions about technology standards cascade into labor markets. The findings underscore the importance of policies promoting continuous learning and adaptability, while suggesting that age-diverse hiring practices could help address both skill shortages and age discrimination concerns in technical fields.</content>

    <title>Organizational Burden or Catalyst for Ideas? Disability as a Driver of Cognitive Flexibility and Creativity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Disability is typically perceived negatively, and employees with a disability are viewed as a burden that requires accommodation. We draw from creativity theory to challenge this view and propose that disability can make workplace imperfections salient, can function as a situational cue that increases coworkers’ cognitive flexibility, and thus can be a catalyst for creativity. We apply a multi-study, multi-method approach to test these predictions. First, results from time-lagged and objective data in a sample of 7,037 employees from 425 units of a large German car manufacturer show that units with people with disabilities generate more ideas, particularly when employees engage in perspective taking. Second, an experiment with 954 employees shows that having a colleague with a disability has a positive individual-level effect on idea generation. Third, we extend these findings with a full model test in a second experiment of 1,314 employees, which shows that having a colleague with a disability (compared to not having a colleague with a disability) leads to more idea generation and higher idea novelty. Increased cognitive flexibility mediates these effects. Together, our findings contribute to the disability, diversity, and creativity literatures by integrating disability and creativity theory and showing that disability has the potential to serve as a catalyst for creativity and, ultimately, innovation.</content>

    <title>Future Making: Towards a Practice Perspective</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Management scholars are increasingly interested in ‘future making’, observing and theorizing how organizational actors produce and enact the yet‐to‐come. However, the rapid growth of the conversation runs the risk of emptying the notion of future making, calling into question its meaning and relevance. In response to these concerns, ourPointis that there is value in understanding future making from a practice perspective. A practice perspective, we argue, is empirically sufficiently open to account for the plurality and open‐endedness of futures and future making amidst the continual emergence of interrelated crises, large‐scale challenges, and intractable technologies. Thus, it reinforces the relevance of research on future making as a central part of contemporary organizational life. At the same time, the four practice‐based dimensions elaborated in thisPointprovide sufficient conceptual specificity to discern what counts as future making and what does not, thereby providing solid ground for cumulative theory‐building and research in this area. OurPointextends research on future making in management studies by substantiating the relevance of examining and theorizing future making, and by articulating and clarifying a practice perspective on future making that directs scholarly attention to important areas for future research.</content>

    <title>The Mixed Gamble of Competitive Dynamics in Family‐Controlled Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We extend the mixed gamble perspective to explain how family‐controlled firms frame and evaluate the difficult trade‐off between potential gains and losses in financial wealth (FW) and socioemotional wealth (SEW) when pursuing portfolio‐level strategic initiatives, as captured by competitive aggressiveness and complexity. Analyzing 570 public‐listed Korean firms from 1998 to 2017, we find that family‐controlled firms tend to avoid competitive aggressiveness and complexity in their strategic action portfolios. However, our broader perspective leads us to identify critical boundary conditions: this reluctance weakens when firms fall below historical and social performance aspiration levels, as the risks to FW and SEW become more apparent. Conversely, their reluctance strengthens when they retain many family business group affiliations that provide safeguards for FW and SEW.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Variance decomposition approaches are often used to identify key sources of heterogeneity in firm performance. While previous variance decomposition studies have decomposed the drivers of firm performance in product markets (financial performance), we focus on differences in firms' abilities to create the resources that underlie such product market successes. Specifically, we focus on innovation performance. We identify the relative importance of technology area, corporation, business unit, and star inventor effects in determining firms' (1) innovation output, (2) innovation social value, (3) innovation value appropriation, and (4) innovation financial value. We find, across our four measures of innovation performance, the business unit effect is by far the largest (32.6 per cent), followed by the star inventor effect (11.5 per cent), the corporate effect (5.5 per cent), and the technology area effect (1.9 per cent). We discuss the implications of these findings for future innovation studies.</content>

    <title>Artificial states, ethnicity, and the survival of private participation infrastructure projects in Africa</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite increasing interest, research within the context of Africa, particularly in relation to its unique historical dynamics, remains relatively underexplored in international business (IB). ​Our paper explores how colonial-era historical legacies continue to shape the outcomes of present-day private participation infrastructure (PPI) projects in Africa. By analyzing 301 PPI projects across 102 ethnic groups in 32 African countries, we offer insights into how borders misaligned with pre-colonial ethnic boundaries contribute to conflicts that undermine project viability. The findings reveal that ethnic partitioning, defined as the division of ethnic groups across artificial national borders, negatively impacts PPI project survival, with conflict mediating this relationship. While higher institutional quality mitigates these adverse effects, its impact remains marginal. We incorporate historical perspectives and highlight the importance of considering the path dependence of contemporary institutional environments. It also addresses the growing demand for Africa-focused IB research. By incorporating ethnicity into institutional analyses, our study also challenges the traditional IB assumption regarding the primacy of national borders in business activities. Our study points to the importance of understanding historical backgrounds when doing business in Africa.</content>

    <title>Source Memory Is More Accurate for Opinions than for Facts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Effective communication relies on consumers remembering, sharing, and applying relevant information. Source memory, the ability to link a claim to its original source, is an essential aspect of accurate recall, attitude formation, and decision making. We propose that claim objectivity, whether a claim is a fact or an opinion, affects memory for the claim’s source. This proposal follows a two-step process: (i) opinions provide more information about sources than facts do; (ii) claims that provide more information about sources during information encoding are more likely to be accurately attributed to original sources during recall. Across thirteen pre-registered experiments (N = 7,510) and a variety of consumer domains, we investigate the effect of claim objectivity on source memory. We find that source memory is more accurate for opinions than for facts, with no consistent effect on claim recognition memory. We find support for the proposed process by manipulating facts to be more informative about sources and opinions to be less informative about sources. When forming inferences and seeking advice from sources, participants rely more on previously-shared opinions than on previously-shared facts. Our results indicate that opinions are more likely to be accurately attributed to original sources than are facts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores a new channel through which exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can affect underlying asset prices. In over-the-counter markets, daily disclosure of ETF portfolio holdings increases price transparency and thereby retail investors’ bargaining power. I show that ETF-held municipal bonds have significantly lower dealer markups than observationally similar non-ETF-held bonds. This effect cannot be explained by bond selection or ETFs’ own trading activity. Rather, ETFs’ disclosure of end-of-day bond pricing is associated with lower retail markups by 5–9 basis points.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study identification and inference in first-price auctions with risk-averse bidders and selective entry, building on a flexible framework we call the Affiliated Signal with Risk Aversion (AS-RA) model. Assuming exogenous variation in either the number of potential bidders (N) or a continuous instrument (z) shifting opportunity costs of entry, we provide a sharp characterization of the nonparametric restrictions implied by equilibrium bidding. This characterization implies that risk neutrality is nonparametrically testable. In addition, with sufficient variation in both N and z, the AS-RA model primitives are nonparametrically identified (up to a bounded constant) on their equilibrium domains. Finally, we explore new methods for inference in set-identified auction models based on Chen et al. (2018, Econometrica, vol. 86, 1965–2018), as well as novel and fast computational strategies using Mathematical Programming with Equilibrium Constraints. Simulation studies reveal the good finite-sample performance of our inference methods, which can readily be adapted to other set-identified flexible equilibrium models with parameter-dependent support.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A researcher can use a tightly parameterized structural model to obtain internally consistent estimates of a wide range of economically interesting targets. We ask how reliable these estimates are when the researcher’s model may be misspecified. We focus on the case of multivariate, potentially nonlinear models where the causal variable of interest is endogenous. Reliable estimates require that the researcher’s model is flexible enough to describe the effects of the endogenous variable approximately correctly. Reliable estimates do not require that the researcher has correctly specified the role of the exogenous controls in the model. However, if the role of the controls is misspecified, reliable estimates require a property we call strong exclusion. Strong exclusion depends on having sufficiently many instruments that are unrelated to the controls. We discuss how practitioners can achieve strong exclusion, and illustrate our findings with an application to a differentiated goods model of demand for beer.</content>

    <title>Minding the Gap: How Perspective-Taking and Status Reflexivity Help Black Women Executives to Relate Across Difference at Work</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Workplace relationships are a necessary and critical component of being able to perform one’s job and advance in one’s career. The personal and professional resources required for navigating relationships with dissimilar work colleagues can be particularly costly for those in minority groups who are most often different from their relational partners. Drawing from interviews conducted with Black women executives, we examined how these women experience relational triggers that emphasize their differences from others because of their limited numbers at their level. Our findings indicate that Black women executives respond to these relational triggers by engaging in perspective-taking and status reflexivity to understand others’, and their own, perspectives on the identity and status differentials present in the interaction. Through an introspective process, these women assess and address gaps in how they believe their partners see them and how they see themselves, which prompts them to either reduce or maintain perceived gaps depending on the importance of the interaction partner. We also explore how reducing or maintaining the perceived gap ultimately influences how Black women think, feel, or behave toward their relational partner (i.e., relational valence) in ways that may shape how they interpret future interactions. This study advances workplace relationships research by integrating intersectionality literature and by considering how minority perspective-taking and status reflexivity can be useful in navigating relationships across difference.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Statistical Arbitrage with Price ImpactA key challenge to turn price forecasts into profitable trading strategies is to mitigate the adverse impact of large trades. This paper shows that such statistical arbitrage problems can be solved in closed form for general nonparametric price forecasts and for price impact models that account for the nonlinearity in order sizes and gradual decay of impact observed empirically. The implications of these results are illustrated by an empirical case study, in which the price impact models are calibrated to proprietary metaorder data.</content>

    <title>The Joint Determination of Haircuts and Interest Rates for Collateralized Loans in Shadow Banking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the joint determination of haircuts and interest rates for collateralized loans in shadow banking within a general equilibrium model. Three results emerge. First, higher downside quality (the distribution of future collateral payoffs below the debt face value) reduces haircuts only under certain conditions, whereas higher upside quality (the distribution of future collateral payoffs above the debt face value) always increases them. Second, the relative insensitivity of interest rates to shocks, compared with haircuts, occurs when shocks affect only the upside collateral quality and can also arise endogenously, with changes in haircuts amplified and changes in interest rates dampened. Third, when depositors’ saving needs increase, interest rates unexpectedly rise while haircut requirements are relaxed. The same effects occur when banks’ collateral supply shrinks.This paper was accepted by Bruno Biais, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00541 .</content>

    <title>Evolutions of Omni‐Channel Fulfillment Performance: An In‐Depth Case Study in Grocery Retailing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rapid adoption of omni‐channel strategies has prompted grocery retailers to reconfigure their back‐end fulfillment operations to efficiently and effectively meet the demands of online and offline retail channels. Viewing back‐end fulfillment operations in omni‐channel grocery retail as a complex adaptive system, we present an eight‐year multi‐method case study of the UK operations of a leading global grocery retailer. Over this period the share of online sales significantly grew as proportion of overall sales. We observe four evolutions in the back‐end fulfillment complex adaptive system to respond to the operational demands associated with increasing online sales. Complex adaptive systems theory suggests that such evolutions should eventually lead to a state of equilibrium, where the system is reconfigured to effectively and efficiently respond to the market. However, we observe that this equilibrium was never achieved and propose this results from two opposing and irreconcilable environmental energies preventing optimal adaptation. Drawing on both in‐depth interviews and a proprietary fulfillment dataset from the organization, we expose the implications of conflicting energies being imported from the environment, and propose three strategies, drawn from paradox theory, for reconciling these energies within a complex adaptive system.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: How Firms Can Steer Social Media Conversations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many firms struggle with how to craft their messages in conversations with customers on social media. The problem is compounded by the fact that these conversations take place in different, simultaneous threads, each of which potentially requires a different approach depending on the conversation. This paper studies how firms can adapt their responses in individual social media conversations such that the sentiment in different conversations becomes more favorable. We examine a comprehensive set of firm-generated content elements inspired by theory of dialogic listening that emphasizes that a conversation partner should offer 1) empathetic understanding, 2) unconditional positive regard, 3) a spirit of mutual understanding, 4) presentness, and 5) genuineness. We augment this set by also considering taking conversations to a one-on-one channel and whether agents sign with their own name, indicating a personal connection. We furthermore test whether the FGC elements’ effectiveness depends on preceding user sentiment. Based on an analysis of nearly a million tweets capturing over 206k threads involving four major US banks across 10 years, we provide concrete managerial guidance on responding effectively on social media to maximize the positive impact on the sentiment of subsequent user-generated content, and how this guidance depends on preceding user sentiment.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Putting Words in Their Mouths: Firm-Generated User Content and Consumer Sharing Behavior</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;User-generated content, such as word of mouth, traditionally has been immune to firm influences. However, companies have recently started developing content and encouraging consumers to post it rather than relying solely on organic consumer-generated content. Such firm-generated user content (FGUC), which consumers can share easily, potentially alters their sharing behavior by providing specific language to be included in users’ posts. In investigating the effectiveness of FGUC, the current research addresses if and when consumers share this content and whether they alter it. It also identifies which mechanisms drive sharing decisions and the moderating effects of satisfaction. With a series of lab and field studies, the authors demonstrate that providing FGUC increases the likelihood that consumers share a post about their brand experience, by making the sharing process easier. It also tempers the extent to which dissatisfied consumers share posts, by creating incongruence with their experience. This initial, extensive assessment of the emerging FGUC phenomenon offers relevant guidance for marketers regarding when and how to use this novel tool and the potential implications for consumer welfare.</content>

    <title>Rethinking international business scholarship as cross-language knowledge production: a dialogical approach to qualitative research</title>
    <updated>2025-03-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As a disciplinary field, international business (IB) is characterized by language diversity. Too often, however, international business (IB) research regards language diversity as a challenge to be overcome rather than an opportunity to generate new scientific knowledge. Consequently, previous research has primarily focused on the pragmatic, logistical, and methodological hurdles of translating multilingual datasets. In contrast, this conceptual paper takes language diversity as an opportunity to produce new knowledge and proposes a dialogical approach to qualitative cross-language research. The dialogical approach has the potential to enrich IB research with novel perspectives from under-represented voices, improve the understanding of IB phenomena and nurture tolerance for diversity and inclusion through cross-language interaction. It is worth noting that the dialogical approach does not promote shared understanding but mutual understanding that is achieved through collaboration. In doing so, it builds on two types of dialogue: (self-)reflexive dialogue, and dialogue between the researcher and others (interviewees, supervisors, and collaborators participating in the research process). The outcome is knowledge that is pluralistic and multivocal, including the voices that belong to non-English-speaking participants and scholars. We argue that the dialogical approach contributes to the future vision of responsible and linguistically inclusive IB scholarship.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate whether managers’ intrinsic incentives affect firms’ environmental policies. Exploiting within-facility variation in facility-to-CEO-birthplace distances, we find that facilities located near CEOs’ birthplaces experience toxic emission reductions relative to those farther away. This is achieved by reducing waste generation at source rather than by downsizing operations or substituting pollution across locations. The effect is strongest for hometown facilities in high-polluting areas, and in firms with higher cash holdings and with CEOs with weaker pay incentives. Our results suggest that local representation in management could be a powerful means of encouraging corporate pollution abatement.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Open strategy (OS) requires contributors with a variety of functional backgrounds to episodically perform a strategy role in addition to their functional responsibilities. These actors engage in micro‐role transitions as they temporarily shift from one role to another. In this study, we identify the discursive tactics through which such micro‐role transitions are enacted by drawing on data from an online OS community. We show that in OS, micro‐role transitions occur in an ambiguous role environment where actors actively construct role entry using downplaying tactics and justifying tactics, and imbue ill‐defined strategy roles with meaning by applying idealizing tactics. These moralized discourses enable actors to distance themselves not only from their functional roles but also from the role of professional strategists. We show that the interplay of role distance and responses of different relevant actors shapes actors' strategy role formation in OS. We synthesize these arguments into a conceptual model and provide new insights into the role dynamics involved in OS and beyond, as well as the role‐level factors underpinning the efficacy of OS.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the relationship between major customer concentration and supplier firms’ adoption of blockchain. Using a sample of 9,745 Chinese firm-year observations spanning 2018–2021, we find that the likelihood of suppliers’ blockchain technology adoption in supply chain management is negatively associated with major customer concentration. The negative relation is reduced when supplier firms possess greater bargaining power and demonstrate governance mechanisms against information leakage, and when major customers have less incentive to engage in opportunistic behaviors, and have fewer concerns regarding information leakage by suppliers. Our findings suggest that major customers tend to discourage supplier firms from adopting blockchain due to the concerns regarding competitive advantages and information leakage risk.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze howNfirms producing a commodity good with a polluting by-product respond to environmental taxes. These firms vary in operational and environmental efficiency. Under Cournot competition, we examine two demand functions: iso-elastic and linear. We establish the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium and how it changes with tax levels and environmental efficiency. Our findings suggest that taxes may not always benefit firms with green, low-cost technologies, as they erode the advantages of operational efficiency. Additionally, total and per-unit emissions may increase with higher taxes or improved environmental efficiency. Finally, the observed effects can qualitatively differ based on the form of market demand.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate an ambulatory care scheduling problem derived from a real case in Ontario, Canada that offers multi-appointment, multi-class, multi-priority treatments in geographically distributed campuses with multiple resources. We consider a dynamic setting with uncertain patient arrival and use of the emergency department. This problem is formulated as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process model. Since we cannot solve large-sized instances via conventional approaches, we hybridize this model with a neural network to simplify feasibility constraints while respecting all assumptions. Given the curse of dimensionality, we use an affine approximation architecture to estimate the value function. An equivalent linear programming model is solved through column generation in order to compute approximate optimal policies and derive two easy-to-implement scheduling policies. Simulation results demonstrate that the approximate optimal policy and heuristics outperform alternative scheduling policies. Finally, we demonstrate that the application of our methodology can enhance performance metrics in a large ambulatory care center in Canada. We show that a template-based scheduling rule can result in high resource utilization but poor scheduling decisions. However, an efficient scheduling policy equips a booking clerk with intelligent scheduling rules that are difficult for her to predict in real-time and work well in comparison to scheduling templates.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Mitigating Churn after Online Financial Fraud: the Value of Blame Attribution</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The financial industry is plagued with account-based fraudulent transactions in which perpetrators surreptitiously siphon away money from customer accounts. To address this recurrent problem, service operations teams at financial institutions (e.g., the fraud detection and mitigation teams) spend millions yearly identifying perpetrators, attributing blame, and averting customer churn. However, in the vast majority of cases, the service operations teams cannot trace fraudulent transactions back to the perpetrators, and hence it remains unclear whether they should continue to expend significant resources into investigating account-based fraud and attributing blame. Employing a wide range of econometric and machine learning techniques on a rich dataset from a U.S. bank, and an experiment, we attempt to offer the first empirical assessment of the association between blame attribution, or lack of it, in response to customer-identified account-based fraud and customer churn. The results indicate that relative to the customers that did not experience fraud, those that did and received a resolutionlackingblame attribution have 40.69%Lift(95% CI = [24.41%Lift, 56.97%Lift]) in churn rate. However, customers that experienced fraud and received a resolution involving blame attribution have -62.45%Lift(95% CI = [-31.22%Lift, -93.68%Lift]) in churn rate, making them less likely to churn than those that did not experience fraud. The latter result offers one of the first field evidence of the well-known service recovery paradox. Additionally, we observe significant heterogeneity in the findings based on customer tenure and the number of customer-firm interactions and document the long-term effects of attributing and not attributing blame. These insights can assist service operations teams in their post-service failure efforts to mend customer-firm relationships. Overall, the results underscore the importance of blame attribution during service recovery for service operations teams and inform a topical debate on a banking reform proposed by the U.S. Department of Treasury.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Pricing in the Presence of Strategic Consumers and Social Learning under Contingent Pricing and Price Guarantee</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Purchasing new experience products or services often involves significant quality uncertainty for both consumers and firms. Social learning through online reviews helps reduce this uncertainty but exacerbates strategic waiting, as consumers delay purchases to gain more information. This paper examines the impact of social learning on firms’ pricing policies in the presence of strategic consumers under two widely adopted schemes: contingent pricing and price guarantee. We find that while social learning always benefits the firm, it enables the price guarantee scheme to outperform contingent pricing in terms of profitability for highly patient consumers, which would not be possible without social learning. Notably, social learning drives a range of pricing patterns, even making price skimming optimal under price guarantee for highly patient consumers, as high initial prices combined with markdowns effectively alleviate strategic waiting, enhancing review outcomes and the firm’s profitability. Additionally, social learning always enables the firm to extract greater consumer surplus for impatient consumers under price guarantee. In contrast, social learning under contingent pricing consistently benefits consumers and can achieve win-win outcomes when consumers are moderately patient. Our extensions validate the robustness of these findings under different assumptions, including fully rational consumers and partially forward-looking firms. In particular, a partially forward-looking firm can achieve win-win outcomes with social learning under price guarantee, expanding its practical applicability. This study provides novel insights into the role of social learning in shaping pricing strategies, highlighting its implications for firm profitability and consumer welfare in markets influenced by review dynamics and strategic consumers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we explore the impact of implementing an algorithmic supervisor, a data analytics tool that offers real-time feedback to employees, on their overall performance. We collaborate with a leading service company that initiated the transition from human supervisors to an algorithmic supervisor for managing call agents in their outbound call center on September 18, 2019. We collect data for 220,085 calls over a span of 6 months—that is, 3 months before and 3 months after the introduction of the algorithmic supervisor. We find that the introduction of the algorithmic supervisor improved the agents’ service quality in terms of customer satisfaction; however, this came at the expense of quantity as fewer customers were served. In particular, the adoption of the algorithmic supervisor resulted in a 15.80% reduction in the number of served customers, accompanied by a 14.91% increase in the number of satisfied customers. Moreover, our study uncovers a gender-related dimension to the impact of the algorithmic supervisor. Before its adoption, male agents outperformed their female counterparts. However, after its adoption, female agents exhibited an 11.52% increase in the number of served customers, and a remarkable 14.00% increase in the number of satisfied customers as compared to their male counterparts. Our results suggest that the adoption of the algorithmic supervisor strikes a new economic balance between service quality and service quantity and generates a social impact in differently affecting service performance of female and male employees.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Enhancing User Experience: Unveiling the Role of the Quality Score Metrics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social advertising platforms and search engines employ the so-called quality score to favor certain advertisers in ad auctions. These scores typically consider a number of factors including ad relevance, clickthrough rate, and landing page quality. While quality scores are often justified as a mechanism to enhance ad rank and reduce cost per click for high-quality ads, this study examines their broader role in incentivizing advertisers with varying investment costs to improve landing page quality and explores the implications for advertisers’ profits and the platform’s revenue in a setting where landing page quality is an endogenous decision made by advertisers.The results suggest that a quality score function rewarding landing page quality in excess of the clickthrough rate incentivizes advertisers to invest in page quality in a non-monotonic way. These incentives have dual effects on auction dynamics: while advertisers can lower their cost per click by improving quality, such incentives also increase advertisers’ competitive pressure to maintain their quality advantage and secure the discount per click, particularly for those in higher positions. Our findings reveal that the former effect dominates, leading to increased advertiser profits with higher rewards. However, the intensified competition slows the profit growth for the top-position advertiser when the bottom-position advertiser invests. For platform revenue, which comprises both auction revenue and benefits derived from user experience, a quality score in excess of CTR is recommended when the user experience benefits are substantial enough to compensate for auction revenue losses. In a scenario where page quality is capped, our results show that a quality score in excess of CTR can generate higher platform revenue, even in the absence of user experience benefits. Several managerial implications for both advertisers and the platform are discussed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Axiomatic Insights into Ambiguity Aversion: Binary Diversification and Exact CapacitiesIn decision sciences, ambiguity refers to uncertainty about event probabilities, and aversion to it is a well-studied phenomenon. In “Binary Diversification Characterizes Exact Capacities,” Hartmann and Kauffeldt consider the Choquet expected utility model, a framework for modeling ambiguity. They provide the first axiomatic characterization of exact capacities, solving an old problem. Their characterizing axiom, binary diversification, captures a specific level of ambiguity aversion—a preference for diversifications that lead to (at most) binary outcomes. They also propose an intuitive hierarchy of ambiguity aversion and illustrate that this hierarchy reflects increasingly strong levels of ambiguity aversion within the more general invariant biseparable model, whereas the hierarchy has limited bite in the Choquet model. They conclude by illustrating the implications for multiobjective shortest-path problems, demonstrating how the results can be applied.</content>

    <title>A Sample Size Calculation for Training and Certifying Targeting Policies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose an approach for determining the sample size required when using an experiment to train and certify a targeting policy. Calculating the rate at which the performance of a targeting model improves with additional training data is a complex problem. We address this challenge by assuming that customers are grouped into segments that capture relevant information about their responsiveness to the firm’s marketing actions. We consider two problem formulations. The first formulation identifies the sample size required to train a targeting policy and certify that its expected performance exceeds a predefined threshold. The second formulation identifies the sample size required to train a targeting policy and certify that it outperforms a baseline in an out-of-sample statistical test. We establish theoretical properties of these problems, based on which we propose computationally efficient algorithms for optimal sample size calculations. We illustrate our algorithms and analysis using data from a luxury fashion retailer.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02947 .</content>

    <title>The Informativeness of Balance Sheet Disaggregations: Evidence from Forecasting Operating Assets</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the usefulness of balance sheet disaggregations in the context of forecasting operating asset growth and its implications for revenue growth. We show that models using disaggregated balance sheet information have greater accuracy than models that use only aggregate information, with the most accurate disaggregation scheme separately considering property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, other noncurrent operating assets, and current operating assets. When investigating market participants’ use of disaggregated balance sheet information, we find that differences in growth predictions from a disaggregated model and an aggregate model are associated with year-ahead abnormal returns, suggesting that investors do not fully utilize disaggregated balance sheet information. We corroborate this result by showing that returns are concentrated around the earnings announcement, are more pronounced for stocks with low transient institutional ownership, and are consistent with subsequent improvements in actual financial performance. Finally, we find that these returns are driven by both the asset growth predictions of a disaggregated model and the ability of such a model to incorporate the unique revenue-generating ability of individual asset components. Importantly, we find that our results are incremental to the information embedded in income statement disaggregations, even when forecasting income statement items such as profitability. Overall, our study provides evidence on the informativeness of balance sheet disaggregations and proposes the use of disaggregated models when forecasting growth in operating assets and its implications for future revenues.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org10.1287/mnsc.2023.01413 .</content>

    <title>Human-Algorithm Collaboration with Private Information: Naïve Advice-Weighting Behavior and Mitigation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Even if algorithms make better predictions than humans on average, humans may sometimes have private information that an algorithm does not have access to that can improve performance. How can we help humans effectively use and adjust recommendations made by algorithms in such situations? When deciding whether and how to override an algorithm’s recommendations, we hypothesize that people are biased toward following naïve advice-weighting (NAW) behavior; they take a weighted average between their own prediction and the algorithm’s prediction, with a constant weight across prediction instances regardless of whether they have valuable private information. This leads to humans overadhering to the algorithm’s predictions when their private information is valuable and underadhering when it is not. In an online experiment where participants were tasked with making demand predictions for 20 products while having access to an algorithm’s predictions, we confirm this bias toward NAW and find that it leads to a 20%–61% increase in prediction error. In a second experiment, we find that feature transparency—even when the underlying algorithm is a black box—helps users more effectively discriminate how to deviate from algorithms, resulting in a 25% reduction in prediction error. We make further improvements in a third experiment via an intervention designed to move users away from advice weighting and instead, use only their private information to inform deviations, leading to a 34% reduction in prediction error.This paper has been This paper was accepted by Elena Katok for the Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03850 .</content>

    <title>Pay transparency and productivity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article investigates the productivity consequences of pay transparency. Tracking the research output of 20,000 US academics and leveraging staggered shocks to transparency, we show that productivity responses vary predictably based on what pay transparency reveals. We reject a hypothesis that pay transparency leads to a decline in productivity. Rather, we find that those who transparency reveals to be inequitably overcompensated subsequently increase their effort, while those inequitably undercompensated subsequently weakly decrease their effort. Controlling for such pay inequity, the simple level of pay has little effect on productivity. Our study provides one of the first field‐based empirical investigations of the productivity consequences of wage transparency and points to the importance of clearly delineating the effects driven by equity as opposed to equality of rewards allocations.Managerial SummaryWhile evidence suggests that pay transparency consistently reduces discrimination, many organizations have resisted implementation over concerns about its impact on productivity. To date, there has been very little evidence to either confirm or reject this concern. This study of 20,000 US academics directly addresses the effect of pay transparency on productivity. We find that when salaries become public, average productivity does not decline. However, there is a varied individual productivity response that depends on what transparency reveals to individual employees about their pay and its fairness relative to peers. Employees who found they were paid more than their performance warranted increased their productivity, likely to justify their elevated compensation. Conversely, unfairly underpaid individuals decreased their productivity, particularly when they had job security. Notably, individuals seem to care more about pay fairness than pay equality. Our results also highlight another benefit of pay transparency: employees who became aware of the potential for substantial salary raises through promotion enhanced their productivity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;According to existing theories, short-term creditors promote corporate governance by responding quickly to new information. I show that this very feature of short-term debt can also undermine corporate governance. Though moderate levels of short-term debt improve the efficacy of blockholder exit and increase blockholders’ incentives to engage with the firm, high levels of short-term debt impair governance. In particular, high levels of short-term debt render the threat of exit noncredible, make public engagements too risky, and undermine blockholders’ incentives to engage behind the scenes. I identify a challenge in the governance of firms that rely on short-term funding such as banks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A key question in labor market research is how the unemployment insurance system affects unemployment rates and labor market dynamics. We provide new answers to this old question by studying one of the largest unemployment insurance reforms in recent decades, the German Hartz reforms. On average, lower separation rates into unemployment account for 76% of declining unemployment after the reform, a fact unexplained by existing research focusing on job-finding rates. Exploiting institutional changes by age, employment duration, and wages, we establish a causal link between the reform and changes in labor market dynamics. Relying on labor market theory, we generalize our empirical findings beyond the German case and establish separation rate changes as an important macroeconomic adjustment channel after UI reforms. We derive analytically that the change of separation rates increases in proportion to average unemployment duration suggesting an equally important role for most other European labor markets.</content>

    <title>Long Jump Learning: Absorbing Distant Knowledge via Familiar Components</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do firms overcome the challenge of absorbing distant knowledge? Scholars argue that organizations need knowledge that is distant from their existing knowledge base to create novel innovative output, whereas others argue, in contrast, that organizations need knowledge to be similar to the firm’s knowledge base in order to absorb it. We argue that organizations can improve their ability to identify and comprehend knowledge from a distant knowledge category through learning associations made by a category link—a familiar tangible component previously used by somebody else in the distant knowledge category. We test our arguments using a sample of patents in which the material graphene is used as a component across diverse patent classes (i.e., knowledge categories). We find that increasing experience with category-linking graphene enables an organization to patent in increasingly distant graphene-linked patent classes and also increases the number of patents in such classes. We also find that the extent to which category-linking graphene is prominent in a distant knowledge category enhances the effect of graphene experience on a firm’s ability to absorb knowledge from the distant knowledge category. We, thus, present a novel internal mechanism by which an organization can absorb distant knowledge.</content>

    <title>The Misfit Bias</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers and other audiences often penalize products that combine unrelated elements. In this paper, we document the consequences of that penalty for the evaluation of the elements being combined. Building on the idea that audiences cannot fully disentangle the quality of “fit” between elements from the quality of the elements individually, we argue that audiences are likely to direct their dislike of a misfit product to the individual elements being combined. Using an archival study of the music industry and an online experiment with photographic galleries, we find that evaluations of individual elements (songs, photographs) are influenced by product-level fit (albums, galleries). Elements of misfit products are evaluated less favorably than they would have been otherwise. Moreover, this bias is exacerbated when the evaluation of the whole product is emphasized. We discuss the implications of this “misfit bias” for the innovation, entrepreneurship, and categories literatures.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17462 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The effects of private equity buyouts on employment, productivity, and job reallocation vary tremendously with macroeconomic and credit conditions, across private equity groups, and by type of buyout. We reach this conclusion by examining the most extensive database of U.S. buyouts ever compiled, encompassing thousands of buyout targets from 1980 to 2013 and millions of control firms. Employment shrinks 12% over two years after buyouts of publicly listed firms—on average, and relative to control firms—but expands 15% after buyouts of privately held firms. Postbuyout productivity gains at target firms are large on average and much larger yet for deals executed amid tight credit conditions. A postbuyout tightening of credit conditions or slowing of gross domestic product growth curtails employment growth and intrafirm job reallocation at target firms. We also show that buyout effects differ across the private equity groups that sponsor buyouts, and these differences persist over time at the group level. Rapid upscaling in deal flow at the group level brings lower employment growth at target firms. We relate these findings to theories of private equity that highlight agency problems at portfolio firms and within the private equity industry itself.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Harvard Business School’s Division of Research, the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, the Smith Richardson Foundation [Grant no. 2014-0136], and the Private Capital Research Institute.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03890 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use panel data on expected and realized changes in household finances to study the process of expectation formation. Households extrapolate from improvements in financial situation, but deteriorations are associated with an increased dispersion of forecasts, and higher probabilities of both negative and positive forecast errors. Individuals who expect earnings declines to revert too quickly save less and are more likely to be financially worse off again in the future. Learning from past errors reduces the likelihood that individuals are optimistic following a deterioration in their finances. The evidence shows how experiences, learning, and life events matter for expectation formation.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03257 .</content>

    <title>Central Bank Liquidity Backstops, Bank Regulation, and Risk-Taking by Asset Managers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Central bank liquidity backstops and bank leverage regulation interact across financial intermediaries and states of the world. A backstop is implemented only in some states to grease the wheels of bank dealers that absorb fire sales. It also incentivizes asset managers to take on excessive redemption risk. Regulation binds in other states, in which it hamstrings market making. Because this outcome increases asset managers’ fire sale costs, it reins in their risk-taking. Empirically, we confirm such a disciplining effect of regulation on U.S. money market funds. Theoretically, we derive that the two policy measures complement each other in raising social welfare because they address different sources of redemption-driven losses—fire sale costs for given risk-taking and excessive risk-taking, respectively.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06997 .</content>

    <title>Success and Failure of Blockchain Technology Providers: Founders' Power, Beyond‐Blockchain Exploration and Centralized Decision‐Making</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite a growing focus on blockchain adoption within operations and supply chains, these initiatives exhibit an exceedingly high failure rate, with many failing to achieve sustainable success. Why are enterprise blockchain adoptions highly susceptible to failure? In our inductive case study of five technology providers offering blockchain services for operations and supply chains, we examine how founders' power (i.e., expert, prestige, and ownership) shapes management behaviors that build blockchain perceptions and influence stakeholders toward strategic adoption. Our findings reveal that high‐performing cases actively seek inspiration beyond the blockchain ecosystem for service designs and adopt a centralized decision‐making approach where key strategic decisions are made internally. In contrast, low‐performing cases struggle due to within‐blockchain exploration and decentralized decision‐making, leading to slower implementation and limited scalability. Furthermore, we find that founders' behaviors in blockchain adoption are embraced by firm members through performance evaluation and interactions, shaping organizational practices and culture, ultimately determining the success or failure of blockchain technology providers. This study extends previous research at the intersection of founders' power and blockchain literature by developing propositions about how different sources of founders' power lead to distinct management behaviors, influencing the success or failure of blockchain adoption outcomes.</content>

    <title>Beyond Rugged Individualism?: Exploring the Resilience of Black Entrepreneurs to Chronic Racism</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how the resilience process unfolds for Black entrepreneurs in the context of chronic racism, employing a novel qualitative approach that combines Group Model Building (GMB) and semi‐structured interviews with 49 Black entrepreneurs. Drawing on the socio‐ecological theory of resilience and leveraging Critical Race Theory (CRT), the research finds that resilience, shaped by the persistent nature of racism, requires ongoing adaptation rather than a return to a pre‐adversity state. This continuous adaptation can lead to the depletion of coping resources. The study also illustrates how internal and external coping mechanisms interact, showing that over‐reliance on internal coping mechanisms arises due to insufficient institutional and social support. Our research contributes to the literature on Black entrepreneurship, resilience, and race in entrepreneurship, while offering a comprehensive policy approach to both support and empower Black entrepreneurs. We advocate for decolonizing research practices that not only study but actively benefit the communities involved, fostering engaged and transformative scholarship.</content>

    <title>Social Media and Political Affiliation: How Expressing Hot-Button Opinions Affects Raters’ Assessments of Job Applicants</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractPeople frequently post their views on hot-button issues, such as immigration, on social media platforms on which the content is often publicly accessible to broad audiences. One of these audiences is hiring managers as more than 50% of organizations report viewing job applicants’ accounts as part of social media screening during the hiring process. Our research shows that applicants’ social media activity on hot-button issues can significantly impact their hireability. In a study of 377 professionals with hiring experience, we find that viewing applicants’ social media posts about immigration influenced judgments of similarity, likability, and two dimensions of hireability: expected task performance and expected organizational citizenship behaviors. Surprisingly, the hot-button posts outweighed job-relevant information regardless of where (Facebook or Twitter) the content was viewed; this indicates hiring managers generalized their impressions across social media platforms. A post hoc qualitative applicability check with 79 hiring managers confirmed these findings. Our study highlights the risks of using hedonic social media for screening job applicants, emphasizing the need for organizations to be mindful of how personal disclosures online can unintentionally influence hiring decisions.</content>

    <title>Algorithms to the Rescue: Market Mechanisms for Consensual Trading of Unbiased Individual Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a novel algorithmic market mechanism to address key challenges in individual data markets. Current data collection practices lack transparency and proper compensation, leading privacy-conscious users to opt out and creating biased data sets. Our proposed mechanism enables an intermediary platform to obtain unbiased samples of individual-level data while appropriately compensating users for privacy loss. Through theoretical analysis and simulations using both synthetic and real-world data sets, the authors demonstrate that their mechanism provides unbiased data samples at near-optimal cost compared with benchmark approaches. The mechanism outperforms both fixed-compensation methods and centralized-optimization approaches, even when platforms have partial information about user privacy preferences. Surprisingly, platforms achieve better outcomes by using this market mechanism rather than relying on estimated privacy preferences from user behavior. The approach is practical to implement, using straightforward sampling and conventional compensation mechanisms rather than complex techniques, like differential privacy. The mechanism enables creation of effective data markets that benefit both data subjects and buyers while ensuring compliance with regulations requiring transparency and consent. The findings are particularly relevant as new privacy regulations emerge globally and third-party tracking faces increased constraints, providing a viable solution for improving data quality and fairness in digital markets.</content>

    <title>Artificial Intelligence and Firm Resilience: Empirical Evidence from Natural Disaster Shocks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly deployed in business operations over the past decade, whereas direct evidence of its effectiveness in uncertain contexts is limited. Our work examines the contribution of AI to corporate resilience under natural disaster shocks, particularly concentrating on AI-using and goods-producing firms. We measure firm AI investment by the cumulative AI-relevant skills extracted from a comprehensive job posting database and firm resilience by the changes in corporate valuation in response to operational shocks. Evidence suggests that AI generates resilience: An average firm that equips 2.4% of total jobs to be AI-related could approximately recover the full damage of disasters reflected in corporate valuation over a short event window. From the product function test, we find that resilience is attributable to the moderating effect of AI on the damaged input responsiveness under the volatile production environment. Our analyses further reveal a pressing phenomenon: Although underperforming firms could benefit more from an additional unit of AI investment, the realized productivity is notably restrained due to a lack of complementary organizational designs. Our findings provide managerial implications regarding the interplay between environmental conditions and firm investments in both AI technology and complementary infrastructures.</content>

    <title>Extrapolative Income Expectations and Retirement Savings</title>
    <updated>2025-03-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how biased income expectations affect annual contributions to retirement accounts, highlighting variations across income levels. Empirical findings show that low-income workers are generally pessimistic about future earnings, whereas high-income workers tend to be overly optimistic. I develop a lifecycle model that merges these expectation biases with U.S. 401(k) plan features. The model reveals that biased expectations can account for observed delays in retirement contributions, which increase gradually with tenure. Contributions rise at different rates, with low-income workers starting later than high-income workers. Policy simulations indicate that automatic enrollment boosts initial contributions but results in a relative decline compared to active enrollment. Nonetheless, cumulative savings increase by 4.8 percent on average, with gains surpassing 10 percent for the lowest income quartile. These results highlight the significance of addressing income expectations in retirement policies and show that automatic enrollment can enhance welfare, particularly for lower-income individuals.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Injecting Little Variations to Create Large Gains: Rethinking Online Retail PricingIn today’s fast-changing markets, businesses rely on precise, timely causal insights to guide effective operational decisions. In a new study, “Instrumenting While Experimenting: An Empirical Method for Competitive Pricing at Scale,” the authors introduce an idea of “instrumenting while experimenting.” By introducing small, random variations into routine decision-making processes, they generate causal insights on the impact of business decisions across different competitive dynamics, enabling large-scale operational improvements without disrupting daily business operations.Partnering with a major U.S. e-commerce retailer, the researchers apply this approach to develop a competitive pricing method that enhances response accuracy to competitors’ price changes at scale. Implemented on over 10,000 products, the method delivers significant gains—boosting revenue by more than 15% and profit by over 10%. These gains stem from the successful implementation of the instrumenting while experimenting idea as well as the joint use of experimentation, causal inference, and optimization tools. Moreover, this framework and its implementation provide deeper substantive insights into competitive response strategies and offer a promising blueprint for businesses navigating dynamic online markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Tactics to Counter Missile and Drone ThreatsIn “Hard and Soft Defense Against a Sequence of Aerial Threats,” Atkinson and Kress develop an analytical model for missile defense in which a Blue defender counters sequential attacks by Red threats using both hard defense (HD) interceptors and soft measures (SM), such as jamming and decoys. Their model focuses on a shoot-look-shoot tactic by which Blue fires salvos of interceptors and then assesses the battle damage to decide on further engagement. Their objective is to minimize two performance metrics: the number of threats that manage to penetrate the defenses (leakers) and the number of costly interceptors expended. By establishing efficient frontiers in a two-dimensional performance space, they identify effective firing sequences for various scenarios. Their primary contribution is the development of a framework that integrates HD with SM, allowing for an examination of how SM affects interceptor allocation and missile defense tactics.</content>

First, future making scholarship overlooks existing academic research, in which similar concerns have been pursued, empirically and conceptually, for years. Second, utopian futures are considered achievable if only actors have a vision of what they wish to create. Finally, most future making statements around grand challenges rely on little more than hope, failing to account for the complex relationalities shaping them. I substantiate my argument by drawing on the scenario planning literature, Knightian uncertainty, and anthropology of future research. I also critique thePoint'scall for future making scholars to adopt practice‐based approaches (Wenzel et al., forthcoming) in their empirical inquiries, arguing that the ‘as Practice’ move in management studies is yet to achieve its aspirations. Additionally, I caution against the otherCounterpointin this debate that future making requires the realization of desired and emancipatory futures (Comi et al., forthcoming), as this view is too restrictive for broad and deep future making theorizing to emerge.</content>

    <title>Unveiling Propriety, Validity and Consensus: A Multi‐level Examination of Legitimacy Following the Global Financial Crisis</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Previous work on legitimacy has conceptualized its multi‐level nature, encompassing individual‐level propriety and collective‐level validity. Recently, scholars have introduced the construct of consensus, the degree to which evaluators agree in terms of their propriety beliefs. While validity and consensus can overlap, they can also manifest distinctly, with validity masking underlying disagreement (i.e., low consensus). Furthermore, some work has begun to theorize the effects of this validity‐consensus incongruity from a multi‐level perspective, but it has yet to systematically integrate micro‐oriented theory to explain how evaluators assess legitimacy. We address this limitation by examining the individual‐level consequences of the validity‐consensus incongruity following a negative shock. Specifically, using a multi‐level regression discontinuity design and data from 6260 evaluators across 17 countries, we examine changes in evaluators' propriety beliefs about the legitimacy of free markets following the 2008 global financial crisis. In contrast to prior research, we theorize that high validity amplifies a shock's negative impact on evaluators' propriety beliefs. In addition, we establish how consensus explains variation in evaluators' responses to a shock, particularly in high‐validity, low‐consensus contexts. By bringing together two important strands of the legitimacy literature, we extend prior theory and pioneer an empirical test of the nuanced nature of legitimacy.</content>

    <title>Disentangling Knowledge Diversity: The Interactive Effect of Heterogeneity‐Based Knowledge Diversity and Inequality‐Based Knowledge Diversity on Team Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Whereas knowledge heterogeneity has been extensively studied in relation to innovation, the inequality dimension of knowledge diversity has been largely unexplored. We propose that these two dimensions should be considered in conjunction, given thatheterogeneity‐based knowledge diversity– member differences in knowledge domain – can invite the elaboration of diverse information and perspectives that can foster team innovativeness, butinequality‐based knowledge diversity– member differences in recognized knowledge level – can disrupt the positive effect of heterogeneity‐based knowledge diversity by stifling the recognition and integration of these diverse perspectives. Our longitudinal analysis of drug patents supported our prediction that inequality‐based knowledge diversity weakened the positive effect of heterogeneity‐based knowledge diversity on knowledge team innovativeness. These findings suggest a fundamental reset in the study of team knowledge diversity: theory and research need to conceptualize team member knowledge differences as based on both heterogeneity and status inequality, and investigate their joint impact on team performance.</content>

    <title>Measuring Greenhouse Gas Emissions: What Are the Costs and Benefits?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We adopt a financial‐materiality approach in studying the costs and benefits of measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on social welfare. Production by firms internally generates direct GHG emissions (Scope 1 emissions) whereas outsourcing to suppliers generates indirect emissions (Scope 3 emissions). Our analysis incorporates two frictions: (1) long‐term negative environmental externalities caused by emissions and (2) fragmentation in regulating emissions disclosures across jurisdictions. We show firms' failure to internalize the environmental externalities provides a rationale for mandating Scopes 1 and 3 emissions disclosures. However, such disclosures induce emissions leakage. Disciplining emissions leakage calls for setting complementary—rather than independent—disclosure requirements for Scopes 1 and 3 emissions. Our analysis underscores the importance of improving the reliability of Scope 3 emissions measurements given that measurements of Scope 1 emissions are highly reliable for public firms in Europe and the United States. Regulators can further enhance the disciplinary effects of Scope 3 emission measurements by requiring the allocations of Scope 3 emissions in supply chains to individual firms, especially when allocating Scope 3 emissions is more reliable, and for firms/industries that are more prone to transition climate risk relative to physical climate risk.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Randomized Apportionment: A Fairer Distribution of SeatsThe question of how to apportion the seats of the U.S. House of Representatives to states has fueled century-long political debates and sparked mathematical theory. Traditional deterministic methods, such as the Hamilton method or the currently used Huntington–Hill method, may result in paradoxes or substantially deviate from proportionality. In their paper “In This Apportionment Lottery, the House Always Wins,” Gölz, Peters, and Procaccia propose a randomized approach that ensures each state receives its exact proportional share of seats in expectation and its proportional share, up to rounding, ex post. By incorporating randomization, the authors argue, the system can better adhere to the principle of proportional representation, minimizing the impact of small counting errors and ensuring fairness over time. In addition, their approach achieves house monotonicity, a property that prevents counterintuitive outcomes when the total number of seats changes. This is achieved through a novel cumulative rounding technique, a generalization of dependent rounding on bipartite graphs with potential applications beyond apportionment, including EU commission nominations and resource allocation.</content>

    <title>Price-Fixing Cartels and Firm Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the relationship between price-fixing cartels and firm innovation using a data set encompassing all 461 cartel cases and 1,818 firms identified in the United States in the years 1975–2016. A difference-in-differences estimation reveals a positive relationship between collusion and innovation. Colluding firms exhibited increases of 28% in patent filings, 20% in top-quality patents, and 16% in research and development investment. Innovation breadth also expanded by 16%, suggesting that firms explored new technological areas. Once cartels were dissolved, innovation activities reverted to precollusion levels. The effect varied across industries and was more pronounced in fast-growing and patent-intensive industries, underscoring the importance of technological opportunities. Further, the umbrella pricing effect that also benefits noncolluding competitors offers a unique opportunity to unpack mechanisms. Results reveal that the extra financial resources account for at least a quarter of the effect with stronger cartels exhibiting more pronounced effects. Specifically, firms that relied more on internal financing before collusion and that generated higher revenues during collusion showed a greater effect; no evidence was found of capital reallocation within firms. As much as the remaining three quarters of the effect can be attributed to managerial expectations of future profitability. These findings offer insights for managers and policymakers aiming to foster novel innovation although careful interpretation is required given the heterogeneous effects.This paper was accepted by Ashish Arora, entrepreneurship and innovation.Funding: This work was supported by the Institute of Management Research, Seoul National University; Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.01838 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cryptocurrencies have prompted a shift away from classic security attacks toward ransomware-based extortion. To better understand the impact of cryptocurrencies on the cybersecurity landscape, we conduct a comparative analysis of cybersecurity metrics prior to and after the adoption of cryptocurrency using a series of connected software-use models in the presence of security externalities. In this framework, we endogenize the actions of both heterogeneous consumers and attackers, with entry of the latter being driven by both the size of the unpatched consumer population and, as a subset of it, the size of the ransom-paying consumer population. We first examine users’ adoption and patching behavior under both security scenarios. We explore how changes in attacker entry costs impact outcomes under both conventional and post-crypto ransomware threat landscapes. We show that ransomware scenarios may be more desirable than conventional ones when attacker entry costs are low, provided that the gains from entering with standard attacks under the ransomware scenario are not too high. However, under such scenarios, social welfare can increase under the same conditions that lead to larger ransoms being demanded and a higher expected total ransom being paid, which presents a conundrum to policymakers. We also examine the impact of market parameters associated with security losses from conventional attacks and residual losses when victims pay in ransomware attacks.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: This work was partially supported by Insung Research Grant of KUBS, the LG Yonam Foundation (of Korea), and an award from the Georgia Institute of Technology Center of International Business Education and Research as part of its funded research program.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00969 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Industrial policies are widely used across the world. In practice, designing and implementing these policies is a complicated task. In this paper, we assess the long-term performance of different industrial policy instruments, which include production subsidies, investment subsidies, entry subsidies, and consolidation policies. To do so, we examine a recent industrial policy in China aiming to propel the country’s shipbuilding industry to the largest globally. Using firm-level data from 1998 to 2014 and a dynamic model of firm entry, exit, investment, and production, we find that (i) the policy boosted China’s domestic investment, entry, and international market share dramatically, but delivered low returns and led to fragmentation, idle capacity, as well as depressed world ship prices; (ii) the effectiveness of different policy instruments is mixed: production and investment subsidies can be justified by market share considerations, while entry subsidies are wasteful; (iii) counter-cyclical policies, firm-targeting, and shortening the intervention horizon can substantially reduce distortions. Our results highlight the critical role of firm heterogeneity, business cycles, and firms’ cost structure in policy design. Finally, when exploring potential rationales, we find support for nonclassical considerations, such as reducing freight rates to boost Chinese trade.</content>

    <title>Reactions, Revisions, and Rehiring: Changes in Employers’ Gendered Preferences in Online Labor Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employers in online labor marketplaces prefer women over men because of stereotypes that women are more trustworthy. These stereotypes are especially salient in this context because of the uncertainty in online transactions. Yet, employers’ interactions with women and men workers might moderate the influence of trustworthiness stereotypes and, by extension, employers’ hiring preferences for individual women and men as well as gender categories in general. By exploiting rare access to large-scale, longitudinal hiring data from an online labor marketplace, we examine how employers’ interactions with workers shape their subsequent hiring preferences. Using linear probability models with job fixed effects, we find that employers prefer rehiring workers with whom they previously had positive interactions over unknown workers. Men workers benefit more than women workers from positive interactions, suggesting that these interactions decrease the influence of negative stereotypes about men’s trustworthiness. We additionally find that employers prefer hiring workers of the same gender as workers with whom they previously had positive interactions, suggesting that employers’ interactions with individual women and men shape their preferences for hiring women and men in general. These findings point to a nuanced theoretical relationship between employers’ interactions with workers and their social category preferences in hiring under conditions of immense uncertainty.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17383 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leading retailers have opened up their online storefronts to competitors by operating marketplaces for third-party sellers. We develop a model of entry and price competition at the product market level to analyze the competitive interactions arising within these retailer-led marketplaces. We show that the retailer benefits from the marketplace by mitigating his own capacity constraints and manages competition from third-party sellers through his control of the storefront: by setting the marketplace fee, by steering consumers, and by allocating his own capacity in response to the product supply choices of third-party sellers. We draw managerial implications and examine policy interventions. We find that regulation of marketplace fees has the strongest potential to increase welfare outcomes. Our model provides novel insights into the mechanisms at play in retailer-led marketplaces and explains their prominent role in online retail.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by H2020 European Research Council [Grant FAPoD 101044072]; Fundación Carmen y Severo Ochoa [Grant CEX2019-000915-S]; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad [Grant RYC-2016-20307]; BBVA Foundation grant within program “Ayudas Fundacion BBVA a Equipos de Investigacion Cientifica 2019.”</content>

    <title>A Blessing or a Curse? Teletriage Service in Healthcare</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Teletriage is a telehealth service that uses telecommunication technologies to remotely assess patients’ conditions and determine their needs for medical treatment. This paper examines how teletriage affects patients’ decisions to seek treatment and when healthcare providers (e.g., medical businesses, hospitals, or clinics) should launch teletriage services. Our findings reveal that teletriage can encourage more mild patients to seek treatment, discouraging more severe patients. This occurs when teletriage lacks sufficient precision and patients’ hassle cost of seeking treatment falls outside a moderate range. Specifically, when hassle costs are low, patients are generally inclined to seek treatment, but teletriage can misclassify severe patients, leading them to avoid necessary care. Conversely, when hassle costs are high, patients tend to stay home, yet teletriage can misidentify mild patients, prompting them to seek unnecessary treatment. As a result, even if teletriage is costless, healthcare providers may abandon this service even though teletriage always increases patient surplus by improving their assessment of their medical needs. Interestingly, patients can be better off seeking treatment from providers who charge higher prices as these providers are more likely to adopt teletriage services. These results caution healthcare policymakers that teletriage can exacerbate healthcare inefficiency instead of alleviating it. Nevertheless, to improve patient surplus, the government should sometimes subsidize providers to offer teletriage or allow providers to charge a higher treatment fee.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 71821001, 72325005] and the Blanche “Peg” Philpott Professorship.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03292 .</content>

    <title>Does Sponsored Search Advertising Augment Organic Search? Evidence from an E-Commerce Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides empirical evidence on the performance of sponsored search advertising in a case study of an unnamed e-commerce platform. I leverage a field experiment that blocks all sponsored search advertising for 3% of site visitors. The experiment shows that sponsored search advertising both steals business from organic listings and also reduces the total volume of transactions intermediated by the platform. However, in this case study, I find that sponsored search is nonetheless profitable for the platform because ad revenue more than compensates for the reduction in commissions that the platform earns on transactions.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04792 .</content>

    <title>Encounter Decisions for Patients With Diverse Sociodemographic Characteristics: Predictive Analytics of EMR Data From a Large Chain of Clinics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managing chronic diabetes care is a major challenge faced by healthcare organizations because it requires resource commitment over a long duration, high levels of patient engagement in the care process, and the socioeconomic and racial diversity of the patient population significantly affect care outcomes. Therefore, it is important to personalize chronic care treatment to improve chronic care outcomes. We propose a decision framework for the predictive management of diabetes that can help reduce the population‐level risk of diabetes. We use machine learning on clinical measures, demographics, and socioeconomic status of a large patient population from a chain of clinics in the Midwestern United States to predict the future health conditions of individual diabetes patients. Furthermore, we use the predictive analytic model outcome to build a decision analytic framework to optimally allocate encounters to individual patients. Also, we propose a heuristic solution to the optimal resource allocation model for implementation purposes. We make theoretical and methodological contributions by identifying and combining clinical, demographic, and socioeconomic factors to predict future diabetes risk for patients and demonstrate the use of the predicted risks for optimal resource utilization. Another significant contribution is demonstrating that a data‐driven predictive encounter allocation, considering the socioeconomic and demographic factors influencing health risks across patient populations, can promote more equitable healthcare delivery. Finally, we discuss implementation issues and actions.</content>

    <title>Future Making as Emancipatory Inquiry: A Value‐Based Exploration of Desirable Futures</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In theirPoint, Wenzel, Cabantous, and Koch set out how future making encompasses a broad range of future‐oriented practices, including but not limited to planning, foresight, agile, and design‐driven approaches. In thisCounterpoint, we contest that viewing future making as any future‐oriented practice may also encompass unsuitable and detrimental practices, and may blur the concept to the point of hindering, rather than sustaining efforts at theorizing future making. Adopting a Pragmatist perspective, we suggest viewing future making as an emancipatory inquiry aimed at imagining and reifying desirable futures, that is, collective, value‐based judgements of what the future might and should be. This entails a reflective conversation with the social and material world, whereby concerned actors collectively deliberate, based on values, what futures are desirable – for themselves, for future generations, and the natural environment. In advancing this view, we also reject Wright'sCounterpointon future making as a management fad that ignores long‐standing research on scenario planning, and instead, we argue that future making should depart from the managerialism of scenario planning. The main contribution of ourCounterpointis to suggest a theoretical perspective for advancing our understanding of how desirable futures can be crafted in practice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this research, we examine the common practice of employee performance rating calibration, the process in which calibration committee members discuss, compare, and potentially adjust direct supervisors' initial employee performance ratings. Calibration introduces an additional step into the performance evaluation process aimed at correcting for any incompleteness, inconsistencies, or biases in the ratings. By empirically studying archival, survey, and demographic data from 737 employees and 114 direct supervisors from our participating company, we examine the incentive conflicts between direct supervisors and the remainder of the calibration committee and their effect on the calibration process outcomes. We predict and find evidence consistent with direct supervisors being strategic in the information they share in the calibration process, which results in reduced information sharing. We also examine whose ratings are adjusted. While there is pressure on calibration committees to make sufficient adjustments, not every supervisor's employee performance ratings need to be adjusted. We find that those direct supervisors who have lower costs associated with avoiding scrutiny and defending against adjustments in the calibration process, ceteris paribus, receive fewer adjustments and end up with higher ratings, even when controlling for employee performance. Our investigation sheds light on the complexities of the calibration process, thereby providing important insights to HR managers responsible for managing the process.</content>

    <title>Exploring Cultural Differences in &lt;scp&gt;AI&lt;/scp&gt;‐Based Interviews: Innovativeness and Justice Perceptions Among Job Applicants in the United States and South Korea</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is rapidly integrated into the recruiting process across cultures. However, the extent to which job applicants' responses to AI‐based recruitment vary across cultures remains unexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a cross‐cultural examination on job applicants' perceptions of justice and innovativeness of AI‐based interviews, focusing on American and South Korean cultures. Using scenario experiments, we found that Americans generally perceived AI‐based interviews as less fair than human‐based interviews regarding job relatedness, chance to perform, and two‐way communication. In contrast, Koreans showed little difference in justice perceptions between AI‐based and human‐based interviews, and they even perceived AI‐based interviews as fairer in certain justice dimensions, such as the chance to perform. Both American and Korean participants regarded AI‐based interviews as more innovative than human‐based interviews. Additionally, we found that Americans' lower perceptions of justice, such as job relatedness and two‐way communication, accounted for the negative impact of AI‐based interviews on organizational attractiveness. However, Koreans' higher perceptions of the chance to perform and innovativeness led to higher organizational attractiveness in AI‐based interviews compared to that in human‐based interviews. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of culture in understanding job applicants' responses toward AI‐based interviews. Based on these findings, we discuss implications, limitations, and future suggestions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Higher-order beliefs—beliefs about others’ beliefs—may be important for trading behavior and asset prices but have received little systematic empirical examination. Examining more than 20 years of evidence from the Robert Shiller Investor Confidence surveys, we find that investors’ higher-order beliefs provide substantial motivations for nonfundamental speculation–taking a stock market position that conflicts with one’s valuation of the market. To explore the equilibrium implications, we construct a model that matches the survey evidence and highlights that investors’ higher-order beliefs amplify stock market overreaction and excess volatility.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The U.S. stock market’s return during the first month of a quarter correlates strongly with returns in future months, but the correlation is negative if the future month is the first month of a quarter, and positive if it isn’t. These correlations offset, consistent with the well-known near-zero unconditional autocorrelation, yet they are pervasive, present across industries and countries. The pattern accords with a model in which investors extrapolate announced earnings to predict future earnings, not recognizing that earnings in the first month of a quarter are discretely less predictable than in prior months. Survey data support the model. (JEL G12, G14, G40)</content>

    <title>Network-Motivated Forbearance Lending</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops a theoretical framework for network-motivated forbearance lending, or forbearance lending to influential buyers and sellers in a supply network. Because dominant banks in a financial market internalize the negative externality of an influential firm’s exit, they may continue to refinance a loss-making influential firm at an interest rate lower than the prime rate. This type of forbearance lending is distinct from other strategies such as evergreening or gambling for resurrection, and we show that network-motivated forbearance lending is independent of the financial soundness of the bank and can be welfare improving. To evaluate the extent of the externality of an influential seller or buyer, we propose two measures: the price influence coefficient and the demand influence coefficient, respectively.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the Seimeikai Foundation; the Seoul National University Institute of Economic Research, Housing and Commercial Bank Economic Research Fund; the Nomura Foundation; and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [Grants 15K01217, 16K13367, 17K03818, 20K20511, 23243050, 26245037, 26590051].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00459 .</content>

    <title>Does Employer-Paid, Job-Protected Maternity Leave Help or Hurt Female IT Workers? Evidence from Millions of Job Applications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Paid maternity leave is considered an important pathway to increasing women’s participation in information technology (IT), as it helps address work-family balance concerns, which are pronounced in the field due to long hours, travel, and the need to keep up with technology. Many governments require that employers pay for maternity leave. Using microlevel data on millions of applications from an online job portal, our study examines whether a policy change in India that expanded employer-paid, job-protected maternity leave for companies with 10 or more employees from short-term (12 weeks) to medium-term (26 weeks) changes companies’ likelihood of considering female applicants for IT jobs. Specifically, postlegislation, we expect that less profitable companies may penalize women in the hiring process because employers must bear the costs associated with providing maternity benefits; we find that women were ∼22% less likely to be invited for an interview, postlegislation, at companies with low profitability. Moreover, at such companies, we do not observe a postlegislation change in applications by women. These results identify an important source of leakage in the pipeline for female IT workers. Additionally, our study suggests that legislation which mandates that maternity leave be paid for by employers (50% of economies that guarantee maternity leave of 14 weeks or longer require that employers fully or partially pay for maternity leave) should be accompanied by the introduction and enforcement of associated laws and guardrails—for example, parental leave and antidiscriminatory laws—to ensure that the spirit of the maternity leave legislation is upheld.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: Financial support from the National Science Foundation [Award 2151311] and Bright Data [in-kind contributions] is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.00380 .</content>

    <title>Mitigating the Negative Effects of Customer Anxiety by Facilitating Access to Human Contact</title>
    <updated>2025-03-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research in social psychology has shown that when people feel anxious, they seek advice from others. Yet, companies that operate in high-anxiety settings (like financial services, healthcare, and education) are increasingly deploying self-service technologies (SSTs), through which anxious customers transact without access to human contact. These companies may therefore face a classic efficiency–service trade-off where gains in operational efficiency through automation also hamper service outcomes by neglecting customer anxiety. This paper, set in the high-anxiety domain of financial services, investigates the value of facilitating access to human contact during SST usage. In a field experiment conducted within the context of a credit union’s SST loan-approval process, an invitation to connect with a human loan agent increases the customer uptake rate of approved loans by 24%. Subsequent controlled laboratory experiments, which explicitly investigate the linkages among anxiety, choice satisfaction, and firm trust during SST encounters show that compared with participants without anxiety, those who are anxious consistently report lower satisfaction with their choices and less trust in the firm, regardless of the source of their anxiety. When anxiety is related to the SST encounter, facilitating access to human contact dampens anxiety’s negative effects on choice satisfaction and, by extension, increases firm trust. We further observe that these benefits of facilitating access to human contact arise even though very few customers choose to access a person. Taken together, this research reveals an opportunity for firms to maintain operational efficiency in high-anxiety self-service settings without compromising customer experiences and service outcomes.This paper was accepted by Charles Corbett, operations management.Funding: Funding for this research, apart from internal business costs incurred by our field study partner to support the experiment, was primarily provided by Harvard Business School and partially provided by Dartmouth College.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01029 .</content>

    <title>Expanding the Caring Capacity: An Integrative Review of Nontraditional Caregiving and the Workplace Caregiving Literature</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Management scholarship has long explored how life outside of work impacts work, and it has accumulated rich theoretical insights on how being a mother or father impacts one’s job and the organization. Importantly, however, this literature has adopted a limited scope of who and what caregiving embodies, overlooking the millions of workers globally who find themselves caring for a parent, a person with a disability, or someone who faces unique marginalization. We use new research on nontraditional caregiving (NTC) roles to enrich the topic of caregiving more broadly. As such, we provide an integrative review of 353 multidisciplinary workplace articles to detail the workplace outcomes explored in the literature and identify four caregiving dimensions that cannot be fully understood by a traditional caregiving framework alone. Further, we build a multilevel framework that identifies novel processes across roles, thereby bridging the nontraditional and traditional caregiving literatures and introducing ways to redirect future research. Overall, this review aims to show that caregiving should be viewed more broadly than it is currently, and this review aims to build a foundation for better understanding the complexities of caregiving in all its forms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The reordering of transactions from “high‐to‐low” is a controversial bank practice thought to maximize fees paid by low‐income customers on overdrawn accounts. We exploit a series of class‐action lawsuits that mandated that some banks cease the practice. Using alternative credit bureau data, we find that after banks cease high‐to‐low reordering, low‐income individuals reduce payday borrowing, increase consumption, realize long‐term improvements in financial health, and gain access to lower‐cost loans in the traditional financial system. These findings suggest that aggressive bank practices can create demand for alternative financial services and highlight an important link between the traditional and alternative financial systems.</content>

    <title>Tournaments of Destruction: Consumers Battling for Visibility</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research introduces tournaments of destruction, defined as staged and ritualized social performances involving entertainment and competitive rivalry in which consumers destroy valued material objects before a focused gathering. The conceptualization of tournaments of destruction is borne from a qualitative, phenomenological-based case study of low-income, low-power Black African male youth, who as members of the Izikhothane subculture in Soweto, South Africa, battle powerless anonymity by engaging in conspicuous consumption and the counterintuitive conspicuous destruction of high-end Italian apparel brands. Alexander’s theory of social performance provides an enabling lens to explore tournaments of destruction within a system of meanings, and findings provide insights about motivation to participate in a destructive subculture, the social performance of tournaments of destruction, and the agency and navigation of visibility within their hyper-local community. Emergent themes of spatiotemporal visibility, intentionality of destruction, focused gatherings and collective effervescence, and sociomoral condemnation contribute to understanding tournaments of destruction and other destructive enactments by social collectives both in pre-market and contemporary societies. This research extends Alexander’s theory of social performance and provides grounding for future work on destruction and visibility within contemporary consumer culture.</content>

    <title>How Algorithms Constrain Consumer Experience</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior literature is yet to explain how algorithms systematically constrain consumer experience (CX). To address this issue, we conducted a multi-method ethnographic study of consumers using fitness tracking software. We draw on the information science literature to demonstrate that the constitutive properties of information technology (IT) that underlie algorithms result in a set of restrictive fundamental interactional mechanisms imposed through algorithmic logics of legibility (what is selectively registered as input), visibility (what is selectively represented in output), and legitimacy (normative commitments embedded in input and output choices). We find that these mechanisms systematically constrain the distinct dimensions of the CX construct by eliciting consumption work. Consumers perform cognitive work to think through algorithmic limitations, practical work to accommodate those limitations, relational work to clarify algorithmic misrepresentation, and affective work to deal with algorithmic delegitimization. We make two contributions. First, our emergent framework not only demonstrates how algorithms systematically constrain CX, but is also more broadly relevant to consumer research because it enables accounting for the agency of IT. Second, we provide a corrective to the passive, emotion focused, view of CX by demonstrating how the consumption work of accommodating algorithmic limitations constrains the distinct dimensions of the CX construct.</content>

    <title>On the heels of giants: Internal network structure and the race to build on prior innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Strategy research has long been concerned with how firms build on the technological knowledge they create, and has focused on legal enforcement, complementary assets, and location decisions. Less attention has been paid to how internal firm structures support the appropriation of future cumulative innovations: what has been termed “generative appropriability.” Drawing on innovation and social network research, we propose that more integrated intrafirm inventor networks, and those with nearly decomposable structures, facilitate generative appropriability by accelerating within‐firm generation of follow‐on innovations, thus outpacing rivals. We find evidence for these effects in patent data from 1417 large corporations over 26 years. The acceleration effect is strongest in the critical first few years after an initial invention.Managerial SummaryInnovation is a cumulative and competitive process, so if firms fail to build on their own innovations quickly, rivals will capture value by doing so. We study how the degree to which a firm's inventors are connected to each other through co‐patenting relationships is related to its ability to build on its prior innovations faster than rivals. We find that firms whose researchers are connected to more of its other researchers are better able to quickly develop follow‐on innovations, but this advantage decays over time. We also find that the pattern of connectedness most associated with this outcome is one in which tight clusters of researchers in the core of the network are linked to each other by “bridging ties.”</content>

    <title>Undiversity, Inequity, and Exclusion in Supply Chains: The Unintended Fallout of Economic Sanctions and Consumer Boycotts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economic sanctions and consumer boycotts are common tools to punish organizations for undesirable behavior and attempt to coerce them to change their actions. However, these tools occasionally spill over beyond the intended recipients and affect guiltless supply chain members, jeopardizing the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion in supply chains. This study identifies four channels through which sanctions and boycotts propagate through supply chains. In particular, supply chain members can be affected by direct relationships with targeted organizations, disruptions in accessing foreign markets, inability to access technology, and logistics failures. Potential solutions include mapping supply chains, proactive cooperation, network analysis, and shortening supply chains. While the work provides a general framework for research and practitioners, it also identifies areas for further studies, such as the role of new technologies and the effect of sanctions and boycotts on supply chain sustainability.</content>

    <title>Thirty Years of Managerial Mental Representations: A Review Guiding Conceptualization and Future Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managerial mental representations (MMRs) are mental constructs that structure cognitive content to guide perception and interpretation. MMRs have been examined across a broad spectrum of management research contexts, leading to the use of numerous related terms such as “mental representation,” “schema,” “mental model,” “cognitive frame,” “cognitive map,” and “mindset.” This proliferation of terms has caused considerable definitional overlap and ambiguity. To foster definitional clarity, this review systematically analyzes 206 articles employing any of 33 MMR terms used during the past 30 years. We identify the conceptual and functional definition facets of MMRs and use them to analyze commonalities and differences among the most prominent MMR terms. We further examine both established and emerging discussions surrounding the characteristics of MMRs. Established discussions focus on MMR content and levels of analysis, while emerging discussions explore MMR permanence and implicitness. We propose suggestions to advance each conversation. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we create a guiding framework aiding future research to conceptualize MMRs and navigate terminology choices. Finally, we propose two future research directions: integrating the content and process perspectives on MMRs and applying an MMR lens to examine the emergence of artificial intelligence in organizations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines venture capital's (VC) role in the geographic clustering of high‐growth startups. We exploit a rule change that disproportionately impacted U.S. regions that historically lacked VC financing via a restriction of banks to invest in the asset class. A one‐standard‐deviation increase in VCs' exposure to the rule led to a 20% decline in fund size and a 10% decrease in the likelihood of raising a follow‐on fund. Startups were not wholly cushioned: financing and valuations declined. Startups also moved out of impacted states after the rule change, likely exacerbating existing geographic disparity in entrepreneurship.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We exploit quasi-exogenous variation in passive ownership around the Russell 1000/2000 cutoff to explore the causal effects of passive ownership on the securities lending market. We find that passive ownership causes an increase in lendable supply and short interest, while lending fees remain largely unchanged. The utilization ratio—ie, the ratio of short interest over lendable supply—goes up, implying that shorting demand increases more than lendable supply. We argue that this additional demand results from an increase in the quality of lendable supply as passive funds are less likely to recall stock loans. This higher supply quality attracts informed short sellers, who improve the information efficiency around negative news releases and correct overpricing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ethnically diverse countries are more prone to conflict, but why do some groups engage in conflict, while others do not? I show that civil conflict in Africa is explained by ethnic groups’ cultural distance to the central government: an increase in cultural distance, proxied by linguistic distance, increases an ethnicity’s propensity to fight over government power. To identify this effect, I leverage within-ethnicity variation in linguistic distance resulting from power transitions between ethnic groups over time. I provide evidence that the effects can be attributed to differences in preferences over both the allocation and the type of public goods. (JEL D74, H41, J15, N47, O15, O17, Z13)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores global perceptions and understanding of climate change and policies, examining factors that influence support for climate action and the impact of different types of information. We conduct large-scale surveys with 40,000 respondents from 20 countries, providing new international data on attitudes toward climate change and respondents’ socioeconomic backgrounds and lifestyles. We identify three key perceptions affecting policy support: perceived effectiveness of policies in reducing emissions, their impact on low-income households, and their effect on respondents’ households (self-interest). Educational videos clarifying policy mechanisms increase support for climate policies; those merely highlighting climate change’s impacts do not. (JEL C83, D83, D91, Q54, Q58)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a new model of stochastic choice that assigns each choice option a utility, along with a salience parameter reflecting economic frictions. We characterize our model behaviorally and investigate its comparative statics properties. We show that the model generates intuitive closed-form solutions in equilibrium settings where firms can choose price, quality, and advertising. In addition, we show that the model allows for flexible substitution patterns and changes in market shares across choice sets. We demonstrate that our model can be easily identified and can outperform alternatives in demand prediction. (JEL D11, D21, D43, M37)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The transition toward an intangible-intensive economy reshapes financial systems by creating a self-perpetuating savings glut in the production sector. As intangibles become increasingly important, firms hoard liquidity to finance investment in intangibles of limited pledgeability. Firms’ savings feed cheap leverage to financial intermediaries and allow intermediaries to bid up asset prices, which in turn encourages firms to save more for asset creation. This paper develops a macrofinance model that offers a coherent account of rising corporate savings, debt-fueled growth of intermediaries, declining interest rates, and rising asset valuation. Along these secular trends, endogenous financial risk accumulates. (JEL E43, E44, G12, G21, G31, G32)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I present a new theory of oligopoly and markups in general equilibrium, based on an innovative, scalable hedonic demand system, which I take to the data for the universe of US public firms. In my model, firms compete in a network of product market rivalries that emerge endogenously out of the characteristics of the products they supply. I estimate that consumer surplus is almost three times as large as profits; decompose firm-level markups into metrics of quality-adjusted productivity and market centrality; and analyze the extent, evolution, and drivers of monopoly power in the United States between 1995 and 2021.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How quickly does a fiat money become valueless? I study the speculative hyperinflation equilibria of continuous-time economies with decentralized markets where money is essential. I establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which money dies in finite time. A necessary condition is that the liquidity return of money grows unbounded as the value of money approaches zero. Under CRRA preferences, the longevity of money shrinks with the money growth rate and the frequency of liquidity needs, but it increases with seller’s market power. Money duration also depends on the strictness of legal restrictions and the rates of return of competing currencies. (JEL E31, E42, E51, E52, E62)</content>

    <title>Trade Shocks and Credit Reallocation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper identifies a credit-supply contraction that arises endogenously after trade liberalization. Banks with loan portfolios concentrated in sectors exposed to competition from China face an increase in nonperforming loans after China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. As a result, they reduce the supply of credit to firms, irrespective of the firm’s sector of operation. This cut in credit translates into lower employment, investment, and output. Through this mechanism, the financial channel amplifies the shock to firms already hit by import competition from China and passes it on to firms in sectors expected to expand upon trade liberalization.

    <title>EXPRESS: Optimal Processing and Trading for a Commodity in the Presence of Inventory Conversion Flexibility and Random Supply</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we present a decision support system used by an agricultural cooperative in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to purchase, blend, sell, and store groundnut to maximize profits. The cooperative purchases raw groundnuts (input commodity) from its member-farmers, which is then processed to obtain multiple grades of groundnut seeds (output commodity). After the processing, two grades may be blended to obtain an intermediate grade to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. The cooperative then sells some or all the output commodity in the spot market and carries the remaining inventory to the following period. It faces the problem of determining the quantity of input commodity to process and the quantity of different grades of output commodity to blend and, subsequently, sell in every period. The novel features of the problem are that the supply of input commodity is random every period, which is caused by the obligation of the cooperative to purchase all the supply that its members bring, and the option to blend grades to create intermediate ones. The possibility of blending over a multi-period planning horizon has not been examined yet in the operations management literature on commodities. We formulate the problem as a dynamic program over a harvest season and use the associated framework to identify structural properties of the optimal value function and optimal decisions. We show that the optimal value function is not separable in the input inventory and the output inventory vector. This makes the identification of the optimal solution challenging. In special cases, the value function may have a simpler form, for example, when blending is not permitted. We develop an efficient procedure to compute the optimal decisions in the general case. We illustrate the benefits of blending and using a multi-period model, employing data obtained from a cooperative: the net profit of the cooperative could improve by 100-900% depending upon the model parameters, which translates to Indian National Rupees 1.94-17.46 million per annum.</content>

    <title>Undiversity, Inequity, and Exclusion in Supply Chains: The Unintended Fallout of Economic Sanctions and Consumer Boycotts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economic sanctions and consumer boycotts are common tools to punish organizations for undesirable behavior and attempt to coerce them to change their actions. However, these tools occasionally spill over beyond the intended recipients and affect guiltless supply chain members, jeopardizing the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion in supply chains. This study identifies four channels through which sanctions and boycotts propagate through supply chains. In particular, supply chain members can be affected by direct relationships with targeted organizations, disruptions in accessing foreign markets, inability to access technology, and logistics failures. Potential solutions include mapping supply chains, proactive cooperation, network analysis, and shortening supply chains. While the work provides a general framework for research and practitioners, it also identifies areas for further studies, such as the role of new technologies and the effect of sanctions and boycotts on supply chain sustainability.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Protecting Workers from Rude Customers to Enhance Organizational Identification in Emotional Labor Environments: a Study with Call Center Agents</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Challenges faced by call centers in managing capacity, efficiency, service speed and quality, training, emotional labor, and turnover are intrinsically intertwined. Call center agents are considered frontline workers, and as such, they often deal with hostile behavior from rude customers. However, they are expected to suppress their feelings and maintain a courteous demeanor despite rude customer behavior, which results in emotional dissonance. Such working environments, where the frontline workers experience emotional dissonance, are termed emotional labor environments. Emotional dissonance, if sustained over a long period of time, can lead to an erosion of organizational identification (OID) amongst agents, unless they perceive adequate protection and support from the management. A low OID can lead to high employee turnover, which in turn results in high recruitment and training costs as well as loss of experience and compromised service quality. In this study, we examine how employee protection policies and leadership style manifest in mitigating the erosion of OID. We develop a research framework to understand the mediating role of agents' perception of the efficacy of the firm's policies to protect them from rude customers and the relevant aspects of the servant leadership style of supervisors in mitigating the erosion of agents' OID caused by the cumulative emotional dissonance over their tenure duration. For this study, we partner with a major multinational firm in Korea in the insurance industry. We find that the perceived organizational support for protection from rude customers and supervisors' servant leadership style are positively related to agents' OID. The agent's OIDdecreaseswith their tenure duration, unless mediated by the agent's perception of the efficacy of protection from rude customers. We provide insights for the retention of agents with implications for capacity and service quality for the call centers. These insights may be extended to frontline workers in other emotional labor environments.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Strategizing Value-Added Services for Platform Firms</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Platform firms are increasingly investing in value-added services (VAS), believing these investments in VAS universally contribute to their success. Although many studies have examined platform firms’ core services (e.g., intermediation), systematic analyses of VAS provision strategies remain limited. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretic model to analyze (1) the conditions under which platform firms benefit from providing VAS and (2) to which side(s) platform firms should provide VAS. We offer several insights. First, variable service costs are a critical yet previously neglected factor in governing platform firms’ VAS provision. Second, a comparison of equilibrium outcomes across three VAS provision strategies—one-sided unidirectional, two separate unidirectional, and bidirectional—reveals that the optimal strategy is jointly determined by variable service costs, cross-network externalities, and the asymmetry in the benefits of bidirectional VAS to the two platform sides. Specifically, when asymmetry is low, bidirectional VAS is optimal. When asymmetry is high, platform firms should provide unidirectional VAS to one side, considering the second side only when variable service costs are low or cross-network externalities are significant. Third, we explore the implications of VAS provision strategies for platform firms’ investment and pricing decisions. For example, when platform firms provide two separate unidirectional VAS, these investments are complementary. VAS could incentivize platform firms to offer price subsidies to one side of the platform. Finally, optimal VAS provision strategies do not always increase consumer surplus.</content>

    <title>Rationally Trust, but Emotionally? The Roles of Cognitive and Affective Trust in Laypeople's Acceptance of AI for Preventive Care Operations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare operations. Nevertheless, particularly in the context of preventive care, little is known about how laypeople perceive and accept AI and change their behavior accordingly. Grounded in a solid theoretical framework of trust, this study bridges this gap by exploring individuals’ acceptance of AI‐based preventive health interventions and following health behavior change, which is critical for preventive care providers’ operational and business performance. Through a randomized field experiment with 15,000 users of a mobile health app complemented by a survey, we first show that the use and disclosure of AI in preventive health interventions improve their effectiveness. However, individuals are less likely to accept and achieve the health behavior change suggested by AI than when they receive similar interventions from health experts. We also observe that the effectiveness of AI‐based interventions can be improved by combining them with human expert opinions, increasing their algorithmic transparency, or emphasizing their genuine care and warmth. These results collectively suggest that, different from conventional technologies, AI's deficient affective trust, rather than comparable cognitive trust, play a decisive role in the acceptance of AI‐based preventive health interventions. This study sheds light on the literature on the role of new‐age information technologies in behavioral operations management, consumer marketing, and healthcare as well as the role of trust in technology acceptance. Valuable practical implications for more effective management of AI for preventive care operations and promotion of consumers’ health behavior are also provided.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Political Uncertainty and the Timing of Mass Layoffs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the relation between political uncertainty arising from state-level election cycles and the timing of employee dismissal and plant closure notices filed by U.S. firms under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act of 1988 (hereafter, WARN notices). We appeal to a real options framework to predict that firms delay layoff decisions and the issuance of WARN notices until the resolution of political uncertainty. Using establishment-level data on layoffs disclosed in WARN notices and state elections occurring between 1994 and 2022, we document that the likelihood of issuing WARN notices declines during the election quarter but increases in the subsequent quarter. Cross-sectional findings show that political uncertainty plays a significant role in the timing of WARN notices during election periods while other factors, including partisanship, economic conditions, union strength, and firm visibility, may also play a role. Further, firms that delay WARN notices do not experience a significant deterioration in their medium-term financial performance. Overall, our findings provide evidence that firms delay labor adjustment decisions and the announcements of such decisions in response to political uncertainty.</content>

    <title>B2B Online Sales Pushes: Whether, When, and Why They Enhance Sales Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Business‐to‐business (B2B) sellers are increasingly transitioning to hybrid sales structures, by augmenting an in‐person field sales force with a direct online channel. During this transition, sellers frequently experience a cold‐start problem, wherein existing customers are either not acquainted with the online channel or unconvinced of its usefulness and are therefore reluctant to adopt it. To overcome the cold‐start problem, B2B sellers are increasingly relying ononline sales pushes, which are efforts to encourage salespeople to nudge customers to adopt the online channel for certain buying tasks. Yet, because salespeople may fear that the online channel adoption jeopardizes the very relationships that they painstakingly built, the salespeople's compliance with an online sales push remains unclear. To glean insight into this dilemma, we empirically investigate an online sales push's impact on salesperson effort (re)allocation and sales performance. Based on an econometric analysis of archival data from a B2B seller and a scenario‐based experiment, we conclude that salespeople generally tend to comply with an online sales push because it frees up their time and allows them to pursue new selling opportunities that have the potential to increase their compensation. The results also indicate that following an online sales push, salespeople expend their effort based on a customer's online proclivity and potential prior to the push. Moreover, the effort expended varies over time and across communication channels. Additionally, the analysis reveals (a) asymmetric carryover and cross‐channel effects of communication effort and sales performance and (b) asymmetric synergistic effects of communication effort on sales performance.</content>

    <title>Analytics for IoT‐Enabled Human–Robot Hybrid Sortation: An Online Optimization Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by a realworld practice of a China Post sortation center, this study considers the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) technology to improve the efficiency of a human–robot hybrid sortation system. In this system, IoT technology enables responsive adjustment of the manual capacity to alleviate the congestion effect of increasing parcel flow on robotic sorting efficiency. We begin with a predictive analysis of a real‐life dataset to quantify the congestion effect on robotic sorting efficiency, and examine the nonstationary behavior of the parcel flow process. Subsequently, we design an online algorithm using IoT advance information (which refers to advance observation of some parcel flows before their actual arrivals) for efficiently adjusting the manual capacity. We develop theoretical guarantee for the effectiveness of the online algorithm by bounding its regret, and also demonstrate that the long‐term expected regret rate is zero under mild conditions. Via extensive simulation experiments, we find that our online algorithm outperforms the China Post sortation center's current policy and conventional Markov dynamic program in terms of computational efficiency and solution quality. The simulation results also demonstrate that the value of IoT technology to the sortation center can be significant, and shed insights on IoT investment by revealing the diminishing return of expanding the horizon of IoT advance information.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the emerging mixed autonomous paradigm in cobotic order picking operations, we investigate the optimal information design to navigate human workers (HWs) who cooperate with autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) within an intralogistics system. We incorporate asymmetric information between AMRs and HWs in a routing game where connected AMRs are informed of the congestion state while HWs rely on information provided by the system. The system designs a communication policy aiming to navigate HWs away from congestion. Without strategic communications, we show that the deployment of AMRs cannot mitigate congestion unless the automation level reaches a threshold. Interestingly, we illustrate a substitution effect between automation and strategic communications when information distortion is mild. In contrast, severe information distortion complements automation due to exacerbated congestion. Furthermore, an in‐house AMR fleet is economically more efficient than a third‐party logistics service. Consequently, in‐house automation can be achieved with mild information distortion, while severe information distortion is required to complement the lack of efficiency in the third‐party AMR fleet. With simulated numerical examples to complement the analytical results, we provide managerial insights concerning the optimal information policies under different levels of automation, guiding warehouse managers in their communications with workers to achieve the best performance of the cobotic system.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Manufacturer’s Role in Nanostore-Supermarket Supply Chain Competition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore retail supply chains in emerging markets in which a manufacturer can reach consumers by selling its product through very small independent stores (nanostores) and/or through a supermarket. Nanostores offer consumers the advantage of proximity, but supermarkets offer the advantage of bulk buying. We explore the competition between the supermarket and nanostores and examine the manufacturer’s role in shaping the retail market structure for its product through wholesale price contracts. We model and analyze a multi-party supply-chain game in which a manufacturer can sell its product to spatially-distributed, utility-maximizing, price-sensitive consumers through nanostores and a supermarket. Consumers can buy in bulk at the supermarket, optimizing their purchase quantity, and hence visit frequency, in an Economic Order Quantity type approach, or they can purchase from a nanostore (frequently due to store storage-space limitations). We fully solve for the equilibrium market structure and the associated retail and wholesale prices, establishing that the manufacturer’s desired channel strategy is governed by three factors: the manufacturer-nanostore supply chain cost, the manufacturer-supermarket supply chain cost, and the supermarket bargaining power. If the supply chain efficiencies are somewhat similar, then the manufacturer should (typically, but not always) use both retail formats to avail of the nanostore advantage in serving proximate consumers and the supermarket advantage in serving distant customers. The specifics of how the manufacturer should use the retail formats will depend on the supermarket power. Among other results, we establish that aggregate nanostore demand and profit can decrease in nanostore density and that the presence of a high-power supermarket can increase consumer surplus because the manufacturer induces strong price competition.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media users generate a variety of content that can potentially influence their followers’ behaviors and preferences. However, most user-generated content, such as text and images, is unstructured, making it difficult to analyze how individuals impact the creation of such data as existing models primarily focus on the numerical aspects of behavioral data. In this paper, we propose a method to identify influential users who significantly affect others’ interest in content topics, with a specific focus on text and images. Our study introduces a new variant of the topic model, incorporating a hierarchical structure and a vector auto-regressive approach. This method accounts for both the evolution of topic distribution and the social influence among users on their interest in content topics. The empirical application of our model to image-sharing social media data demonstrates that our model outperforms conventional topic models in terms of predictive accuracy and topic interpretability. Moreover, we illustrate how visualizing the estimated social influence within the network can provide valuable insights for seeded marketing campaigns and data-driven product development by identifying influential users in various content areas. This approach also offers a deeper understanding of evolving trends in content, preferences, and demand.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper summarizes emerging practice and research issues in the health insurance industry. We provide an industry overview, epitomize business analytics applications, and outline current and emerging problems of interest to key stakeholders and researchers in information systems, operations management, and healthcare management. Specifically, we focus on three areas of research that are of importance to the health insurance industry as well as the healthcare system: (i) management and evaluation of intervention programs, (ii) creation of effective provider networks, and (iii) emerging issues such as the impact of a pandemic, patient communication and steering, and technological innovations in health care. We lay out brief details of how each of these problems can be formulated, where the data can be acquired (public and/or proprietary data sets), and provide guidance for solving them. For several of these problems, we provide models that span causal modeling, predictive modeling, and prescriptive modeling.</content>

    <title>Shaping Ecosystem Rules: Complementarities, Interdependencies, and Firms’ Success in Coordinating Ecosystems Via Standard-Setting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In ecosystems characterized by distributed authority, each firm competes with others to shape the ecosystem’s rules to its advantage while navigating complex interorganizational interdependencies. This creates a coordination problem best exemplified within consensus standards-setting organizations, where different firms present technical proposals and attempt to shape the specifications that dictate how the ecosystem’s technological components must work together. In this paper, we examine what factors determine a firm’s shaping success in such contexts by integrating two major perspectives, one rooted in interfirm social relations and the other that views an ecosystem as a structure of technological interdependence. In so doing, we identify a socio-technical trade-off between the extent of a firm’s relational influence and its efforts to shape core technical proposals (i.e., those that affect many interdependent ecosystem components). A firm with many existing relational ties holds influence that increases its success at shaping, but if such a firm’s proposals are at the core, some of its partners will invariably face high adjustment costs because of the proposal’s wide-ranging impact. Interestingly, a firm with greater prospects for engaging with future complementary partners does not face this trade-off and indeed benefits from shaping at the core. Additionally, value capture considerations also affect how other firms weigh these socio-technical trade-offs, with support for the firm’s shaping attempts dampened among potential future complementors but strengthened among current partners. We provide evidence for these arguments by applying machine-learning techniques on fine-grained data from two prominent wireless telecommunications standards. Our work brings a fresh perspective to a growing ecosystems literature by illuminating both social and technological factors that affect firms’ shaping success.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.16136 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the rise of digital platforms that connect rural entrepreneurs to urban customers, rural online businesses are hampered by a lack of talent. Some have pointed to the potentially enabling role of rural returnees. However, although international returnees bring valuable knowledge to businesses in their home countries, it is unclear how domestic returnees affect entrepreneurship in rural, underdeveloped parts of their country. We study this question using a natural experiment involving a regional policy change, which reduced the barriers for rural migrants to return home in one Chinese province but not in others. We find that, after the policy change, rural e-commerce businesses in the province that implemented the policy change enjoyed a 19% performance gain relative to those in other provinces. We theorize and test four mechanisms that may underlie the relationship between return migration and online entrepreneurship: knowledge transfer, demand spillover, de novo businesses, and financial support from returnees. Our results support the knowledge transfer mechanism, but we also find evidence of demand spillover. This study highlights the salience of return mobility and “return barriers” in shaping local entrepreneurship. It also suggests a novel approach toward fostering entrepreneurship in underdeveloped regions: policymakers and digital platforms may work together to pave the country roads that take people home.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2021.16002 .</content>

    <title>Revisiting the CEO Effect Through a Machine Learning Lens</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An important debated topic in strategic management concerns the so-called “chief executive officer (CEO) effect,” which quantifies the impact that CEOs have on the performance of the firms that they lead. Prior literature has empirically investigated the CEO effect and found support for both theses: a significant effect and no effect at all. We note, however, that virtually all prior studies have relied on an empirical specification that leverages in-sample data, which could be unreliable in certain circumstances. In this paper, we utilize machine learning models and predictive analytics based on out-of-sample data to revisit the CEO effect. In particular, we operationalize the CEO effect as the gain in the out-of-sample predictive accuracy by adding the CEO information to the model input in addition to the firm information. By analyzing 1,245 firms and 1,779 CEOs over 20 years, we demonstrate that the results of the approach from the literature have limited external validity. More specifically, we convey that the analyses are purely based on in-sample data and that the predictive effects of CEOs are not substantive when out-of-sample test data sets are used. Although our main analysis relies on optimized distributed gradient boosting, we also conduct extensive robustness tests spanning close to 100 models with alternative algorithms and specifications, all of which yield consistent results.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03625 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: How Awe in Marketing Communications Decreases Consumer Preferences for Limited Edition Products</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Awe is commonly employed in marketing communications given its powerful ability to inspire consumers. Despite the prevalent use of awe in advertising limited edition (LE) products, research has yet to examine when and how awe can benefit or hurt these promotional efforts. Findings across nine studies demonstrate that awe typically has a negative impact on consumer engagement and product preferences toward LE items. This effect results from the reduced desire for exclusivity that a consumer has when experiencing awe. These findings are generalized to several contexts, including a field study of persuasive communications and consumer choices in a metaverse environment. However, awe can enhance consumer preferences toward LE products when promotional messages are framed to reduce this incongruence. We provide insights for marketers on the conditions under which incorporating awe in LE product campaigns might prove beneficial or counterproductive.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Artificial Intelligence on Call: The Physician's Decision of Whether to Use AI in Clinical Practice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Physicians are increasingly able to use artificial intelligence (AI) systems to aid their medical decision-making. This paper examines a physician’s decision regarding whether to use an assistive AI system when prescribing a treatment plan for a patient. Using AI helps the physician generate an informative signal that lessens clinical uncertainty. It can also change the physician’s legal liability in the event of patient harm. We analyze two patient-protection schemes that determine physician liability when using AI: the prevailing patient-protection scheme uses the AI signal to enforce the current standard of care, whereas an emerging scheme proposes using the AI signal as the new standard of care. We show that in both schemes, the physician has an incentive to use AI in low-uncertainty scenarios, even if AI provides little value. Furthermore, the physician may avoid using AI in higher-uncertainty scenarios where AI could have aided in better decision-making. As AI becomes more precise, the physician may become more hesitant to use it on certain patients. A comparison of the physician’s decision to use AI under the two schemes reveals that using the AI signal as the new standard of care may mitigate AI underuse (overuse) for certain patients but may boost AI underuse (overuse) for some other patients.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Strategic Change Capability in Marketing Organizations: Conceptualization, Scale Development, and Validation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In dynamic and uncertain business environments, marketing organizations need to be constantly ready to enact strategic changes. However, a robust measure for capturing the organizational capabilities and underlying marketing activities required to achieve effective marketing-related strategic changes is lacking. This study addresses this gap by developing a measurement tool for strategic change capability (SCC). Drawing on interviews with marketing consultants and senior marketing managers, the authors conceptualize SCC as a multidimensional dynamic marketing capability that comprises five dimensions: establishing the business case for change, preparing employees for change, setting up the organization for implementing change, institutionalizing change, and assessing and adjusting implementation. Following rigorous scale development procedures, including (1) item generation, (2) expert evaluation, (3) scale purification, (4) scale validity, (5) nomological and predictive validity, and (6) scale generalizability studies, a psychometrically sound and reliable measure of SCC is developed. The SCC scale facilitates different types of strategic marketing change and predicts performance outcomes better than established constructs (i.e., strategic flexibility, agility, adaptiveness, and responsiveness). This study contributes to the dynamic capabilities theory and provides empirically substantiated guidance for marketing organizations on how to prepare for and effectively enact strategic changes in dynamic business environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The sharing economy has become an increasingly widespread way for peers to rent out their owned goods to others seeking to rent them. This research investigates how providers (i.e., owners renting out their belongings) decide what price to charge, and identifies theprovider WTA effect, where in the context of a peer-to-peer (P2P) collaborative consumption model, providers are willing to accept (WTA)lessthan renters (i.e., non-owners) are willing to pay (WTP). These findings diverge from prior research which has repeatedly demonstrated that owners typically demand more to part with their belongings than non-owners are willing to pay in a seller/buyer transaction (i.e., the endowment effect). Theprovider WTA effectis explained by providers having a more accessible empathy lens which in turn acts to dampen the accessibility of their exchange lens when renting out their item. This drives WTA below WTP. The effect is moderated when the renter is identified as a dissimilar transaction partner. This research provides actionable implications for providers and platforms.</content>

    <title>Do the People Make the Place? A 40-Year Review of Research on ASA Theory</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Attraction-selection-attrition (ASA) theory proposes that “the people make the place” and has served as a foundation for many areas of organizational research. In this review, we take stock of the ASA literature to identify what we know and what we need to know about ASA processes and their effects on organizations. Based on a review of over 6,000 articles that cited ASA, we identified 321 studies that used the theory as a basis for their hypotheses. However, only 77 (24%) of those studies actually tested an aspect of the theory. For example, although ASA is an organizational-level theory, most studies used the theory to test phenomena at other levels, such as individuals, teams, or occupations. Among studies that did test the theory, very few directly assessed its core hypotheses. For instance, only one published study directly tested the central hypothesis that ASA processes lead to homogeneity. Moreover, some parts of the theory were not supported. As an example, although the theory suggests that ASA processes will reduce organizational effectiveness, several studies found that homogeneity was associated with better performance. Although the amount of empirical support for ASA theory was uneven, we believe it still has the potential to help understand organizations and the people that make them. To that end, we provide an agenda for future research that prioritizes how to best test ASA’s core hypotheses. We also highlight connections between ASA and other theories and literatures that examine similar phenomena to inspire future research opportunities.</content>

    <title>Organizational-Level Training and Performance: A Meta-Analytic Investigation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While extensive research has examined the relationship between human resource management systems and organizational performance, the impact of organizational-level training—defined as the quantity and quality of training that an organization provides to its employees—remains less understood. In this article, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relationship between organizational-level training and organizational performance to determine the magnitude of the relationship and test a set of moderators of the relationship. Grounded in human capital theory, our meta-analysis employs a theoretically driven moderator analysis to identify the conditions under which organizational-level training significantly influences organizational performance. The results from 159 studies (N = 75,033) show that the relationship between organizational-level training and organizational performance is positive and significant (ρ= .13, SDρ= .17, 95% CI [.11, .16]). More importantly, the effect size differs significantly across several theoretical (e.g., training dimensions, type of human capital, outcome dimensions, and timing of measurement) and contextual (e.g., industry knowledge intensity, firm age, and region) moderators. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.</content>

    <title>Offshore Shared Services Center Usage by U.S. Big 4 Audit Engagement Teams</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Auditors frequently outsource audit work to offshore Shared Service Centers (SSCs) to reduce costs and ease the workload burdens of audit team members. However, concerns persist about whether these benefits come at the expense of audit quality. Using proprietary audit engagement‐level data, I evaluate whether greater SSC usage by Big 4 audit teams has an association with either, or both, audit quality and audit costs. I find that SSC usage is nearly universal in Big 4 audits, with the percentage of audit hours SSCs perform increasing in recent years. Consistent with the audit firm's objectives, evidence suggests that SSC usage is associated with fewer audit hours and lower audit fees. Importantly, I find no evidence that SSC usage is associated with lower audit quality. Overall, results suggest that SSCs have the intended effect of reducing audit costs without sacrificing audit quality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores implications of weak identification in common ‘long memory’ and recent ‘rough’ approaches to modeling volatility dynamics of financial assets. We unveil an asymptotic near-observational equivalence between a long memory model with weak autoregressive dynamics and a rough model with a near-unit autoregressive root. Standard methods struggle to distinguish them, and conventional asymptotics are invalid. We propose an identication-robust approach to construct condence sets that reveal the uncertainty and aid inference. Empirical studies based on realized volatility and trading volume often fail to statistically reject either model, thereby providing evidence of their potential coexistence.

    <title>The green sin: how exchange rate volatility and financial openness affect green premia</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a model with mean-variance foreign investors who exhibit a convex disutility associated to brown bond holdings. The model predicts that bond green premia should be smaller in economies with more closed financial accounts and highly volatile exchange rates. This happens because foreign intermediaries invest relatively less in such economies, and this lowers the marginal disutility of investing in polluting activities. We find strong empirical evidence in favor of this hypothesis using a global bond market dataset. Exchange rate volatility and financial account openness are thus able to explain the higher financing costs of green projects in emerging markets relative to advanced economies, especially when green bonds are denominated in local currency: a disadvantage that we can call the “green sin” of emerging economies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the adoption of Central Bank digital currency (CBDC) in a partial equilibrium setting, focusing on four key features: remuneration, monetary incentives, interoperability, and architecture. Agents are interested in adopting CBDC because they have a preference for digital payments, and the Central Bank may incentivize adoption through subsidies and platform development, potentially in collaboration with the private sector. Our results demonstrate that both the remuneration scheme and monetary incentives significantly influence the adoption rate and transaction volume. Calibrating the model for the digital euro case study, we show that the target of 60% of the population using CBDC can be achieved, provided that platform productivity is substantially enhanced. Although this target is feasible within a one-layer architecture, it becomes significantly more challenging in a two-layer setting. CBDC is likely to win the adoption battle against stablecoins but is likely to lose it against debit cards.This paper has been This paper was accepted by Will Cong for the Special Issue on Digital Finance.Funding: This project has been partially funded by the European Union – Next Generation EU – PNRR project SERICS “Security and Rights in the CyberSpace” (PE00000014 – CUP B53C22003990006) – SPOKE 9.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01504 .</content>

    <title>Intentionality and Attentionality Dynamics in an Institutional Change Process</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article, we explore how actors' intentionality emerges, develops, and co‐evolves with institutional change. Although intentions are essential in shaping institutional change agents' motivations and actions, our understanding of their dynamics is limited and biased by the assumption that intentions are usually identifiable prior to institutional change. Building on the works of philosophers, in particular Husserl's life exploration of consciousness and intentions, we argue that a more effective way to conceptualize intentionality in institutional change is to consider attentionality, that is, how actors direct their mental focus toward specific elements of their social reality. Empirically, we draw upon a phenomenon‐driven study of the Algerian agricultural transformation from 2000 to 2019, with a focus on the contributions of Benamor, a leading agri‐food business. We theorize a process model that differentiates between passive and active intentions. Passive intentions are virtual mental possibilities upon which active intentions are built to instigate change. Our findings highlight attentional conversion as a crucial mechanism that drives the transition from passive to active intentions. These findings have important implications for our understanding of institutional change theories.</content>

    <title>Most Read Versus Most Shared: How Less (vs. More) Social Popularity Labels Influence News Media Consumption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;News outlets commonly highlight the most popular content using different labels (e.g., “most read” and “most shared”). As prior research has found that people primarily consume news for information or entertainment, it is important to understand what these popularity labels convey about the information value and entertainment value of articles and how they shape consumers’ news preferences and decisions. Nine lab and field studies, including two in the web appendix, demonstrate that labels reflecting less social behavior (e.g., “most read”) signal higher information (vs. entertainment) value, while labels reflecting more social behavior (e.g., “most shared”) signal higher entertainment (vs. information) value. Thus, consumers with information motives prefer less social popularity labels, a stronger signal of information value. Conversely, consumers with entertainment motives prefer more social labels, a stronger signal of entertainment value. Notably, an analysis of 120 major media outlets revealed that many use labels that are misaligned with readers’ dominant motives or use no label at all, indicating considerable room for improvement. Reassuringly, this work finds that strategically using popularity labels can increase clicks by over 20%. This has implications for media outlets aiming to spur engagement as well as researchers and organizations concerned with information dissemination.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In light of recent social and political movements advocating for racial equity and calls for more research on interracial marketplace interactions, this research explores the role racial identity plays in the consumption domain. Specifically, we investigate the marketplace consequences of U.S.-based White consumers’ feelings about their own racial identity by measuring and manipulating white guilt, defined as the sense of guilt and remorse that emerges among White consumers who hold their racial ingroup responsible for historical and ongoing racial injustices and perceive that Whites, as a racial group, benefit from unearned privileges. Consistent with the reparation-oriented action profile of guilt, six studies (all pre-registered, two with incentive-compatible designs) show that white guilt motivates reparative behaviors toward Black-owned businesses in various service contexts: Consumers with high white guilt express greater willingness to patronize and promote a business when it is Black-owned (vs. White-owned, family-owned, or when there is no information on ownership) and feel more moral for doing so, whereas this effect is non-existent, or sometimes reversed, for those low in white guilt. Our findings reveal the complex dynamics of race, identity, and intergroup relations in the marketplace, and demonstrate a contemporary exception to ingroup favoritism among some White consumers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Shuang Ma, Lin Ge, Michael Jia, Yonggui WangIn recent years, the use of service robots in the lodging, dining, and retail sectors has become more prevalent. Service robots offer various benefits, such as reducing operational costs, improving service efficiency, enabling 24-hour support, and ensuring consistent service quality. However, our research indicates that service firms do not uniformly benefit from service robot deployment across all service settings. Specifically, we show that customers’ relative preference for service robots over human service providers is lower in luxury services than in mainstream services. We call it the robot disadvantage in luxury services. This disadvantage arises because service robots—as nonhuman service providers—cannot make customers feel that they are being served as a prestigious customer of superior social status over service providers. To address this challenge, we propose two effective strategies for luxury service firms. First, luxury service firms may emphasize the concept of social equality in their communications. Second, luxury service firms may frame the use of service robots as an exclusive privilege. Both approaches can mitigate customers’ resistance to robots in luxury services.</content>

    <title>How to Sample and When to Stop Sampling: The Generalized Wald Problem and Minimax Policies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study sequential experiments where sampling is costly and a decision-maker aims to determine the best treatment for full scale implementation by (1) adaptively allocating units between two possible treatments, and (2) stopping the experiment when the expected welfare (inclusive of sampling costs) from implementing the chosen treatment is maximized. Working under a continuous time limit, we characterize the optimal policies under the minimax regret criterion. We show that the same policies also remain optimal under both parametric and non-parametric outcome distributions in an asymptotic regime where sampling costs approach zero. The minimax optimal sampling rule is just the Neyman allocation: it is independent of sampling costs and does not adapt to observed outcomes. The decision-maker halts sampling when the product of the average treatment difference and the number of observations surpasses a specific threshold. The results derived also apply to the so-called best-arm identification problem, where the number of observations is exogenously specified.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide evidence for a causal link between the US economy and the global financial cycle. Using intraday data, we show that US macroeconomic news releases have large and significant effects on global risky asset prices. Stock price indexes of 27 countries, the VIX, and commodity prices all jump instantaneously upon news releases. The responses of stock indexes co-move across countries and are large—often comparable in size to the response of the S&amp;P 500. Further, US macroeconomic news explains on average 23 percent of the quarterly variation in foreign stock markets. The joint behavior of stock prices, bond yields, and risk premia suggests that systematic US monetary policy reactions to news do not drive the estimated effects. Instead, the evidence points to a direct effect on investors’ risk-taking capacity. Our findings show that a byproduct of the United States’ central position in the global financial system is that news about its business cycle has large effects on global financial conditions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a descriptive analysis of performance of disciplines, journals, authors, and universities based on number of publications in fifty business and economics journals represented in the Financial Times list (FT 50) from 2008-2022 using data from the Web of Science. We analyze more than 55,000 papers published by more than 54,000 unique authors during this period to document four sets of findings. First, our analysis suggests that Operations Management and Multidisciplinary areas experienced significant publication growth from 2008 to 2022, increasing their publication and citation share in FT 50 journals, even after accounting for the relative handicap in terms of number of journals in the FT 50 list. Second, the growth in publications of the Operations Management discipline is driven by significant growth inProduction and Operations ManagementandManufacturing and Service Operations Management. Notably, theJournal of Business Ethicsalone published nearly 10% of the papers published in the FT 50 list, more than the number of papers published by the five disciplines each: Accounting, Marketing, Multidisciplinary, Operations Management, and Information Systems. Third, we find that the most prolific authors in Management and Organizations, Operations Management, Economics, and Marketing had a higher number of publications during the 2008-2022 period than the most prolific authors of other disciplines. Finally, our analyses of the most prolific 150 worldwide universities published in the FT 50 list suggest that the list is dominated mostly by about a dozen countries that include North American countries (USA and Canada), European countries (Netherlands, Germany, UK, France, and Spain), China (including Hong Kong), Australia, and Singapore. We discuss the implications of our findings for ranking organizations, editors, academic associations, individual scientists, administrators, and policymakers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Self-driving Technology and Its Acceptance: Explaining Differences in Reactions of the Heterogeneous Population to Potential Policies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Self-driving cars have the potential to drastically reduce accidents caused by human errors, saving significant amounts of money in damages as well as human lives. However, public acceptance of the technology operating on public roads still needs to improve, as most Americans are uncomfortable sharing the road with a self-driving car. The challenge for policymakers is to craft regulations that not only enhance the safety of self-driving technology but also foster public trust and acceptance. This study examines how specific policies—requiring visual cues to indicate when a vehicle is operating in self-driving mode and certification requirements for users—impact public acceptance of self-driving cars. To evaluate the impact of the policies, we theorize how policies may influence people’s trust and how trust, in turn, may affect acceptance of technology. Furthermore, we examine how these effects vary across political affiliations, as prior research suggests that Republicans and Democrats differ in their trust in government oversight and technological innovation. Our findings confirm that Republicans are generally less willing to share the road with self-driving vehicles than Democrats, largely due to lower trust in the government to regulate the technology effectively. We find that a visual cue policy increases trust in government but decreases trust in the technology, leading to increased acceptance among Republicans but a neutral or negative effect for Democrats. Conversely, a certification requirement increases trust in government and in other drivers, positively impacting acceptance for both Republicans and Democrats. Finally, additional analysis revealed that a combined policy implementing both measures proves to be the most effective at increasing overall public acceptance by strengthening trust across multiple dimensions. These insights provide valuable guidance for policymakers seeking to improve the integration of self-driving cars into public roadways.</content>

    <title>The Art of Misspelling: Unraveling the Diverging Effects of Misspelled Brand Names on Consumer Responses</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Linguistic characteristics influence how consumers recognize and associate with brands. Although recent research shows the negative impact of misspellings in brand names on sincerity and brand attitudes, many brands successfully use this strategy to create unique brand identities. We argue that not all misspellings have the same negative impact and thus explore how consumers process brand names through both linguistic and conceptual fluency. In a series of six experiments, we present and examine a typology of misspellings and their differential impact on fluency and resulting consumer attitudes, inferences, and behavioral intentions. This typology of brand name misspellings provides a practical framework guiding brand naming strategy. We demonstrate that minor misspellings can be just as effective as correct spellings. More severe misspellings can also be effective if consumers perceive them as relevant. The findings reveal how managers can reap the benefits of misspelling, such as memorability, uniqueness, or trademark acquisition, and avoid the overall negative effects.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms strive to improve their products over time to compete effectively in the market. Typically, firms enhance products to stay competitive by adding novel features, imitating competitors, or leveraging customer input through social media. In the case of mobile apps, user feedback in the form of reviews includes suggestions of novel features or features that are already present in competing apps. Leveraging the information contained in reviews and version release notes of iOS apps, we develop a deep learning–based natural language processing approach to identify four types of app features: developer-initiated novel, developer-initiated imitative, user-suggested novel, and user-suggested imitative. We evaluate the impact of these feature categories on app demand. We observe that developer-initiated novel and user-suggested imitative features significantly boost app demand. Conversely, user-suggested novel features can negatively impact demand, especially when they are implemented contextually distant from user suggestions, though contextually close implementations have a positive effect. Although we observe that the aggregate impact of developer-initiated imitative features is insignificant, features that are slightly modified do have a positive effect on demand. The primary contribution of our study is to investigate user reviews as a source of ideas for new features and to evaluate their performance impacts relative to those of developer-initiated features.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managing an older and more age‐diverse workforce is critical given the population aging that is occurring across the globe. Yet, the literature is still under‐developed with regards to which human resource management (HRM) practices help to support aging employees and enable organizations to benefit from an age‐diverse workforce. We draw on an integrative framework of organizational meta‐strategies, the 3i framework, to test a path model in which 3i HRM practices differentially impact successful aging at work outcomes, including engagement, career withdrawal, and proactive career behavior. The 3i framework encompassesinclusivepractices aimed at reducing biases and creating an inclusive climate for workers,individualizedpractices aimed at designing and adapting work to the changing needs of an age‐diverse workforce, andintegrativepractices targeted at effective collaboration and knowledge sharing processes across age groups. We theorized thatincludeinfluences successful aging outcomes through belongingness,individualizethrough needs‐supplies fit, andintegratethrough promotive voice. Prior to testing the model, we first report a study in which we developed and validated the 12‐item 3i‐HRM scale using three diverse samples (totalN= 945) of employees from the USA and Australia. We subsequently used the 3i‐HRM scale to test our theoretical model using a time‐lagged design with 221 employees. By providing this initial evidence, we hope to stimulate future research focusing on an integrative approach to understanding factors that support an age‐diverse workforce.</content>

    <title>Intra‐firm work experiences and corporate venturing by employees: The roles of job specialization and functionally diverse groups</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Taking a strategic human capital perspective on corporate venturing by employees, we consider the potential influence of their job and group experiences within the firm. Because building new ventures requires diverse functional knowledge, greater job specialization could create a barrier to undertaking corporate venturing. However, working in more functionally diverse groups within the firm can facilitate venturing—especially for more specialized employees—by enabling them to develop the skills needed to work with others who have such diverse knowledge. We test our hypotheses using a longitudinal dataset from over 16,000 employees in a large corporation. Our findings advance understanding of the micro‐foundations of internal corporate venturing, how bureaucracies shape corporate entrepreneurship, and how employees can build knowledge and skills with strategic value for the firm.Managerial SummaryWe examine how firms can prepare their employees to undertake corporate venture building activities by shaping their work experiences inside the firm. In a study of employees' work histories within a large corporation, we find that employees who had worked in more functionally diverse groups were more likely to undertake internal corporate venturing. Such experience was particularly important for those who had worked in more specialized jobs, since it could help them collaborate and connect with others with diverse functional knowledge. Our findings suggest that firms hoping to promote strategic growth and increase their competitiveness through corporate venture building consider providing employees with work experiences that help them develop cross‐functional knowledge and skills.</content>

    <title>Founder regulatory focus: Effects on entrepreneurial orientation and venture performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article draws upon regulatory focus theory to examine the ways in which founders influence entrepreneurial orientation and performance in young ventures. Findings from studies of young ventures in Ghana (N= 226) and Kenya (N= 205) suggest that founder promotion focus has a positive effect on entrepreneurial orientation, while founder prevention focus has a negative effect. Furthermore, we find that entrepreneurial orientation mediates the effects of founder regulatory focus on young venture performance and that the strategic decision speed of founders moderates the entrepreneurial orientation—venture performance relationship. The results extend theory on entrepreneurial orientation and regulatory focus by elucidating the role of founders' characteristics in setting an entrepreneurial tone for their firms and enhancing the effects of entrepreneurial orientation on venture performance.Managerial SummaryWith this article, we highlight the roles of regulatory focus and decision speed with entrepreneurial orientation (EO) to suggest the founder is vital in setting an entrepreneurial tone in their organizations. Leaders in young ventures should realize that their dispositions have outsized influence in both the development of EO and how EO is put into action. Founders who recognize the merits of cultivating a promotion‐focused orientation can strategically leverage this orientation to fuel their ventures' EO. Conversely, the negative influence of founder prevention focus on EO signifies the potential challenges associated with risk aversion and loss avoidance in entrepreneurial ventures. Finally, leaders who acknowledge the significance of quick, informed decisions are better positioned to leverage the positive impact of EO on new venture performance.</content>

    <title>Mapping entrepreneurial inclusion across &lt;scp&gt;US&lt;/scp&gt; neighborhoods: The case of low‐code e‐commerce entrepreneurship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurship is presented as a path to prosper through commerce, yet there is evidence that certain communities are underrepresented in entrepreneurship. Technological developments such as low‐code e‐commerce tools have altered the barriers to launch commercial ventures. Do these tools alter entrepreneurial inclusion? We study an omnipresent low‐code tool, Shopify, which has dramatically reduced the financial and technical barriers to e‐commerce. We undertake an abductive analysis using unique data on the spatial distribution of Shopify‐based activity for the entire United States. We find evidence of entrepreneurial inclusion; neighborhoods with more Black residents, a group historically underrepresented in entrepreneurship, also have more low‐code ventures. We interpret these results against traditional forms of startups: newly registered businesses and VC‐backed e‐commerce ventures. These benchmark analyses further support our findings.Managerial SummaryWe consider the impact of recent technological changes that make it easier to start entrepreneurial ventures. We study the spatial uptake of a popular low‐code e‐commerce tool, Shopify, that makes launching and running an online business markedly cheaper and easier. Using data on nearly 160,000 Shopify‐based ventures across the entire United States, we find that usage of Shopify is more prevalent in neighborhoods with more Black residents. The pattern is distinct from that observed for traditional ventures and VC‐backed start‐ups. The evidence suggests low‐code tools represent a novel path to entrepreneurship, enhancing entrepreneurial access and potentially opening previously under‐explored markets. The finding further highlights the role of new tools (e.g., low‐code or AI‐driven) as a possible addition to policies aimed at enhancing entrepreneurial inclusion.</content>

    <title>The News in Earnings Announcement Disclosures: Capturing Word Context Using LLM Methods</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the information content of textual disclosures in firms’ earnings announcements. Using a large language model (LLM) to capture information in both words and word context, I show that the news in earnings press releases (i) explains three times more variation in short-window stock returns than a host of textual measures based on dictionary and non-LLM machine learning methods; (ii) doubles the R2of an array of financial statement surprises, modeled with conventional regression or machine learning approaches; and (iii) accounts for a large fraction of immediate price revisions within just five minutes of release. LLM-modeled conference calls further enhance R2by one fourth compared with press releases and financial surprises. Textual disclosures are more informative when earnings are less persistent and during periods of aggregate uncertainty. Most news arises from text describing numbers, at the beginning of the disclosure, and including novel contents. These findings highlight the role of firms’ textual disclosures in moving stock prices and advance our understanding of how investors utilize corporate disclosures.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: The author gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Naveen Jindal School of Management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05417 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When home prices threaten to decline, large mortgage investors can benefit from fostering new lending that boosts demand. We ask whether this benefit contributed to the growth in acquisitions of risky mortgages by the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) in the first half of 2007. We find that it helps explain the variation of this growth across regions, as well as regional house price and credit changes. The growth predicted by this benefit is on top of the acquisition growth caused by the exit of private-label securitizers. We conclude that the GSEs actively targeted their acquisitions to counter home-price declines.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05912 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Platform-run marketplaces may exploit third-party sellers’ data to develop competing products, but the threat of future competition can deter sellers’ entry. We explore how this trade-off affects the platform’s entry on the marketplace and the referral fee it charges to the third-party sellers. We first characterize the platform’s optimal fee under different degrees of commitment on its own entry policy. We show that full commitment maximizes not only the platform’s payoff but also consumer surplus, as the associated fee induces maximal entry by the sellers. Next, we show how and when the platform’s policy on information sharing between its marketplace and product divisions can substitute for its commitment to entry. We characterize the platform’s optimal information policy and examine how it interacts with the platform’s fee structure. We show that an outright ban on information sharing between the platform’s divisions can reduce consumer welfare as it may lead to a higher referral fee that thwarts sellers’ entry. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the platform’s fee structure as a strategic response in the policy debates on marketplace regulation.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stroke is a highly time‐sensitive medical emergency, and earlier treatment is crucial. Drawing on Temporal Motivation Theory, we investigate a “deadline effect” in stroke care and analyze how two deadlines, that is, amedically orientedone (administering Tissue Plasminogen Activator, TPA, within 4.5 h of symptom onset) and agoal‐orientedone (the 60‐min in‐hospital target fromTarget:Stroke), shape care consistency. We define a deadline effect as a variable task processing rate under time pressure from a pending task completion deadline, which can cause inconsistent care. Clinicians may work more slowly when patients arrive soon after symptom onset, given ample time remains before the 4.5‐h TPA window. Using an accelerated‐failure‐time model and addressing patient selection bias, we find that shorter onset‐to‐door times correlate with longer door‐to‐needle times, and vice versa, confirming the medically oriented deadline effect. As a result, care time may vary considerably based on how much of the TPA window remains. UnderTarget:Stroke, a goal‐driven national initiative in the United States to improve stroke care quality, stroke teams face an additional 60‐min in‐hospital deadline. Our findings show that the initiative prompts stroke teams to prioritize the tighter goal and maintain a more consistent care pace, regardless of patients' arrival times. Our mechanism analyses reveal two boundary conditions for the main findings: (i) when the downstream time segment ends with a mid‐point patient care milestone rather than the strict TPA administration deadline or (ii) when the system congestion level is high, the main findings do not hold, advancing the deadline effect literature from an operational standpoint. Furthermore, our major findings are robust to other confounding factors and model assumptions, ruling out alternative explanations. Notably, post hoc analyses confirm thatTarget:Strokefosters consistent time performance without adversely affecting other health outcomes, advocating its efficacy. In sum, we highlight the operational implications of multiple deadlines in stroke care, extending the broader deadline effect literature. For hospital clinicians, properly set goals can stabilize care processes and strengthen overall performance, emphasizing the strategic value of well‐designed deadlines in time‐critical healthcare settings.</content>

    <title>Valuation and Long-Term Growth Expectations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Long-term growth expectations are central to investment analysis and corporate valuation. Despite a dominant effect on firm value, the academic literature and practitioner conventions provide little guidance on determining this long-term growth rate. This article takes a step in addressing this gap: we estimate the relationship between long-term growth and an extensive selection of firm, industry, and market characteristics. Market prices do not seem to fully capture long-term growth information. Cross sectional tests yield substantial positive abnormal returns for firms with high expected long-term growth.</content>

    <title>The Valuation of Corporate Coupon Bonds</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article proposes and estimates a tractable, arbitrage-free valuation model for corporate coupon bonds that includes a more realistic recovery rate process. Most existing studies use a recovery rate process that is misspecified because it includes recovery for coupons due after default. Misspecification errors from assuming recovery on all coupons can be substantial; they increase with recovery rates, coupons, maturity, and default probabilities. For a large sample of market transactions, i) our model has lower pricing errors than one assuming recovery on all coupons and ii) the magnitude of our model’s outperformance is linked to misspecification errors from assuming recovery on coupons.</content>

    <title>The Lender’s Lender: Trade Credit and the Monitoring Role of Banks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A firm’s role as lender to its customers (via trade credit) is influenced by the firm’s own lenders. With a novel data set of trade credit between U.S. public companies, I find that firms limit customer credit concentrations, extending less generous trade credit to customers as the firms’ sales dependence on them increases. Evidence points to lenders influencing firms to limit credit concentrations: First, cross-sectional variation shows stronger results with greater lender monitoring intensity. Second, analysis of granular loan contract details reveals that concentration limits in borrowing base formulas are a clear, previously unexplored way banks influence trade credit policies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Poison pills are among the most powerful antitakeover provisions, but studying their economic impact is challenging because of the obvious endogeneity concerns. We address the problem by studying U.S. states’ staggered adoption of poison pill laws (PPLs), which strengthen the right to adopt a pill (i.e., theshadow pill) and increase the validity of visible pills. We document that PPLs make visible pill policy aligned with economic incentives, increasing pill adoption among firms with a high likelihood of takeover, but decreasing it among firms with low takeover likelihood. We also document that PPLs positively impact firm value, especially for innovative firms with more intangible assets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the impact of limited attention on investment decisions by venture capitalists (VCs). I find that startups funded by VCs during VCs’ IPO engagements tend to underperform: These startups are 9% less likely to go public or become acquired and have lower exit multiples. The effects of VCs’ busyness cluster around the active phase of the IPO engagement and are more pronounced in cases of higher workload intensity or higher information asymmetry. Overall, this performance gap induced by attention constraints provides new evidence on VCs’ ability to identify investment opportunities at the initial screening stage.</content>

    <title>Visible Hands: Professional Asset Managers’ Expectations and the Stock Market in China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how professional fund managers’ growth expectations affect their equity investments and the consequent effects on prices. Using novel data on China’s mutual fund managers’ growth expectations, we show that pessimistic managers decrease equity allocations and shift away from more cyclical stocks. We identify a statistically significant link between managers’ growth expectations and returns on the stocks that they hold and trade. We also find that an earnings-based measure of price informativeness is increasing in forecasting managers’ investment and forecast-consistent trading, implying that active fund managers in China help move stock prices closer to underlying fundamentals.</content>

    <title>The Cost of Equity: Evidence from Investment Banking Valuations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using manually compiled cost of equity (COE) estimates disclosed in takeover regulatory filings, we provide novel evidence on how investment bankers estimate discount rates. COE estimates are related to several risk proxies, such as beta and size. Other firm characteristics are unrelated to COE estimates or provide relations contradicting academic evidence. We also explore the role of incentives. For example, banks use significantly higher COEs in management buyouts, which potentially underestimates target value, making the bid more attractive for target shareholder approval.</content>

    <title>Better Tax Enforcement Moderates Airbnb’s Pressure on Housing Costs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The growing popularity of home-sharing platforms such as Airbnb, partly fueled by hosts’ ability to evade local taxes and regulations, has been shown to elevate housing costs by reallocating long-term housing units to the short-term rental market. This study assesses whether enhanced tax enforcement can mitigate this trend. We analyze staggered tax collection agreements between Airbnb and Florida counties, wherein Airbnb collects taxes from the hosts directly. Using a difference-in-differences methodology, we find these agreements significantly slow the growth of housing costs, highlighting the importance of tax policy in addressing the sharing economy’s influence on housing affordability.</content>

    <title>The Crowding-In Effect of Public Information on Private Information Acquisition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The dissemination of public information regarding an asset’s fundamental value can encourage the acquisition of private information by informed traders, leading to a crowding-in effect. Competing with the crowding-out effect analyzed in prior research, the crowding-in effect shapes the demand for private information in a hump-shaped curve against public information quality. I examine how a for-profit information seller strategically provides information, exploiting this hump-shaped demand curve, and offer theoretical support for the coexistence of free and paid information. The model yields distinctive insights into the equilibrium information structure and market quality when the crowding-in effect drives public information dissemination.</content>

    <title>Auctions versus Negotiations: The Role of the Payment Structure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate a seller's strategic choice between optimally structured negotiations with fewer bidders and an auction with more competing bidders when payments can have a contingent component, as is common in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), patent licensing, and employee compensation. The key factor favoring negotiations is that it allows the seller to set her preferred payment structure—that is, the revenue‐maximizing mix of cash and contingent pay; reserve prices are of secondary importance. Negotiations are more likely to dominate if synergies increase in bidders' productivity types (as with acquirer‐target complementarities in M&amp;A). Higher dispersion and magnitude of bidders' private valuations also favor negotiations.</content>

    <title>Digital Affective Encounters: The Relational Role of Content Circulation on Social Media</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One of the most ubiquitous practices on social media is sharing content with others to show affection or affirm an interpersonal connection. Extant consumer research has examined the circulation of objects fueled by desire or as repositories and carriers of emotion and value. The paper extends this work to understand how consumer relationships are shaped through the creation, consumption, and circulation of digital objects imbued with affect. Drawing upon interviews with both managers and followers of animal accounts and netnographic data of animal content on Instagram, this work theorizes how digital affective encounters on social media transpire through the circulation of animal content. The findings highlight the processes through which content is continuously imbued with affective cues to manage parasocial and interpersonal relationships. While affect-laden content can serve as a relational token when shared between friends and family, it can also be captured and modified by large accounts. As a result, the affective force of this content can reach mass audiences and become memetic. Our paper shows the significant role of affect as a mobilizing force of digital affective networks. Beyond animal content, the framework is transferable to the circulation of other social media content and consumer-influencer relationships.</content>

    <title>Strategic Best-Response Fairness Framework for Fair Machine Learning</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study introduces a framework called “strategic best-response fairness” (SBR-fairness) to address discrimination perpetuated by machine-learning (ML) algorithms. It challenges the conventional focus on fairness solely in prediction results, arguing that this approach ignores how individuals affected by the predictions may alter their behavior in response to algorithmic decisions. The framework considers whether an algorithm, trained on potentially biased data, leads to identical equilibrium behaviors across different subpopulations that are ex ante identical. The study finds that common fair-ML algorithms, such as those relying on color-blindness and demographic parity fairness criteria, do not always achieve SBR fairness. This means that they may not eliminate disparities in effort and outcomes. Equalized odds (EO), however, have been shown to achieve SBR fairness, but they suffer from several practical limitations. The study proposes that SBR fairness is a necessary condition for breaking cycles of discrimination in ML. It also argues that SBR fairness offers a complementary way to assess other fairness criteria and understand behavioral responses. The findings suggest a need for policy and practical focus on designing SBR-fair algorithms that promote equitable outcomes at both the prediction and behavioral level.</content>
