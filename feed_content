    <title>Differential Privacy via Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Privacy-Accuracy Trade-off from an Optimization Lens: Fix a Desired Level of Privacy, Then Maximize AccuracyIn differential privacy, the de facto standard for safeguarding individual information in data analysis, noise is added to statistics to limit the disclosure of sensitive information. Greater privacy requires more noise, creating a trade-off as the added noise reduces the accuracy of the resulting statistics. Historically, researchers have addressed this by restricting themselves to families of noise mechanisms that are sufficient for a predefined privacy level and proving their performance under specific conditions. Selvi, Liu, and Wiesemann propose a novel approach that guarantees optimal accuracy for any specified privacy level. They formulate the design of privacy mechanisms as an optimization problem that minimizes the expected loss associated with the random noise mechanism while encoding differential privacy as constraints. Through detailed analyses and by leveraging tools from distributionally robust optimization, they develop an efficient optimization algorithm and derive implementable solutions with provable guarantees to solve the problem within seconds.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this study, we leverage the transformation of a performance management system that shifts from only providing a performance rating to also providing an explicit assessment of potential. Although performance measures enable organizations to evaluate an employee’s past performance, they provide limited information regarding the employee’s potential to perform in a prospective job that requires a different skill set. Consequently, firms are gradually moving toward the incorporation of explicit potential assessments in their annual appraisal process to evaluate the employee’s promotability to a different task environment. Our data access allows us to provide evidence on the consequences of implementing a performance management system that adopted the explicit assessment of potential. We find that, on average, the performance of promoted employees is lower after implementation, suggesting that the potential assessment system is less effective in identifying candidates suitable for promotion. Additional analyses lead us to conclude that the difficulty of evaluating employee potential reduces performance upon promotion because of inaccurate recommendations of supervisors who do not sufficiently differentiate in their ratings. We thus identify variation in supervisors’ evaluation quality as an important source of the Peter Principle.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02199 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digitalization and global disruptions have fundamentally changed how we approach work. Global virtual work has become increasingly widespread in recent years, often replacing or complementing traditional expatriation and international business travel. To advance our understanding of this phenomenon, we systematically reviewed the literature on global virtual work, distinguishing it into three domains: global virtual teams, distributed work, and the use of digital technologies. For each domain, we examined key actors, their objectives, underlying theories, methodologies, and findings. The first domain provides insights into the antecedents, moderators, and mediators of the effectiveness of global virtual teams. The second domain explores individual and organizational research on diverse distributed work arrangements, such as offshoring, global platforms, and global nomads. The third domain addresses the enabling and moderating roles that digital technologies play in facilitating global virtual work. Synthesizing prior research, we developed a multilevel conceptual framework that integrates inputs, processes, and outcomes of global virtual work, offering novel perspectives. We outlined promising opportunities for future research across four themes: people, technology, context, and time. Additionally, we examined the practical implications of our findings for policymakers, managers, and individual workers as they navigate the evolving landscape of global virtual work.</content>

    <title>Artificial Intelligence (AI) Assistant in Online Shopping: A Randomized Field Experiment on a Livestream Selling Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Livestream selling is an innovative form of online shopping that supports real-time interactions between streamers and consumers. However, a key challenge remains: Streamers have limited capacity to answer individual inquiries, whereas shoppers expect fast, personalized responses. This study investigates whether an AI-powered streaming assistant can address this tension by providing interactive, chat-based support to help consumers access and process information. Through a large-scale randomized field experiment on a leading livestream selling platform, we find that the AI assistant increases sales by 3.00% and reduces product return rates by 12.55%. Our analysis suggests that the AI assistant helps consumers feel more informed and confident in their purchases, thereby reducing uncertainty. At the same time, the AI assistant can occasionally disrupt the consumers’ livestream experience. Overall, the benefits of uncertainty reduction outweigh the negative influence of interruptions. For platform managers and policymakers, these findings evidence the potential of AI technology to enhance online commerce. The AI assistant is particularly effective for high-uncertainty products and for streamers with large audiences, offering implications for strategic deployment. Our research provides actionable insights for integrating AI into livestream selling and other digital commerce scenarios where real-time, AI-powered support can facilitate both consumer satisfaction and business growth.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Regulators have increasingly mandated firms to promptly disclose material cybersecurity incidents upon discovering these incidents. We find suggestive evidence indicating that some firms manipulate the discovery date (“misreport”) of a cybersecurity incident to postpone the disclosure of the incident, as evidenced by a pronounced spike in insider sales before the reported discovery date. We also find that misreporting is more prevalent among firms with weak internal control systems, when firms face low litigation risk, and when firms have greater pressure to meet a disclosure deadline. Further, firms suspected of misreporting tend to disclose their remedial actions and assert the restoration of business, mitigating negative market reactions upon disclosure of incidents. Collectively, our results suggest that firms might strategically misreport information about a cybersecurity incident to delay disclosure to gain additional time for remedial actions, which helps them prevent exposing vulnerabilities to malicious actors and alleviate stakeholder anxiety.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01058 .</content>

    <title>Position Auctions with Endogenous Product Information: Why Live-Streaming Advertising Is Thriving</title>
    <updated>2025-03-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Live-streaming advertising in e-commerce is soaring. Both Amazon and Alibaba have employed this novel marketing model to engage consumers by sequentially exhibiting different products through live-streaming videos. In this paper, we adopt a mechanism design framework to model live-streaming e-commerce as a position auction with endogenous provision of product information. We prove that finding the mechanism that simultaneously optimizes position allocation and information provision is NP-hard. Thus, we develop several approximation algorithms. Building on the connection to the order selection problem, our analysis establishes that heuristics relying solely on product information provision can achieve up to 66.9% of the optimal revenue in the worst case. In contrast, heuristics exploiting position allocation alone may result in arbitrarily large revenue losses. We attribute the efficacy of product information provision to its enhancement of the value of ad spots in position auctions. Our findings suggest that advertising that focuses on differentiating product information—as in live-streaming e-commerce—is more lucrative than conventional position-based sponsored search. This managerial insight remains valid when accommodating multiproduct purchases with dependency or accounting for random consumer attention spans.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72201234, 72192805], the Hong Kong Research Grants Council [Grants 16211619, 16502219, 16212821, 16501722, C6032-21G], and the Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Mathematical Foundations for Artificial Intelligence [Grant 2023B1212010001].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.01299 .</content>

    <title>Do Managers Successfully Shop for Auditors Who Allow Them to Opportunistically Report Positive News? Evidence from Accounting Estimates</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior auditor shopping literature examines managers’ attempts to opportunistically underreport negative news by finding auditors who will allow them to avoid negative audit opinions or underreport goodwill impairments or financial misstatements. We advance this literature by examining management attempts to opportunistically report positive news, as captured by income-increasing changes in accounting estimates. Adapting a previous framework, we find that, ex ante, managers are more (less) likely to dismiss their auditor if it increases (decreases) the expected likelihood of reporting income-increasing changes in accounting estimates (POSCHGs). We also find that, ex post, following auditor dismissals, the frequency and magnitude of POSCHGs increase, and companies reporting POSCHGs are more likely to restate earnings, receive Securities and Exchange Commission comment letters related to estimates, meet or beat earnings targets, and less likely to receive going concern opinions or violate debt covenants. Placebo tests show that none of the above results hold for income-decreasing changes in estimates. Finally, we identify several institutional factors that constrain managers’ ability to shop for lenient auditors, including the quality of the successor auditor and strong corporate governance. Collectively, our findings are consistent with managers successfully shopping for auditors who allow them to opportunistically report positive news following auditor dismissals.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05299 .</content>

    <title>Towards the Integration of Precision Medicine in Psychiatric Care Delivery: Evaluating the Impact of Clinical Guidelines on Drug‐Related Adverse Events</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the immense potential of precision medicine to revolutionize healthcare, its integration into routine clinical practice remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the impact of Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines, which provide synthesized evidence and pharmacogenetics‐based drug dosing recommendations, on the delivery of psychiatric care enabled by precision medicine. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the effect of CPIC guidelines on serious drug‐related adverse events and explore how drug characteristics related to therapeutic uncertainty, namely drug age and drug label warning, moderate this effect. Our findings suggest that the availability of CPIC guidelines is associated with almost a 25% decrease in serious drug‐related adverse events in the context of psychiatric care delivery enabled by precision medicine. Furthermore, we find that the presence of drug label warning, as FDA‐endorsed negative news on pharmacogenetics‐related drug use, enhances the effect of CPIC guidelines and is associated with a further decrease in serious drug‐related adverse events. Post hoc analysis reveals that CPIC guidelines with high strength of evidence are associated with a significant decrease in serious drug‐related adverse events, while no such effect is observed for guidelines with low strength of evidence. These findings contribute to the nascent literature on integrating precision medicine into routine clinical practice, highlighting the consequential role of clinical guidelines in improving the effectiveness of psychiatric care delivery for individual patients enabled by precision medicine. In addition, by demonstrating how the development and implementation of robust clinical guidelines are central to minimizing serious drug‐related adverse events, the findings have policy implications for minimizing the downside risks of psychiatric care delivery.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a tender offer by a value increasing raider, voting shareholders face a free-rider problem. However, when they are not atomistic, they do not completely free-ride. In contrast, non-voting shareholders, who are never pivotal for the success of the offer, are absolute free-riders. Hence in this case there is a gain from departing from one share/one vote. This departure also has a cost; there is an increased vulnerability to value decreasing raiders, and the optimal governance structure balances the cost and the gain.</content>

    <title>CEO Turnover, Sequential Disclosure and Stock Returns</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that firms experience large negative stock returns during, and positive returns following, the first informational events after forced CEO turnovers. This V-shaped return pattern is driven by the strategic sequential disclosure of bad news and good news, aligned with incoming CEOs’ incentives to manage expectations. The pattern is more pronounced when these incentives are stronger, such as when firms earn higher stock returns and have higher valuation uncertainty leading up to the informational events. Evidence from firms’ earnings surprises, analysts’ forecast revisions, and large language model-based measures of disclosure behavior indicates that incoming CEOs often initially release bad news about realized and short-term earnings, projecting a broadly pessimistic outlook for the firm’s future performance, and subsequently disclose favorable news about longer-term earnings prospects. Our findings suggest that investors make the costly mistake of failing to discern the incentives behind managers’ disclosure.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using unique data on Italian households from 2011–2015, we examine how investor demand-side and bank supply-side characteristics relate to households’ holdings of bonds issued by their own bank. Households with a higher concentration of own bank bonds tend to have a lower education level, a shorter investment horizon, and less wealth. Controlling for investment and investor attributes, households exhibit high bank bond concentration when the issuing bank has high funding needs, low profitability, or a high branch market share. Furthermore, we show that a buy-and-hold strategy on bank bonds yields lower returns than one on government bonds over the same period. These findings offer insights into retail bond issuance, an important source of funding for banks in times of market stress.</content>

    <title>Voluntary Minimum Wages: The Local Labor Market Effects of National Retailer Policies</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Low unionization rates, a falling real federal minimum wage, and outsourcing have hampered wage growth in the low-wage sector in the US for several decades. In recent years (2014-2023), a number of large private retailers – including some of the largest employers in the U.S. – have opted to institute or raise company-wide, voluntary minimum wages (VMWs) for their employees. We use anonymized payroll data from a large credit bureau and a major payroll provider to study the effects of these national retailer policies on adopting employers’ own wages and employment as well as their spillovers to other employers in shared local labor markets, variously defined. Using stacked event studies centered around multiple VMW events and a continuous treatment variable defined as the gap between local area wages and the company minimum, we find that VMWs result in sizable wage increases and reductions in turnover at the companies that implemented them. Turning to wages at other companies, we estimate small, often economically negligible, spillover effects across multiple measures of exposure to VMWs and numerous definitions of relevant competitors, including firms connected by worker flows. Together, the evidence points to little role for strategic interactions in the transmission of large retailers’ wage policies to other firms. Voluntary minimum wage policies have affected over 3 million jobs at adopting employers, yet their impact on the broader labor market is limited.</content>

    <title>Unit Commitment Without Commitment: A Dynamic Programming Approach for Managing an Integrated Energy System Under Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building Flexibility into Energy System DispatchThe growing use of renewable energy is forcing power system operators to grapple with increasing uncertainty and intermittency in their energy supplies and demands. In “Unit Commitment without Commitment: A Dynamic Programming Approach for Managing an Integrated Energy System Under Uncertainty,” Brown and Smith develop a dynamic programming (DP) framework for balancing supply and demand over time. The approach introduces stochastic Lagrange multipliers as surrogate energy prices, which reduces the system-wide DP to a collection of unit-specific DPs, where each unit is managed to maximize its expected profit over a long time horizon, given these uncertain prices. Real-time dispatch decisions are then made using the unit-specific value functions to capture the longer-term impacts of the dispatch decisions. Using data from the Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress systems, this new approach reduced operational costs by 2% in current systems and 4%–5% in example future scenarios with increased solar and storage capabilities. Strikingly, the proposed methods performed within 0.2%–0.3% of plans based on perfect foresight, across a wide variety of scenarios.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a statistical framework of using artificial intelligence to improve human decision making. The performance of each human decision maker is benchmarked against that of machine predictions. We replace the diagnoses made by a subset of the decision makers with the recommendation from the machine learning algorithm. We apply both a heuristic frequentist approach and a Bayesian posterior loss function approach to abnormal birth detection using a nationwide data set of doctor diagnoses from prepregnancy checkups of reproductive-age couples and pregnancy outcomes. We find that our algorithm on a test data set results in a higher overall true positive rate and a lower false positive rate than the diagnoses made by doctors only.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: H.

    <title>Joint Placement, Delivery Promise, and Fulfillment in Online Retail</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider the placement, delivery promise, and fulfillment decisions of an online retailer. We have a set of products with given numbers of units to be placed at capacitated fulfillment centers. Once we make the placement decisions, we face demands for the products arriving from different demand regions randomly over time. In response to each demand, we pick a delivery promise to offer, which determines the probability that the demand converts into sales as well as choose a fulfillment center to use to serve the demand. Our goal is to decide where to place the units at the beginning of the selling horizon and to find a policy to make delivery promise and fulfillment decisions over the selling horizon so that we maximize the total expected profit. We give an approximation strategy to obtain solutions with performance guarantees for this joint placement, delivery promise, and fulfillment problem. In our approximation strategy, we construct a bounding function that upper bounds the total expected profit from the delivery promise and fulfillment policy when viewed as a function of the placement decisions. To make the placement decisions, we maximize the bounding function subject to the capacity constraints at the fulfillment centers. To make the delivery promise and fulfillment decisions, we construct a policy that obtains a constant fraction of the bounding function. Using our approximation strategy with appropriate bounding functions, we obtain a solution with a constant factor performance guarantee, but if the size of the system, measured by the numbers of units that we need to place and capacities of the fulfillment centers, is large, then we get an asymptotically optimal solution. We compare our approximation strategy with approaches that ignore the interactions between the placement, delivery promise, and fulfillment decisions as well as heuristics that are based on Lagrangian relaxation, demonstrating that our approximation strategy compares quite favorably.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: The work of the first and third authors was partly supported by the National Science Foundation Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation [Grant CMMI-2226900].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a dynamic evolutionary model of innovation culture and its organizational effects at three levels. At the frontline level, informal bottom-up innovation ideas are driven by unplanned interactions governed by cultural norms, as frontline employees sort themselves into idea generator or implementor behaviors. Management cannot directly control innovation interactions and thus culture, but it can imperfectly nudge it by influencing a sharing norm at the second level. At the third level, the culture influences the innovation performance and productivity of the firm and is thus relevant for the organization’s competitiveness. This modeling approach disentangles how top-down strategy interacts with implicit frontline dynamics of cultural evolution, in the context of innovation. Unguided culture does not lead to maximum firm performance. Management guidance may or may not improve performance, and industry competition may select higher-performing cultures, which then spread through the industry under some circumstances. We characterize under which conditions management has a strong influence on culture and performance and under which conditions performance is driven more by forces outside of management’s control.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05087 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present evidence that loan allocations and loan terms are closely linked to the strength of social connections between bank and borrower regions. Lending increases with social connectedness, particularly in the presence of strong screening incentives. If connectedness is high, banks discriminate between borrowers more, the terms of originated loans are more borrower friendly, and loan performance is better. Furthermore, social connectedness is associated with higher bank profitability and with lending-related increases in borrower-region GDP growth and employment. Our results suggest that lending barriers decrease with social connectedness, which helps our understanding of geographic lending patterns and regional economic disparities.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present a model rationalizing the economic value of digital tokens for launching peer-to-peer platforms. By using the blockchain to transparently distribute tokens before the platform launches, a token sale overcomes later coordination failures between the platform’s users. This result follows from forward induction reasoning, under which the costly and observable action of token acquisition credibly communicates the intent to participate on the platform. Our framework demonstrates the applications of digital tokens to entrepreneurship, and offers guidance for both practitioners and regulators. (JEL C72, C73, L26, D85, G23)</content>

    <title>Beefing IT Up for Your Investor? Engagement with Open Source Communities, Innovation, and Startup Funding: Evidence from GitHub</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the engagement of nascent firms with open source communities and its implications for innovation and attracting funding. To do so, we link data on 160,065 U.S. startups from Crunchbase to their activities on the open source software development platform GitHub. In a matched sample of firms with and without GitHub activities, difference-in-differences models reveal a substantial increase in the likelihood of being funded after early stage startups engage with open source communities on GitHub. This relationship is weaker for firms that employ GitHub for internal development only. Startups developing novel technologies tend to benefit more from engaging with open source communities, unlike those in highly competitive environments. This heterogeneity highlights a potential trade-off between engaging with open source communities and appropriability. To provide insight regarding mechanisms, we classify startups’ technology use-cases on GitHub using machine learning and exploit data on product launches. Our results from these additional analyses support the notion that one important channel potentially driving our findings is the access to external knowledge for technology development provided by open source communities. Engaging with these communities may thereby aid startups in innovating and creating a (minimum) viable product.Funding: A. Conti and C.

    <title>Design- and Theory-Based Approaches to Strategic Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a unified framework to examine the implications of two primary approaches to strategic decision making under uncertainty: designing and shaping future scenarios vis-à-vis testing theories about future scenarios. We conducted a three-arm randomized controlled trial involving 308 early stage entrepreneurs, dividing them into three groups—design-based training, theory-based training, and a control group—and tracked them over approximately 1.5 years. Our findings reveal that both approaches reduce the need for information in decision making and lead to higher commitment rates. The design-based approach encourages action despite negative beliefs, resulting in less frequent and later project termination. In contrast, the theory-based approach promotes a more conservative termination rule, leading to earlier and more frequent project abandonment. Although the theory-based approach is associated with higher average performance upon survival, the design-based approach fosters breakthroughs for decision makers. In sum, the design-based approach is well-suited for innovative ventures that gather information to shape their environment, whereas the theory-based approach is optimal for pursuing high performance under lower degrees of uncertainty.Funding: The research leading to these results has received funding from the Italian Ministry for Education, “Entrepreneurs as Scientists: When and How Start-ups Benefit from a Scientific Approach to Decision Making” project [Grant PRIN 2017, Prot. 2017PM7R52, CUP J44I20000220001].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18245 .</content>

    <title>Project Networks and Reallocation Externalities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A project involves several participants—including clients, contractors, and subcontractors—that work concurrently on multiple projects and allocate resources among them. This interdependency creates a network of otherwise-unrelated projects. We map the network of U.S. government projects involving over 150,000 participants. We show that a seemingly localized disruption, affecting only one project site, eventually causes delays across unrelated projects. This is because participants opportunistically reallocate resources into disrupted projects, at the expense of other projects, triggering a domino effect of further reallocations in the network. Thus, the costs of on-site disruptions end up being shared by multiple participants in the network, rather than being fully absorbed by the affected project. Performance-based incentives, which reward contractors for timeliness, exacerbate these externalities by encouraging self-interested resource reallocation.This paper was accepted by Karan Girotra, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [Grant RGPIN-2017-04523].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01574 .</content>

    <title>Routine and Innovative Use of Enterprise System: Intricacy of Change Management Levers, System Characteristics, and Regulatory Focus</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study explores how organizational contexts, system design, and individual differences shape employees’ use of enterprise systems (ESs) and their impact on job outcomes. By examining leadership styles (transactional versus transformational), support structures (impersonal versus personal), and system characteristics (modularity and complexity), we highlight the role of employees’ situational regulatory focus (prevention versus promotion) in determining routine and innovative use of ES. Our findings show that leadership and support structures affect ES usage through employees’ regulatory focus, with transactional leadership and impersonal support fostering routine use and transformational leadership and personal support encouraging innovative use. System modularity enhances the relationship between prevention focus and routine use, whereas complexity strengthens the link between promotion focus and innovative use but weakens the relationship between prevention focus and routine ES use. Both routine and innovative ES use influence the employees’ job outcomes, including job performance and satisfaction. For organizations, this means that effective change management and ES design should align with employees’ regulatory focus and leadership strategies to maximize system adoption and improve performance. This study offers practical insights for designing more effective ES implementation strategies and tailoring support to boost employee engagement and outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study how the secular decline in interest rates affects banks' intermediation spreads and credit supply. Following a permanent decrease in rates, bank lending may rise initially but contracts in the long run. As lower rates compress deposit spreads even well above the zero lower bound, banks' retained earnings, equity, and lending fall until loan spreads have risen enough to offset the reduction in deposit spreads. A higher inflation target can support bank lending at the cost of higher liquidity premia. I find support for the model's predictions in U.S. aggregate and bank‐level data.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper highlights the simple fact that households typically consist of multiple members who may hold divergent views, a fact that existing approaches to measuring and modeling household macroeconomic expectations largely abstract from. Using unique data on the macroeconomic expectations of both spouses, I document substantial intrahousehold disagreement about inflation, economic recessions, and stock market returns. I further show that household asset allocation decisions are shaped by disagreement between spouses about future stock returns, and a preregistered randomized survey experiment confirms the causal impact of such disagreement on portfolio choice.</content>
