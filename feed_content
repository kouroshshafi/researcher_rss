    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify phrases associated with novel technologies using textual analysis of patents, job postings, and earnings calls, enabling us to identify four stylized facts on the diffusion of jobs relating to new technologies. First, the development of economically impactful new technologies is geographically highly concentrated, more so even than overall patenting: 56% of the most economically impactful technologies come from just two U.S. locations, Silicon Valley and the Northeast Corridor. Second, as the technologies mature and the number of related jobs grows, hiring spreads geographically. But this process is very slow, taking around 50 years to disperse fully. Third, while initial hiring in new technologies is highly skill biased, over time the mean skill level in new positions declines, drawing in an increasing number of lower-skilled workers. Finally, the geographic spread of hiring is slowest for higher-skilled positions, with the locations where new technologies were pioneered remaining the focus for the technology's high-skill jobs for decades.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crowdsourcing contests allow firms to seek ideas from external solvers to address their problems. This research examines solvers’ use of developmental feedback from different sources and of different constructiveness when generating ideas in contests. I theorize a source effect in solvers’ feedback use where they use seeker feedback more than peer feedback, even if both give identical suggestions for their ideas. I also show how the source effect affects solvers’ use of constructive and less constructive feedback from the respective sources. An insight is that compared with their use of peer feedback, solvers’ use of seeker feedback is more extensive at any level of, but less sensitive to, feedback constructiveness. An implication is that solvers may underuse constructive peer feedback and overuse less constructive seeker feedback. Such behaviors can be solver optimal (in terms of improving solvers’ winning prospects) but not seeker optimal (in terms of enhancing ideas for seekers’ problems), as constructive feedback is likely to improve idea quality, whereas less constructive feedback may hurt it. I propose a priming intervention of a feedback evaluation mechanism to mitigate the source effect in solvers’ feedback use—in a way, the intervention can cause solvers to behave more optimally for the seekers. A field survey and three online experiments test the theorizing and proposed intervention. I discuss the contributions and implications of this research for various stakeholders in crowdsourcing contests.Funding: This work was supported by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council [Grant 16502518].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2021.15885 .</content>

    <title>How Social Movements Catalyze Firm Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the impact that social movements have on firm innovation through private politics. We argue that firms strategically respond to private politics by investing in new technologies that address movement-advocated issues material to firms’ performance. Although both contentious private politics—when activists contentiously target firms—and cooperative private politics—when activists and firms collaborate—catalyze innovation, they do so in different ways. Contentious private politics increases the amount of innovation that firms undertake by drawing managerial attention to movement-advocated issues material to the firm, prompting search for solutions to those issues. Conversely, cooperative private politics provides firms access to new knowledge that encourages firms to search for solutions in areas more distant from their existing knowledge and in so doing, increase innovation involving distant recombination on material issues. We find support for our arguments in a matched sample of firms contentiously targeted and with activist collaborations on climate change issues and firms that were not targets of private politics on those issues but had otherwise similar histories of climate-related innovation and relationships with climate movements and other environmental movements. Supplementary analyses corroborate the mechanisms that undergird our theoretical predictions; contentious private politics is associated with more innovation closer to a firm’s expertise, whereas cooperative private politics is associated with innovations that draw on more distant knowledge. We also find that when collaboration follows contention, their respective impacts on innovation are reduced, which may result from firms seeking collaborations for their legitimacy-granting benefits after contention rather than the learning opportunities they offer.Funding: Funding for this research was provided by the Strategic Management Society Strategy Research Foundation [dissertation grant] and Wharton’s Mack Institute for Innovation Management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17497 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how the level of detail in legal regulations impacts crowdfunding. We find that clear, explicit regulations significantly boost crowdfunding volumes in a global sample of digital finance. Using proxies to measure regulatory detail in three types of countries—countries that sometimes, always, or never had regulation—in a series of difference-in-difference regressions, we show a significant positive relation between regulatory clarity and the level of debt crowdfunding. There is little effect on the level of equity crowdfunding. Clear regulations appear to encourage the creation of new crowdfunding platforms rather than concentrating activity in existing ones.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01538 .</content>

    <title>The Effect of Functional Diversity on Team Creativity: Behavioral and fNIRS Evidence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Variation in functional expertise is an important decision that managers face when designing teams tasked with being creative. We develop theory that predicts that functional diversity has countervailing effects on team creativity through its positive (negative) effect on the uniqueness (usefulness) of the proposals generated. We conduct an experiment where functionally homogeneous or heterogeneous two-person teams are tasked with proposing a creative use for an unused university space. We measure the uniqueness, usefulness, and overall creativity of team proposals. We also use functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging technology to investigate the underlying team cognitive processes. Measured outcomes and fNIRS data support our predictions. Combining conventional experiment and advanced neuroimaging techniques, our study informs theory and practice by providing evidence of how functional diversity affects team creativity.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NA) [Grant 72172132] and CPA Ontario’s Centre for Sustainability Reporting and Performance Management (NA).Supplemental Material: The online supplemental appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02157 .</content>

    <title>Managerial Ability and Labor Investment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The capability of higher-ability managers to acquire and use resources more efficiently than lower-ability managers suggests a positive linear relation between labor investment efficiency (LIE) and managerial ability (MA). However, a puzzle emerges about how the best managers set themselves apart from their peers, calling into question the linearity of the relation between LIE and MA. We explore this puzzle by asking how the highest-ability managers achieve the highest performance levels. We then investigate this puzzle empirically by considering alternatives to a linear relation between LIE and MA. We begin with the distinction that managers achieve the highest performance when they combine efficient exploitation of existing products and services with successful exploration for innovations in products and services. This point is relevant to our puzzle because a firm’s labor needs for exploration are high and unpredictable. Thus, we expect the highest-ability managers to purposefully invest more than predicted by a model of optimal labor investment across firms. In contrast, we expect low-ability managers, who are less able to evaluate, forecast, and make efficient investments, to deviate more from predicted labor investment and vacillate between over- and underinvestment. We present evidence that supports our predictions of nonlinear relations between LIE and MA, with high-ability managers investing more than predicted and low-ability managers over- and underinvesting. We make and test related hypotheses about exploration (investment in research and development), and we probe further by relating future firm performance to over- and underinvestment in labor for different levels of MA.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the CPA Alberta Education Foundation.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.01932 .</content>

    <title>When Neurodiversity and Ethnicity Combine: Intersectional Stereotyping and Workplace Experiences of Neurodivergent Ethnic Minority Employees</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the workplace experiences of 51 ethnic minority professionals who self‐identify as neurodivergent, focusing specifically on the impact of intersectional stereotyping within organizations in the United Kingdom and United States. Drawing on models of intersectional stereotyping, the research explores how neurodivergent employees' racial or ethnic minority backgrounds influence their self‐perceptions and experiences regarding prevailing stereotypes in professional environments. Semi‐structured interviews reveal that neurodiversity intersects with ethnicity, to either amplify or mitigate prevailing stereotypes during recruitment, performance evaluations, and career progression. Specifically, for Black and Latinx professionals, neurodiversity intensifies pejorative assumptions, reinforcing deficit stereotypes, while for Asian participants, neurodiversity can contradict the “model minority” stereotype. Neurodivergent behaviors are often seen as cultural mismatches with dominant norms, leading individuals to employ identity management strategies for professional advancement. This study extends general HRM diversity and neurodiversity research agendas by elucidating salient intragroup differences at this intersection, expanding intersectional stereotyping literature to include neurodiversity, and underscoring the practical need for integrated organizational inclusion initiatives that address the complex interrelationships between ethnicity and neurodiversity.</content>

    <title>The King Is Dead – Long Live Who? A Family and Firm Embeddedness Perspective on Succession after the CEO‐Owner's Sudden Death</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When the CEO‐owner of an SME suddenly dies, who should take over? Integrating the social embeddedness perspective with research on crisis management, we theorize that an SME's financial health gets progressively worse before it stabilizes and recovers, reflecting an inverse U‐shaped relationship between time since the CEO‐owner's sudden death and an SME's financial distress. We then explore how successors' family and firm embeddedness moderate this relationship. Using a longitudinal sample of Swedish SMEs, we find general support for our theorizing. While nonfamily successors lead to less financial distress than family successors immediately following a CEO‐owner's sudden death, the opposite occurs in the long term. Further, successors with high firm embeddedness are associated with less financial distress than those with low firm embeddedness in both the short‐ and long‐term. Additionally, our post‐hoc analyses reveal that successors with high firm embeddedness, independent of their family embeddedness, outperform those low in firm embeddedness. Family successors lacking firm embeddedness report the highest financial distress, whereas family successors with high firm embeddedness experience the lowest. Our social embeddedness perspective on succession after the CEO‐owner's sudden death therefore contends that successor embeddedness explains differences in an SME's financial health, with the importance of successor firm tenure overshadowing the effect of family status.</content>

    <title>Flexible Revenue-Sharing Contract in a Digital-Content Supply Chain Under Heterogeneous Beliefs of the Parties</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the design of a novel, flexible revenue-sharing contract between a platform and an app developer (or other digital content provider) when the parties hold heterogeneous beliefs with regard to the future income. The current contracts adopted by platforms in reality invoke a policy of two or three commission levels based on historical revenue data. We design a contract in which the commission is a continuous function of the revenue generated by the app or other digital content within the current period. In contrast to the majority of prior studies in operations management, which analyze the homogeneous beliefs scenario, we introduce heterogeneous beliefs, which turn out to be a crucial consideration in designing the contract structure. We use game theory and calculus of variations to derive the conditions to be satisfied by the flexible contract. Two criteria are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed flexible contract: the benefit gained by each party and the complexity of the negotiation (measured by the number of contract terms). The best linear contract serves as a performance benchmark. We show that the flexible contract has the potential to enhance the relationship between platforms and digital content providers. In particular, using extensive numerical analysis (based on 99,225 instances in a full factorial design), we demonstrate that the proposed contract may yield an improvement in expected profits of more than 100% compared with the best linear contract, and we identify the conditions under which the flexible contract achieves a substantial improvement relative to the benchmark. Moreover, the flexible contract outperforms the best linear contract in 99% of cases—the former is either more profitable while entailing the same level of negotiation complexity, or it has the same profitability but a lower level of negotiation complexity. In the remaining 1% of studied cases, the flexible contract is preferable in terms of profitability, but the best linear contract involves less negotiation friction, such that neither contract dominates the other. Based on real data, we demonstrate the applicability and advantages of the flexible contract for a scenario within the video games industry.</content>

    <title>Are non‐economic goals and financial performance friends or foes in hybrid ventures? A duality perspective on academic spin‐offs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study draws on the behavioral theory of the firm and a duality perspective to investigate the impact of founders' focus on academic goals on the financial performance of academic spin‐offs (ASOs)—a specific type of hybrid venture. We theorize that such relationship follows an inverse U‐shaped curve and is moderated by the degree of academic ownership. These hypotheses are tested using a sample of 179 Italian ASOs. Our findings indicate that when academic ownership is low, the relationship displays an inverted U‐shape. Moreover, as academic ownership increases, the relationship flattens and eventually shifts to a U‐shape. These results challenge the prevailing notion of inherent conflicts between economic and non‐economic logics in hybrid ventures, demonstrating when focusing on non‐economic (e.g., academic) goals enhances financial outcomes.Managerial SummaryAcademic spin‐offs (ASOs) play a pivotal role in science commercialization and often pursue academic goals due to their academic origins. However, the extent to which founders' focus on academic goals benefits or hinders ASOs' financial performance has remained largely underexamined. In this study of 179 Italian ASOs, we investigate the relationship between a focus on academic goals and firm performance. Our findings reveal that at lower levels of academic ownership, a moderate focus on academic goals is optimal for ASOs' financial performance. Conversely, at higher levels of academic ownership, either a low or high focus on academic goals proves optimal for financial performance. These insights can help practitioners improve ASO performance by aligning goal and ownership structures.</content>

    <title>How government procurement shapes corporate climate disclosures, commitments, and actions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how government procurement impacts firms’ environmental disclosures and whether they have tangible effects. Using a triple-difference research design that exploits the exogenous increase in federal funding allocations to counties based on population census revisions, we find that firms with high exposure to government contracts significantly increase climate disclosure following expanded procurement opportunities. We also document that enhanced disclosure is characterized by a positive tone that emphasizes firms’ green investment and commitment to climate adaptation. The effect is more pronounced in counties with a greater increase in procurement volume and when firms have lower ex ante sustainability performance. Finally, we find firms that increase climate disclosure are more likely to earn government contracts, and they undertake real actions by reducing toxic emissions and enhancing the development of green products. Overall our results suggest government procurement promotes corporate climate responsibility by incentivizing firms to undertake climate mitigation actions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I develop a model of the social construction of race. Racial categories emerge from labour conflict when elites privilege intrinsically irrelevant traits to divide workers against each other and extract workers’ surplus. I show that elites use colour to grant unequal rights and track these rights across generations because it is heritable, observable, and relatively immutable. Depending on the demographic conditions the elites face, the system of racialization manifests either as ‘ancestry-based’ or ‘colour-based’ categories. This approach to the social construction of race provides a unified explanation of skin tone inequality, racial homophily in marriage, the social status of mixed-race people, the ‘psychological wage’ of Jim Crow, and legal restrictions on manumission. I test for historical variations in racial boundaries using census data from the United States and Brazil and for differential patterns of skin tone inequality between ancestry-based and colour-based systems using survey data from across the Americas.</content>

    <title>“Something Works” in U.S. Jails: Misconduct and Recidivism Effects of the IGNITE Program</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A longstanding and influential view in U.S. correctional policy is that “nothing works” when it comes to rehabilitating incarcerated individuals. We revisit this hypothesis by studying an innovative law-enforcement-led program launched in the county jail of Flint, Michigan: Inmate Growth Naturally and Intentionally Through Education (IGNITE). We develop an instrumental variable approach to estimate the effects of IGNITE exposure, leveraging quasi-random court delays that cause individuals to spend more time in jail both before and after the program’s launch. Holding time in jail fixed, we find that one additional month of IGNITE exposure reduces weekly misconduct within jail by 25% and three-month recidivism by 24%, with the recidivism effects growing over time. Surveys of staff and community members, along with administrative test score records and within-jail text messages, suggest that cultural change and improved literacy and numeracy scores are contributing mechanisms.</content>

    <title>Revealed Wisdom of the Crowd: Bids Predict Loan Quality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the popularity of the phrase “wisdom of the crowd,” not all crowds are wise because not everyone in them acts in an informed, rational manner. Identifying informative actions, therefore, can help to isolate the truly wise part of a crowd. Motivated by this idea, we evaluate the informational value of investors’ bids using data from online, debt-based crowdfunding, in which we were able to track both investment decisions and ultimate repayment statuses for individual loans. We propose several easily scalable variables derived from the heterogeneity of investors’ bids in terms of size and timing. We first show that loans funded with larger bids relative to the typical bid amount in the market or to the bidder’s historical baseline, particularly early in the bidding period, are less likely to default. More importantly, we perform theory-driven feature engineering and find that these variables improve the predictive performance of state-of-the-art models that have been proposed in this context. Even during the fundraising process, these variables improve predictions of both funding likelihood and loan quality. We discuss the implications of these variables, including loan pricing in secondary markets, crowd wisdom in different market mechanisms, and financial inclusion. Crowdfunding platforms can easily implement these variables to improve market efficiency without compromising investor privacy.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, information systems.Funding: We gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Business Analytics Center in the Scheller College of Business and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02575 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a novel 15-year data set on surgeon adoption of a complex surgical innovation in the English National Health Service and an identification strategy based on surgeon mobility, this paper disentangles three channels of coworker influence on innovation diffusion: (1) peer network size, (2) influential “key players,” and (3) cumulative peer adoption. We find that a one standard deviation in peer connections boost innovation by 16%. Key players can either amplify or dampen diffusion, and peer adoption has a greater impact on less experienced individuals. These results highlight the value of targeting training to high impact network members to speed up diffusion. This work advances our understanding of how professional networks shape innovation diffusion, with implications for technology implementation.This paper was accepted by Stefan Scholtes, healthcare management.Funding: This work was supported by the European Research Council (ANR-17-EURE-0010, POEMH, Advanced Investigator Award HealthCareLabour REP-SCI-788529), the Australian Research Council (Discovery Project DP220101043) and the Health Foundation (Efficiency Research Programme).Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00496 .</content>

    <title>Designing Information to Engage Customers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Collaborative customization is common in many markets. Sellers and customers can collectively discover the value of the product’s basic design. Customers’ willingness to pay can also be increased by being engaged to improve the product design. We study how a seller can design the information structure of collective learning about the product’s basic value to induce costly customer engagement. We consider a setting in which the parties’ expected payoffs are determined endogenously through the strategic interaction between seller pricing and customer engagement and purchase. The customer tends to be engaged in equilibrium, as the uncertainty on the product’s basic value becomes higher to dilute the responsiveness of the optimal price to customer engagement. Therefore, the seller seeks to maximize the probability of generating an intermediate posterior belief. Thus, the optimal information design involves either exaggerating or downplaying the product’s basic value when the prior is low or high, respectively. We show that considering restrictive information structures can generate qualitatively different implications. We also examine how the unobservability of engagement may influence the parties’ strategic interaction, their expected payoffs, and the seller-optimal information design. Interestingly, unobservability may lead to lower equilibrium engagement, hurt the seller, render the customer’s equilibrium expected payoff to increase as customer engagement becomes less important or more costly, and yield more or less information provision.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.</content>

    <title>Can Socially Minded Governance Control the Artificial General Intelligence Beast?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper robustly concludes that it cannot. A model is constructed under idealized conditions that presume that the risks associated with artificial general intelligence (AGI) are real, that safe AGI products are possible, and that there exist socially minded funders who are interested in funding safe AGI, even if this does not maximize profits. It is demonstrated that a socially minded entity formed by such funders would not be able to minimize harm from AGI that unrestricted products released by for-profit firms might create. The reason is that a socially minded entity can only minimize the use of unrestricted AGI products in ex post competition with for-profit firms at a prohibitive financial cost and so, does not preempt the AGI developed by for-profit firms ex ante.This paper was accepted by Maria Guadalupe, business strategy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One may reasonably think that cultural homophily, defined as the tendency to associate with others of similar culture, affects collaboration in multinational teams in general but not in superstar teams of professionals at the top of their industry. The analysis of an exhaustive data set on the passes made by professional European football players in the top five men’s leagues reveals that on the contrary, cultural homophily is persistent, pervasive, and consequential, even in superstar multinational teams of very-high-skill individuals with clear common objectives and aligned incentives who are involved in interactive tasks that are well defined and not particularly culture intensive.This paper was accepted by Olav Sorenson, organizations.Funding: G.

    <title>How Imprints Transcend Era and Terra: A Study of Firms' Controversial History and Present‐Day Foreign Market Entry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do certain historical events transcend generational and geographic boundaries to shape firm strategy? We explore this question by examining how certain German firms' present‐day foreign market entry is influenced by their past leaders' support of Hitler and the Nazi Party, or Nazi imprint. We argue that this imprint persists through two mechanisms: (1) internal organizational alertness to their controversial past and (2) external collective memory sustained by Jewish communities worldwide. When Nazi‐imprinted German firms consider entering locations where their past might provoke controversy, they tend to seek informational cues from peers with the same imprint. This results in a positive relationship between the number of subsidiaries their peers have in such controversial locations and the number of new subsidiaries established by the focal firm. To illustrate these mechanisms, we argue that the communist purge in the former East Germany has reduced organizational alertness to the controversial past and thus weakened the relationship. In contrast, commemorative efforts by synagogues around the world have strengthened the collective memory, thereby reinforcing the relationship. We employ two longitudinal samples to test these hypotheses, focusing on German firms' entries into (1) non‐German cities worldwide with significant Jewish populations and (2) US counties with neo‐Nazi hate groups. We obtain robust evidence supporting our hypotheses. By demonstrating the role of extra‐organizational carriers in maintaining historical imprints and challenging the notion that inertia alone sustains them, our research advances imprinting theory and sheds light on the role of history in international business.</content>

    <title>When A Political Sinner Does A Good Deed: The Role of Government Officials' Stigma Anxiety in Granting Political Access</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines when firms with damaged political reputations – political officials' negative perceptions of a firm's capabilities and character – attempt to restore their reputations and regain political access through an essential form of Corporate Political Activities (CPA), Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). We focus on the officials' incentives and introduce the concept of stigma anxiety, which refers to officials' concerns about being associated with reputationally damaged firms. Analysing 3531 Chinese firms from 2012 to 2020 in the context of China's anticorruption campaigns, we find that officials are less likely to grant political access to firms with damaged political reputations. However, CSR activities may mitigate these adverse effects. The effectiveness of CSR activities in regaining political access is further influenced by officials' stigma anxiety, shaped by three factors: controllability (the extent to which a stigmatized actor is perceived as responsible for the stigma), disruptiveness (the degree to which stigma is perceived as a threat to others), and visibility (the extent to which a stigma event stands out and attracts sustained attention). Our findings contribute to research on CPA, stigma, and CSR.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop an extensive mapping of the revolving door phenomenon by examining the work experience of 420,153 individuals in top corporate positions at 12,869 firms. More than half of these firms have at least one such individual with prior experience in one of 187 executive branch agencies. We find that firms are more likely to receive procurement contracts following the appointment of a former regulator transitioning within 2 years of leaving the agency, a result consistent with the “knowledge” hypothesis. Less-complex contracts signed following the appointment of former regulators are more likely to be renegotiated, increasing costs for the government.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using transaction-level trade data from China Customs and loan data from the China Development Bank (CDB), we find that CDB credit to strategic industries at the top of supply chains leads to lower prices, higher volume, and more product varieties and destinations for exports for firms in downstream industries. These positive spillovers stem from reduced intermediate goods prices and increased trade credit from upstream to downstream firms caused by CDB loans. Notably, this surge in import activity displaces U.S. firms within the same industry but bolsters downstream U.S. firms’ business performance and employment.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms enter new sectors by either building on their resources or buying existing companies. Using French administrative data, we propose a measure of human capital distance between a firm and a sector of entry. Using a shift-share instrument, we show that firms build in close sectors and buy in distant sectors in terms of human capital distance. Firms build by hiring new workers, which becomes increasingly costly in distant sectors as it requires not only hiring more workers but also having more organizational capital to integrate these workers. Hence, firms buy in distant sectors to acquire already operational human capital. (JEL L25, J24, J30, G34)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A combinatorial market consists of a set of indivisible goods and a set of buyers, where each buyer has a valuation function that represents the buyer’s preferences over the subsets of items. In the dynamic pricing model, the buyers arrive in a sequential order, and each buyer selects a bundle of the remaining items that maximizes her utility. The buyers’ preferences are known in advance, and the seller is allowed to update the prices between the arrivals of buyers based upon the remaining set of items but without knowing the identity of the next buyer. We study the existence of optimal dynamic prices under fairness constraints in unit-demand markets and propose five possible notions of envy-freeness depending on the period over which agents compare themselves to others: the entire time horizon, only the past, only the future, a mixture of the two, or only the present.</content>

Their approach leads to an algorithm with the highest possible competitive ratio, a result that was previously out of reach with the algorithms and techniques that are used in classic settings in which resources are nonreusable. More generally, their LP-free analysis approach is useful for analyzing the performance of online algorithms for various other settings in which the standard primal-dual approach fails.</content>

    <title>A Preregistered Falsification Test of the Decision by Sampling Model and Rank-Order Effect</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many social scientists have assumed that people’s preferences can be described by stable and coherent “utility” functions. This notion of stable utility functions has been challenged by cognitive psychologists who suggest that preferences are malleable and constructed in the moment, but neither camp has explained how the subjective valuations underpinning preferences arise. One influential attempt to do so is the Decision by Sampling (DbS) model, which suggests that a quantitative attribute’s (e.g., money sum’s) subjective value is its rank order in a momentarily activated memory sample. DbS thus implies that manipulating the recently experienced attribute distribution should change people’s subsequent valuations of that attribute: for example, from the typically assumed concave shape of the utility function to a convex shape. However, recent studies have pointed out methodological concerns in the evidence previously thought to support this prediction (and thus, DbS). In this preregistered study, we replicate the previous paradigm but address the methodological concerns to test if such a “rank-order” manipulation does change valuations. We derive qualitative predictions from DbS to verify that our conditions yield distinct predictions. We find strong evidence against the DbS’s prediction that a “rank-order” manipulation changes what options the participants select and how strongly they prefer the options. We also find extreme evidence in favor of a contextualization effect, implying that people value formally identical gambles differently depending on whether they cue a real-life setting or not. Although we encourage replication by independent laboratories, these results suggest that the DbS is falsified for this binary choice task.This paper was accepted by Yuval Rottenstreich, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This research was funded by the Marcus and Amalia Wallenberg Foundation [Grant MAW 2016.0132] and the Swedish Research School of Management and IT.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03611 .</content>

    <title>Sampling-Based Approximation for Series Inventory Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study inventory management of an infinite-horizon, series system with multiple stages. Each stage orders from its immediate upstream stage, and the most upstream stage orders from an external supplier. Random demand with unknown distribution occurs at the most downstream stage. Each stage incurs inventory holding cost while the most downstream stage also incurs demand backlogging cost when it experiences inventory shortage. The objective is to minimize the expected total discounted cost over the planning horizon. We apply the sample average approximation (SAA) method to obtain a heuristic policy (SAA policy) using the empirical distribution function constructed from a demand sample (of the underlying demand distribution). We derive an upper bound of sample size (viz., distribution-free bound) that guarantees that the performance of the SAA policy be close (i.e., with arbitrarily small relative error) to the optimal policy under known demand distribution with high probability. This result is obtained by first deriving a separable and tight cost upper bound of the whole system that depends on (given) echelon base-stock levels and then showing that the cost difference between the SAA and optimal policies can be measured by the distance between the empirical and the underlying demand distribution functions. We also provide a lower bound of sample size that matches the upper bound (in the order of relative error). Furthermore, when the demand distribution is continuous and has an increasing failure rate (IFR), we derive a tighter sample size upper bound (viz., distribution-dependent bound). Both distribution-free and distribution-dependent bounds for the newsvendor problem, a special case of our series system, improve the previous results. In addition, we show that both bounds increase polynomially as the number of stages increases. The performance of SAA policy and the sample size bounds are illustrated numerically. Finally, we extend the results to finite-horizon series systems.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Funding: K.

    <title>Crowdfunding Success for Female Versus Male Entrepreneurs Depends on Whether a Consumer Versus Investor Decision Frame Is Salient</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ensuring equal access to entrepreneurship and startup funding for both female and male entrepreneurs is crucial for societal perceptions of justice and long-term prosperity. Previous research presents contrasting findings, with some studies indicating a male advantage and others suggesting a female advantage. This research reconciles these inconsistencies by identifying the decision frame as a moderator. Specifically, in crowdfunding contexts, a consumer decision frame leads to stronger reliance on communal evaluation norms, resulting in favoring female entrepreneurs who are perceived as more disadvantaged. Conversely, an investor decision frame leads to stronger reliance on exchange evaluation norms, resulting in favoring male entrepreneurs who are perceived as more determined/passionate. Based on this, the authors propose that the strategic use of an entrepreneur's profile, activating a specific evaluation norm, and showing crowdfunding dependence attenuate the differential support for female versus male entrepreneurs, resulting in equal support for both. Results from six studies using a multimethod design provide converging support for this framework. This research is the first to differentiate between and directly compare consumer and investor decision frames, advancing the related literature and offering valuable guidelines for entrepreneurs, funding platforms, and public policy makers.</content>

    <title>Collective Layoffs and Offshoring: A Social Contract Account</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Collective layoffs can occur for many reasons, often related to a firm’s pursuit of greater efficiency and cost reduction, and they tend to trigger negative reactions among the public. Anecdotal evidence suggests that offshoring, one of the most controversial and politicized aspects of globalization, evokes particularly negative reactions. We propose a social contract account of consumer reactions to collective layoffs and demonstrate differential consumer responses to collective layoffs due to offshoring versus other reasons, such as automation. Layoffs due to offshoring are perceived as an especially egregious violation of the normative expectation that firms should support members of their society. Data from nine experimental studies (N = 5,568; seven reported in the main paper and two in the General Discussion), public consumer responses to layoffs in a large online community (N = 29,045), and layoff announcements in the European Union (N = 1,261) show that consumers react more negatively to collective layoffs due to offshoring compared to other reasons. Supporting our social contract account, the negative effect of offshoring is stronger when offshoring affects workers in the consumers’ home (vs. foreign) country, when the firm is domestic (vs. foreign), and when most customers are domestic (vs. foreign).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how people (as observers) anticipate levels of happiness from psychological consumption experiences (e.g., learning a new language or visiting a park). All else being equal, we propose and demonstrate that people expect differences in happiness based on income. Specifically, we show that relative to observers themselves, individuals simultaneously expect low-income consumers to enjoy psychological consumption experiences less and high-income consumers to enjoy them more. This is because consumers hold a lay theory that human needs must be fulfilled in a sequential, linear manner, which leads to income-based inferences of need prioritization. Thus, observers simultaneously believe that low-income consumers do (and should) prioritize their low-level physical needs first, but high-income consumers (who have presumably already fulfilled their physical needs) can prioritize their high-level psychological needs. Critically, we demonstrate that these lay theory-driven inferences are faulty, showing that the priority level assigned to these needs and the actual happiness resulting from psychological consumption experiences do not follow the predicted pattern. Namely, income either has no relationship with actual happiness (visitors to theme parks, sporting events, and concerts), or the reverse relationship, such that lower-income consumers report greater happiness than higher-income consumers (secondary data from a major league professional sports team).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managers draw on their informal networks of peers outside of their firm to better understand uncertain markets and help their firms adapt. This helps firms enhance their performance in information environments characterized by idiosyncratic and difficult‐to‐standardize soft information. However, in information environments characterized by standardized hard information, joint discussions facilitated by informal networks can make managers and their firms maladaptive towards uncertain markets. Based on the performance of two different categories of hedge funds during the 2008 financial crisis, we find that long–short funds, which heavily draw on soft information, performed better when embedded into networks of closely connected managers. In contrast, relative value funds, which heavily draw on hard information, performed better when their managers were more disconnected.Managerial SummaryWhen are managers’ professional networks with peers in the industry valuable to the firm? We examined how hedge fund managers performed during the 2008 financial crisis to find out. When fund managers worked primarily with idiosyncratic and difficult‐to‐standardized soft information, we found that their networks helped them make sense of such information. In contrast, when fund managers worked primarily with quantified and codified hard information (e.g., financial statements and ratings), we found that their networks became echo chambers reinforcing similar opinions, which caused managers to fail to adapt quickly to the market crisis. Our findings counterintuitively suggest that funds using hard information may better off hiring relatively isolated managers who are not deeply tied to the industry.</content>

    <title>The Direct Effect of Managerial Responses: When Politeness Backfires</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managerial responses, which represent firms’ public replies to online reviews, are commonly employed in customer communications. Using a dataset collected from a leading mobile game app platform in China, this research examines the effect of managerial responses on the review updates of customers who receive them, that is, the direct effect of managerial responses. Platform users can update their reviews, and complete records of review updates are observable, which allows us to utilize variations in the same customer’s review ratings of a single game both before and after receiving a managerial response. Addressing concerns regarding the endogeneity of managerial responses, improvements in game quality, and censored data in rating updates, we find that users who update their reviews after receiving managerial responses upgrade their ratings by an average of one star. In addition, we find that the positive direct effect of managerial responses is negatively moderated by the level of response politeness, measured separately using both machine learning and large language models. By conducting a survey study, we further show that as the level of politeness increases, the likelihood of reviewers perceiving a managerial response as an attempt to persuade them also increases. These findings highlight the positive direct effect of managerial response and the importance of response style, specifically politeness, which can produce a backfire effect in online communications.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Investor Learning in Crowdfunded Supply Chain Finance Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crowdfunded Supply Chain Finance (SCF) represents a novel market design that transforms financial flows within the SCF paradigm. It enables crowd investors to serve as financers, lending vital working capital to suppliers facing liquidity problems. A distinctive feature of this market is the mandatory involvement of loan guarantors, which facilitates repeated interactions between investors and fundraisers, potentially fostering investor learning. To understand how such learning dynamics shape investor decision-making, we develop a Bayesian learning model that conceptualizes investor perceptions of guarantor reliability as a subjective attitude underlying the perceived risk of a loan listing. The model posits that investors can learn about a guarantor’s reliability through a series of scheduled repayments involving the same guarantor over time.We consider investor decision-making a joint process comprising two interdependent components: (1) the incidence decision of whether to invest and (2) the amount decision of how much to invest. Our results reveal that investor perceptions of guarantor reliability play a crucial role in shaping both decisions, albeit in distinct ways. While perceived reliability exerts a positive, monotonic effect on amount decisions, its impact on incidence decisions follows an inverted U-shaped pattern. Furthermore, perceived reliability attenuates the positive effect of loan interest rates on both decisions, suggesting that the appeal of higher returns diminishes as investors’ reliability perceptions increase. A posterior analysis further shows that offering high interest rates may become counterproductive when perceived reliability is sufficiently high. These findings provide actionable implications for platform designers and participants in crowdfunded SCF markets.</content>

    <title>Tapping into User Effort? Improving Referral Outcomes in Crowdfunding Markets</title>
    <updated>2025-01-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Referral programs have received increasing attention as a way to enhance project fundraising in crowdfunding. To improve operational efficiency and performance, many crowdfunding platforms allow users to exert more effort (referral effort) when making referrals. In this paper, we study the impact of users’ referral efforts on referral outcomes, using a unique data set from a reward-based crowdfunding platform. We analyze three types of referral effort beyond merely sharing the referral link, namely, writing the referral message, matching the referral recipients’ pledges, and supporting their own referrals. Our results suggest that users’ referral efforts can help improve the outcome of referrals, as these efforts may be perceived as positive signals of quality, thus reducing referral recipients’ uncertainty about the crowdfunding project. We further explore the heterogeneity in this observed impact, and find that matching recipients’ pledges have a greater impact than the other two types of referral effort. Furthermore, the impact of referral effort is attenuated under conditions of low uncertainty, wherein project quality can be inferred from observable features, such as projects launched by large creators, selected by editors, or referred by experienced backers. Our analyses also indicate that referring users’ efforts can collectively improve the fundraising performance of projects that receive referrals. We discuss the implications of our findings for platform managers, policy makers, and users in crowdfunding marketplaces.</content>

    <title>Coverage-Validity-Aware Algorithmic Recourse</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In “Coverage-Validity-Aware Algorithmic Recourse,” Bui, Nguyen, Yue, and Nguyen introduce a novel framework to enhance the explainability and robustness of algorithmic recourse in machine learning models. Algorithmic recourse provides actionable steps for individuals to achieve favorable outcomes from predictive models, addressing ethical and transparency challenges. However, existing methods often fail to account for the evolving nature of predictive models, rendering current recourses invalid as models update with new data. To address this, the authors propose a novel model-agnostic framework designed to generate recourses robust to future model shifts. The framework constructs a coverage-validity-aware linear surrogate of the nonlinear (black box) model for recourse generation, enabling recourses that remain valid across model updates. The approach leverages theoretical insights from minimax probability machines, demonstrating how varying covariance robustness recovers widely used regularizations, such as ℓ2regularization and class reweighting. This method holds promise for applications in credit scoring, hiring algorithms, and other domains where fairness, transparency, and adaptability are critical to maintaining trust and accountability in artificial intelligence systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Divide and Conquer: Solving the Euclidean Diversity Problem Through Coordinate PartitioningA common technique for solving difficult optimization problems is to break them into easier-to-manage pieces, yet it is rarely obvious how to do so. This is especially true for the Euclidean max-sum diversity problem, which becomes increasingly difficult as the number of coordinates grows despite the problem size remaining the same. In “Coordinate Partitioning for Difficult Euclidean Max-Sum Diversity Problems,” Spiers, Bui, and Loxton use an old result by Schoenberg to transform Euclidean distances into their squared counterparts, enabling a functional decomposition of the problem’s objective. The authors introduce novel partitioning strategies as well as a globally convergent cutting-plane algorithm, which can effectively solve high-dimension instances. They also present a new class of challenging instances characterized by locations on the surface of a hyperball.</content>

    <title>Groceries or School Cafeterias:  How Households Respond to School  Nutrition Mandates</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) placed strict nutritional mandates on meals served at U.S. public schools. This policy offers a unique opportunity to study household response to a large, exogenous change in healthiness of food available to their children. Did more healthy school meals lead households to substitute toward them, and away from grocery food purchases? Which households were more responsive to the nutritional mandates? And was there any spillover effect on the nutritional quality of their grocery food purchases? The authors document a meaningful decrease in the quantity of grocery food in response to the HHFKA, and a small decrease in quality. Consistent with substitution toward school meals, more of the quantity decrease is attributable to items likely to be purchased for children and categories traditionally associated with breakfast and lunch (the meals served at school). The HHFKA attracted even greater participation from financially constrained and time-constrained households for whom school meals were already important and were now coupled with the additional benefit of healthier food. These findings have important implications for policy makers and researchers, but also for food manufacturers and retailers.</content>

    <title>It's Amazing – But Terrifying!: Unveiling the Combined Effect of Emotional and Cognitive Trust on Organizational Member' Behaviours, AI Performance, and Adoption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conducted a qualitative, real‐life study where we tracked the introduction, implementation, and use of a new AI technology in a company. We identified four distinct trust configurations among organizational members: full trust (high cognitive/high emotional), full distrust (low cognitive/low emotional), uncomfortable trust (high cognitive/low emotional), and blind trust (low cognitive/high emotional). Furthermore, we found that organizational members exhibited distinct behaviours under the four trust configurations: Some responded by detailing their digital footprints, while others engaged in manipulating, confining, or withdrawing them. These behaviours triggered a ‘vicious cycle’, where biased (due to manipulation) and unbalanced and asymmetric (due to detailing, confining, or withdrawing) data inputs degraded AI performance, further eroding trust and stalling adoption. Our primary contribution is a model that explains how organizational members behave under different trust configurations and how these behaviours affect AI performance and, ultimately, AI adoption in organizations. We also provide valuable insights for managers.</content>

    <title>The “WEIRDEST” Organizations in the World? Assessing the Lack of Sample Diversity in Organizational Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sampling data from organizations and humans associated with those organizations is essential to organizational research. Much of what we know about organizations is based on such work. However, this empirical foundation may be compromised, calling into question the field’s theoretical and empirical findings. Studies often sample data from relatively similar, narrow contexts, so a lack of sample diversity accumulates in the discipline. To conceptualize this lack of sample diversity and examine its prevalence across research publications, we conduct a pre-registered systematic review of articles from 2018 to 2022 in six top management journals and another systematic review of articles from 2013 to 2022 in six additional journals (not pre-registered). Our review assesses sample country diversity while also exploring within-country factors that are relatively under or oversampled, such as the size or industry of the sampled organization. We find a lack of sample diversity, for instance, a strong bias toward WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) samples and an underrepresentation of small and medium-sized enterprises in organizational research. Based on the findings and past work, we introduce a conceptual framework for sample diversity along three dimensions: the sample’s geographical, organizational, and personnel contexts. Additionally, we discuss factors that contribute to a lack of sample diversity and propose guidelines for authors, reviewers, and editors to enhance it. Overall, this article seeks to improve the robustness and relevance of theoretical and empirical organizational research, thereby preventing the formulation of misinformed policies and practices in both organizational settings and broader societal contexts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Portfolio allocation decisions increasingly incorporate social values. We develop a tractable framework to study how competition between investors to own socially valuable assets affects social welfare. Relative to the most common social‐investing strategies, we identify alternative strategies that result in higher impact and higher financial returns. We identify strategies for investors to have impact when impact is difficult to measure. From the firm's perspective, increasing profitability can have greater impact than directly increasing social value. We present new empirical evidence on the social preferences of investors that demonstrates the practical relevance of our theory.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Long-term orientation has been proposed as one of the differences between family and nonfamily firms. Family business scholars base this difference theoretically on the incumbent generation’s altruism for the next generation and the intention for intrafamily succession. We point out that the applicable boundaries for these two theoretical bases are limited. We also point out misconceptions regarding what these two theoretical bases imply about the long-term oriented behavior of family businesses and discuss implications for empirical research and theory development.</content>

    <title>Community-Engaged School District Design: A Stream-Based Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;School district design decisions are a crucial part of public education systems, and operations research has played an important role in informing such decisions since the landmark United States Supreme Court decision on school desegregation in 1954. Design processes today place significant importance on comprehensive community engagement to create equitable and effective enrollment policies reflective of community needs and values. In “Community-Engaged School District Design: A Stream-Based Approach,” Ozel, Smilowitz, and Goldstein revisit the school district design problem with a focus on codesigning with community partners. The authors introduce a new compact formulation that makes multiple interrelated assignment decisions simultaneously with composite decision variables, called “streams.” This formulation is computationally efficient and easily reconfigurable for evolving problem specifications that are endemic to community codesign. These features were essential in the district redesign process in an Illinois public school district, described in the paper, allowing the community to iteratively develop proposals to address inequities in access to education and improve the student assignment process.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Machine data (MD), that is, data generated by machines, are increasingly gaining importance, potentially surpassing the value of the extensively discussed personal data. We present a theoretical analysis of the MD market, addressing challenges such as data fragmentation, ambiguous property rights, and the public-good nature of MD. We consider machine users producing data and data aggregators providing MD analytics services (e.g., with digital twins for real-time simulation and optimization). By analyzing machine learning algorithms, we identify critical properties for the value of MD analytics, Scale, Scope, and Synergy. We leverage these properties to explore market scenarios, including anonymous and secret contracting, competition among MD producers, and multiple competing aggregators. We identify significant inefficiencies and market failures, highlighting the need for nuanced policy interventions.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00674 .</content>

    <title>The Impact of Air Pollution on Consumer Spending</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Air pollution is a growing threat to economies and societies. Despite the common knowledge that air pollution impairs emotions and cognition and, hence, behavioral outcomes, the impact of air pollution on consumer spending remains an open question. Analyzing air quality readings and individual-level credit card transactions in South Korea, this article shows that consumers spend more money when air quality is poorer. This correlation is more prominent in hedonic categories, such as entertainment or leisure activities, where the nature of consumption is characterized by greater emotional benefits. The authors consider potential explanations, and the leading hypothesis is that consumers treat spending as a mood-regulating resource. The results survive an array of robustness checks and are supported in a controlled experiment, reinforcing a causal inference behind the main findings. The authors provide implications for stakeholders to develop a sustainable marketing program that not only pursues managerial interests but also concerns consumer welfare in the face of environmental change.</content>

    <title>Lost Time in Crowdsourcing Contests</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crowdsourcing contests are a popular way to seek innovative business solutions, but the availability of multiple contests can cause “lost time,” the delay between a contest’s start and a solver’s first visit. This study examines how lost time affects solvers’ submission behavior and its impact on matching inefficacy, measured by solver disqualification, which occurs when a solver fails to meet the seeker’s baseline submission criteria. Using mediation analysis, we show that lost time can increase matching inefficacy because solvers spend less time on their initial submissions and submit fewer solutions. Interestingly, we identify latecomer disadvantage as an important mechanism driving solvers’ behavioral responses to lost time, suggesting that simply increasing contest duration does not eliminate the issue. Instead, modifying submission behaviors through incentive structures—such as early bird bonuses—and continuous feedback may help alleviate the negative effects of lost time. Additionally, offering grace periods to late entrants can counterbalance the disadvantage of joining later. These strategies, informed by our findings, can enhance solver engagement and improve the effectiveness of crowdsourcing platforms in achieving desirable outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandates explicit user opt-in consent for data access. It recommends transparency in opt-in requests about data collection, storage, and use, without specifying the format of these requests. Consequently, the GDPR gives firms flexibility in designing opt-in messages. This research uses theory, multiple datasets, and methods to investigate firms’ communication formats for opt-in requests, addressing three questions: (1) How do firms design their opt-in requests? (2) Does the chosen format affect consumer response? (3) What drives firms’ choices of formats? The analysis of 1,506 repermission emails from 1,396 firms post-GDPR shows that 26% use only persuasive cues to request data, while 24% blend persuasive and informative cues. Notably, businesses with an offline presence use more persuasive cues compared with purely digital entities. A field experiment rationalizes this behavior showing that informative cues alone did not improve opt-in; a mix of persuasive and informative cues proved more successful. Additionally, firms dependent on personal data use persuasive cues more often than firms concerned with reputational risks of GDPR noncompliance. This study offers pivotal insights for regulators, firms, and consumers, revealing variations in how different firms acquire consent and the impact of their strategies on user behavior.</content>
