    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building on recent studies on founders' entry strategy and the attention‐based view, our study examines the underexplored relationship between entrepreneurial entry mode and funding performance. We offer a novel perspective on how different entry strategies—such as hybrid, portfolio, and full‐time entrepreneurship—impact start‐up performance. Additionally, we develop a theoretical framework highlighting founder attention as a mediator in this relationship. Our research was conducted in the crowdfunding context, with findings remaining consistent across multiple measures of founder attention and funding performance. To address potential endogeneity concerns, we employ two‐stage instrumental variable analyses and a propensity score matching method, ensuring the robustness of our results.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs' choice of entry strategy plays a critical role in shaping their ability to secure funding and drive their start‐up success. Our study highlights how different entry strategies—hybrid, portfolio, and full‐time entrepreneurship—affect funding performance, particularly in the crowdfunding context. A key insight is the role of founder attention in mediating the relationship between entry strategy and funding success. The way founders allocate their focus across different pursuits influences investor perceptions and financial outcomes. Therefore, aligning entry strategies with the ability to effectively manage and signal commitment to ventures is essential from a practical standpoint. Moreover, entrepreneurs and investors should consider how strategic entry choices impact not only operational execution but also the likelihood of securing financial support.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how shootings at schools—an increasingly common form of gun violence in the States—impact the educational and economic trajectories of students. Using linked schooling and labor market data in Texas from 1992 to 2018, we compare within-student and across-cohort changes in outcomes following a shooting to those experienced by students at matched control schools. We find that school shootings increase absenteeism and grade repetition, reduce high school graduation, college enrollment, and college completion; and reduce employment and earnings at ages 24–26 years. We further find school-level increases in the number of leadership staff and reductions in retention among teachers and teaching support staff in the years following a shooting. The adverse impacts of shootings span student characteristics, suggesting that the economic costs of school shootings are universal.</content>

    <title>Retractions: Updating from Complex Information</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We modify a canonical experimental design to identify the effectiveness of retractions. Comparing beliefs after retractions to beliefs (1) without the retracted information and (2) after equivalent new information, we find that retractions result in diminished belief updating in both cases. We propose this reflects updating from retractions being more complex, and our analysis supports this: we find longer response times, lower accuracy, and higher variability. The results—robust across diverse participant groups and design variations—enhance our understanding of belief updating and offer insights into addressing misinformation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Labour productivity in manufacturing differs starkly across regions in China. We document that productivity, wages, and start-up rates of non-state firms have nevertheless experienced rapid unconditional regional convergence after 1995. To analyse these patterns, we construct a Hopenhayn model that incorporates location-specific capital wedges, output wedges, and entry barriers. Using Chinese Industry Census data, we estimate these wedges and examine their role in explaining differences in performance and growth across prefectures. Entry barriers explain most of the differences. We investigate the empirical covariates of these entry barriers and find that changes in barriers are causally related to changes in the size of the state sector: a smaller state sector leads to lower entry barriers.</content>

    <title>A Stability Principle for Learning Under Nonstationarity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Adapting to a Changing Environment with Steady DecisionsMost real-world decision making unfolds in changing environments. When yesterday’s data may no longer depict today, how much past data should guide future decision making? Use too little and you chase noise; use too much and you overlook new trends. In “A Stability Principle for Learning under Nonstationarity,” Huang and Wang propose a simple stability principle: keep adding past data until the bias it incurs exceeds the natural statistical noise. Their theory shows that the proposed approach can optimally adapt to unforeseeable changes in the environment for a broad spectrum of statistical learning and decision-making problems. At its core are a novel similarity measure for different decision-making objectives and a segmentation technique that breaks down the nonstationary data stream into quasistationary pieces. Simulations and real-data experiments spanning several nonstationarity patterns confirm the approach’s ability to make steady yet responsive decisions.</content>

    <title>Monitoring, Performance Reviews, and Retaliation</title>
    <updated>2025-06-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the effects of retaliation on optimal contracts in a hierarchy consisting of a principal, a monitor, and an agent. With probability m, the monitor observes a signal about the agent’s effort and decides what to report to the principal. With probability [Formula: see text], the monitor only observes an uninformative default signal realization. The agent retaliates against the monitor and the principal whenever the monitor’s report reduces the agent’s payment from an endogenously determined default level. We show that the principal’s optimal contracting problem can be divided into two steps: First is an information acquisition stage. The principal chooses how much retaliation to tolerate, and more retaliation generates more informative signals (in the Blackwell sense) about the agent’s effort. Second, given the information acquired, the principal designs the optimal payment schemes, which pool moderately (potentially all) bad agent performances with the uninformative signal realization. The empirical literature documents that supervisors are reluctant to provide poor ratings and that performance reports are often inflated and compressed. We show that such a pattern in performance appraisals can arise as firms’ optimal responses to retaliation concerns.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01226 .</content>

    <title>What Makes Consumption Experiences Feel Special? A Multi-Method Integrative Analysis</title>
    <updated>2025-06-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article addresses a simple theoretical question of high substantive relevance: What makes a consumption experience special in a consumer’s mind? To answer this question, the authors report an extensive multi-method investigation involving a grounded theory analysis of numerous consumer narratives and in-depth interviews, a field survey, a scale development study, a natural language processing analysis of more than 3 million Yelp reviews, a preregistered multi-factor causal experiment (and its preregistered replication), a blind comparison of hundreds of matched visual Instagram posts by third-party observers, and several small application studies. The findings converge in identifying three major psychological pillars of what makes consumption experiences feel special to consumers, each pillar involving different facets: (a) uniqueness, which arises from the rarity, novelty, irreproducibility, personalization, exclusivity, ephemerality, and surpassing of expectations of the experience; (b) meaningfulness, which pertains to the personal significance of the experience in terms of symbolism, relationships, self-affirmation, and self-transformation; and (c) authenticity, which relates to the perceived genuineness and realness of the experience in terms of its psychological proximity to some original source, iconicity, human sincerity, and connection to nature. As illustrated in the General Discussion, the findings have important substantive implications for the engineering of hedonic consumption experiences.</content>

    <title>You Get What You Pay For! An Economic Analysis of the Impact of Data Sponsorship on Content Production</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractThe pricing strategies employed by internet service providers (ISPs), such as AT&amp;T, can significantly influence the decisions of content creators—like video streaming platforms or app developers—regarding the types of content they offer. One such strategy is “sponsored data,” where content providers pay ISPs so that users can access their content without using their own data allowances. This study examines the effects of data sponsorship on content quality, company profits, and consumer benefits. Our analysis reveals that the efficiency of content providers in producing high-quality content is a critical factor. When creating high-quality content is difficult or expensive, sponsored data allows ISPs to increase their profits but can harm content providers by driving overly aggressive competition for users. Conversely, when producing high-quality content becomes easier or less costly—such as with the support of artificial intelligence—sponsored data can benefit both content providers and consumers, albeit at the expense of ISP profits. As advancements in technology continue to facilitate content creation, ISPs and policymakers must reconsider the structure of data sponsorship programs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We discuss how to estimate the interplay between genes (nature) and environments (nurture), with an empirical illustration of the moderating effect of school starting age on one’s genetic predisposition towards educational attainment. We argue that gene–environment (G×E) studies can be instrumental for (i) assessing treatment effect heterogeneity, (ii) testing theoretical predictions, and (iii) uncovering mechanisms, thereby improving understanding of how (policy) interventions affect population subgroups. Empirically, we find that being old-for-grade and having a higher genetic propensity for education benefits children on assessment tests as they progress through school. In this setting, families appear to increase genetic inequalities while schools seem to reduce them.</content>

    <title>Surviving Childhood: Effects of Removing a Child from Home</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the effects of the court-ordered removal of children from home on health, crime, and education. To isolate causal effects, I exploit quasi-random variation in judge assignment together with across-judge variation in the tendency to favor removal in an instrumental variable (IV) design. Using a novel data set (N=26,579) based on Swedish court documents that I transcribe and link with detailed register data, I find that court-ordered out-of-home placement has large adverse effects on the mortality of the marginal child. These effects are primarily driven by suicides that occur while the removed child is still placed in out-of-home care. Removal also causes an increase in hospitalizations for mental illness and non-narcotic crimes. There is little evidence of adverse health effects for birth parents. I explore potential explanations for the detrimental effects on child health. Adverse care conditions and peer exposure appear to be important channels.</content>

    <title>On the Optimality of Affine Decision Rules in Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose conditions under which two-stage distributionally robust optimization problems are optimally solved in affine or K-adaptable affine decision rules. Contrary to previous work, our conditions do not impose any structure on the support of the uncertain parameters, and they ensure pointwise (as opposed to worst case) optimality of (K-adaptable) affine decision rules. The absence of support restrictions allows us to transfer nonlinearities from the problem description to the support via liftings, whereas the pointwise optimality implies that decision rules remain optimal for broad classes of distributionally robust optimization problems, including data-driven problems over [Formula: see text]-divergence or Wasserstein ambiguity sets. We demonstrate how our conditions can be met in two applications.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization and decision analytics.Funding: This work was supported by Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [Grant EP/W003317/1].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00053 .</content>

    <title>Learning More Than You Can Know: Introductory Education Produces Overly Expansive Self-Assessments of Knowledge</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Education is a primary engine for gaining knowledge, yet it is unclear if introductory education helps learners gain meta-knowledge, that is, an accurate awareness of the scope and limits of their knowledge. We found that after taking an introductory finance class, relative to a control class, students overclaimed more knowledge they did not have, that is, endorsed more familiarity with bogus finance terms and expressed more confidence under incentives in their ability to answer questions about these terms. This finding was replicated in a Psychology and Law class, compared with a control class, with overclaiming still elevated two years later. In two follow-up experiments, participants in a hypothetical consulting context were randomly assigned to introductory training on GPS or a control topic. Participants in the GPS condition overclaimed more knowledge of bogus GPS terms and were more confident in their knowledge of real material never covered in the training, controlling for test performance. These effects were explained by introductory education both increasing self-perceived expertise in the education domain and creating basic schematic understanding that accommodates plausible but incorrect interpretations of unknown content. Introductory education, then, does not necessarily improve learners’ skills at identifying lack of knowledge. Rather, it can lead to an illusion of knowledge for unknown material, causing learners to overestimate their “circle of competence.”This paper was accepted by George Wu, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported in part by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education at the University of Wisconsin–Madison with funding from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, awarded to S.

    <title>Hiring as Exploration</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article views hiring as a contextual bandit problem: to find the best workers over time, firms must balance “exploitation” (selecting from groups with proven track records) with “exploration” (selecting from under-represented groups to learn about quality). Yet modern hiring algorithms, based on supervised learning approaches, are designed solely for exploitation. Instead, we build a resume screening algorithm that values exploration by evaluating candidates according to their statistical upside potential. Using data from professional services recruiting within a Fortune 500 firm, we show that this approach improves the quality (as measured by eventual hiring rates) of candidates selected for an interview, while also increasing demographic diversity, relative to the firm’s existing practices. The same is not true for traditional supervised learning-based algorithms, which improve hiring rates but select far fewer Black and Hispanic applicants. Together, our results highlight the importance of incorporating exploration in developing decision-making algorithms that are potentially both more efficient and equitable.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether variation in regulatory leniency is associated with the cost of deposits in the banking industry. We predict that lenient regulatory supervision allows for greater bank risk-taking due to delayed intervention, resulting in a higher cost of deposits. Our main finding is a positive association between banks’ cost of uninsured deposits and the leniency of their state regulators, incremental to observable measures of risk and performance. We further show that this result is stronger for riskier banks and when uninsured depositors have a greater ability or incentive to influence deposit rates. These findings suggest that the leniency of bank regulators is priced in uninsured deposit rates and further our understanding of the factors associated with regulatory leniency in the banking industry.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Synergy in Counter-terrorism: Airstrikes, Ground Attacks &amp;amp; Civilian Evacuations in Diverse Topologies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over the past two decades, there has been a rise in localized terrorist organizations that have seized control of geographical regions, leading to intricate spatial topological relations between areas controlled by terrorists and those populated by civilians. Given the complexity and duration of counter-terrorism operations, governments must continually adapt their strategies to defeat terrorists in diverse geographical configurations. These operations can be protracted and expensive, with numerous factors influencing their success. We develop a framework to investigate four spatial topological relations: no overlap between opposing forces, partial overlap, government-controlled regions within terrorist-held areas, and terrorist-controlled regions within government-controlled areas. We determine whether government forces should start strikes and, if so, analyze the allocation of resources between airstrikes and ground operations. Additionally, we assess the maximum acceptable level of civilian casualties resulting from mistaken airstrikes. Further, using an evolutionary game, we conduct an equilibrium analysis of disruptive technologies and strategies—such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) used by governments and the deployment of homemade rockets and bluffing tactics by terrorists—in long-term operations, examining their impact on government strike decisions. Our findings show that achieving complete success requires carefully chosen airstrike- or ground-oriented counter-terrorism operations based on their comparative advantages, while avoiding over-concentration or excessive averaging in resource allocation. In conclusion, our parsimonious framework and associated results contribute to informed optimal decision-making in counter-terrorism operations, taking into account the tradeoff between the strike resources and the disruptive offensive-defensive measures within various geographical relations between opposing forces.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Seruproduction systems have demonstrated excellent rapid response capabilities in both stable and uncertain environments. This study reveals that when compared to the Toyota Production System, theseruproduction method improves rapid response capabilities by 20% and 50% in stable and uncertain environments, respectively. The underlying reasons for this improvement were unclear, so this became a focus of this paper. Static and dynamic Just-In-Time Organization Systems are used to investigate both the flexibility and efficiency ofseruproduction systems under stable and uncertain conditions. Findings show that the rapid response capability of aserusystem is driven by the substitution effect of parallel serus. Efficiency is relatively easy to achieve in stable environments but is more challenging in unstable conditions. Therefore, this study explored methods to achieve high efficiency inserusystems under uncertain environments. A stochastic gradient algorithm and a dynamic allocation algorithm are proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform traditional newsvendor models and can achieve near-optimal performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greater Price Stability Without Sacrificing Optimal Revenue GuaranteesIn today’s digital marketplaces, sellers often rely on dynamic pricing—changing prices frequently—to optimize revenue. However, frequent price changes can undermine customer trust. In a new study published in Operations Research, researchers from the U.S. Naval Academy, MIT Sloan, and the University of Illinois at Chicago demonstrate that it is possible to restrict price changes to only decrease over time—through strategic markdowns—while still achieving strong performance guarantees. Their research shows that optimizing pricing trajectories, even under monotonicity constraints, does not compromise optimal regret guarantees for maximizing revenue. This finding challenges the prevailing assumption that taming price experimentation may hinder success. The work opens new avenues for how online platforms can rethink pricing strategies to foster consumer loyalty without sacrificing profitability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the daunting societal and financial impacts of the opioid crisis, extant research offers only a partial understanding of it, particularly regarding the role of healthcare policy. Accordingly, grounded in institutional theory, we examined how a policy that monitors and financially incentivizes patient satisfaction with pain management during a hospital stay affected opioid prescribing behavior of frontline workers (i.e., prescribers). Leveraging 43 months of opioid prescribing data, our research reveals that the introduction of such a policy is associated with higher opioid prescribing intensity. Furthermore, our results reveal that the policy's unintended consequences were intensified under high levels of prescribing workload and market competition. These findings augment the understanding of the negative impacts of the former and unveil an unfavorable corollary to the positive impacts of the latter. We complemented these results with a qualitative study that revealed the presence of coercive, mimetic, and normative pressures and the influence of prescribing workload and market competition in the prescribing context, instilling confidence in our theorizing, results, and contributions. Our study culminates in prescriptive implications for policymakers, prescribers, and healthcare leaders.</content>

    <title>The Double‐Edged‐Sword Effect of Constant Connectivity on Work Performance: Roles of Perceived Value, Work–Life Balance, and Work–Family Conflict</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Constant connectivity through smartphone use represents a major societal challenge, particularly in relation to work performance and work–nonwork boundaries. This research leverages an interdisciplinary theoretical framework, crisis settings, and a cross‐cultural approach (France and the United Kingdom) to specify the impacts of smartphone use on work performance and work–life interfaces, before and during the COVID‐19 crisis, among large samples of employees (NPilot= 229; N1= 938; N2= 1042). An empirical test of this integrative model shows that smartphone use influences work performance directly, work–life balance negatively mediates this relationship, and work–family conflict moderates it. It advances knowledge by considering both dimensions of work performance, generic task performance and adaptive performance, which is crucial for adapting to technologies and crises. This research also emphasizes the need to consider the context in which smartphone use affects work performance, notably in situations marked by high pressure, such as crises that become chronic. By introducing the marketing concept of perceived value as a mediator, this research shows that utilitarian value improves work performance while hedonic value decreases it, thus advancing the scholarly conversation and helping to manage constant connectivity.</content>

    <title>The Six Dimensions of Strong Theory</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One of the most important features on which to judge the merit of any academic paper is the strength of its theory. Although commentary about what constitutes strong theory is widespread, there is no holistic account of the full range of existing perspectives. To address this oversight, I construct a typology composed of six dimensions of strong theory: importance, interestingness, actionability, generality, simplicity, and accuracy. This typology provides a lens to examine a vexing problem: the effort to increase the strength of a theory on one dimension will usually compromise its strength on others. Despite this reality, authors experience pressure in the review process to optimize theories on all six dimensions. I explain how the expectation to build theories that cannot possibly be built (what I call the fruitless search for unicorn theories) is driven by historical forces. The study of organizations emerged not from one source but from a half-dozen distinct traditions, including applied scientists who study time-sensitive problems, disciplinary scholars who identify universal laws of human behavior, and empiricists who prefer a tight link between concepts and measures. Review teams are often composed of referees who hail from different traditions and possess divergent views on theory. Even when each reviewer has concerns that are reasonable in isolation, authors often confront unrealistic expectations when reviewers’ preferences are aggregated. To mitigate this problem, I recommend that authors, reviewers, and editors (1) prioritize fewer dimensions in any single theory and (2) emphasize distinct dimensions in different theories on the same topic.</content>

    <title>When Great Powers Struggle: How Geopolitical Alignments of Small States Are Influenced by Their &lt;scp&gt;MNEs&lt;/scp&gt;</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Comparing two distinct deglobalization periods, this study shows how Finnish multinational enterprises (MNEs) used corporate diplomatic activities (CDA) to influence Finland's alignment with a struggling great power. Drawing from hegemonic stability theory and new institutional economics, we argue that the power's collapsing global networks and institutions exposed Finnish MNEs to cross‐border constraints typical of small states – reliant on but unable to govern the rules set by great powers. We identify two distinct CDA responses aimed at sustaining cross‐border activities: in one period, Finnish shipbuilding MNEs adopted a defensive approach to maintain alignment with the struggling power; in the other, Finnish paper MNEs pursued an explorative strategy to reposition Finland toward alternative powers. Informal institutions at home explain these divergent responses: they either discredited or legitimized existing geopolitical alignments. These CDA mechanisms produced contrasting outcomes: shipbuilders' defensive stance drove de‐internationalization after the collapse of the great power's global networks and institutions, while the paper MNEs' explorative strategy turned shifting geopolitics into an opportunity for renewed internationalization. By showing how MNEs influence diplomatic processes between their ‘small’ home country and great powers, we call on management scholars to take more seriously structural power asymmetries that shape global politics that constrain MNE behaviour during periods of geopolitical instability.</content>

    <title>Space: a new frontier for international business</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article examines (outer) Space as a new frontier for international business (IB) and highlights the unique challenges and opportunities it presents. Unlike terrestrial business environments, Space is characterized by extreme physical conditions, ambiguous property rights, and an institutional vacuum, which disrupt conventional IB theories. The study identifies three key challenges—congestion, contention, and competition—arising from the commercialization of Space and the increasing presence of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in the sector. Utilizing the OLI (ownership, location, internalization) framework, the paper critically reassesses existing IB theories, considering these Space-specific complexities and their long-term implications for global business strategy. Furthermore, it explores the geopolitical and regulatory implications of Space activities, arguing that the absence of effective governance structures necessitates novel policy frameworks and cooperative mechanisms to ensure responsible expansion. The study also underscores the role of MNEs in shaping sustainable Space commercialization, proposing the addition of a new 18th Sustainable Development Goal—Sustainable Space. The findings contribute to IB scholarship by advancing theoretical approaches that account for the spatial, institutional, and competitive dynamics unique to (outer) Space, offering a foundation for future research, policy development, and industry collaboration in the era of Space-based business and security expansion.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study repeated games with anonymous random matching where players can add or remove signals from their records. The ability to manipulate records introduces monotonicity constraints on players’ continuation values, under which sufficiently long-lived players will almost never cooperate. When players’ expected lifespans are intermediate, their ability to sustain cooperation depends on (i) whether their actions are complements or substitutes and (ii) whether manipulation takes the form of adding or removing signals.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: From Growth to Monetization: Managing Freemium Services</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the recent rapid growths of freemium services, we study freemium service providers’ dynamic operating policies to maximize their lifetime profits. We adopt a hybrid of the Bass diffusion model and the replicator equation from evolutionary game theory to capture the user base growth, and model the provider’s dynamic decisions as an optimal control problem. We analyze two variants of the freemium business model inspired by two prominent examples, Dropbox and Spotify, which respectively adopt the monetization strategies of limiting features and advertising (and its removal). We establish the optimal dynamic operating policies for the Dropbox-inspired ad-free freemium model and the Spotify-inspired ad-supported freemium model and identify their distinctive operational characteristics: the optimal policies as well as the sustainability of the Dropbox model critically depend on the network effect among users, whereas the optimal policies of the Spotify model show that advertising could be a more effective monetization strategy than limiting features. The latter observation is confirmed in a general model allowing both monetization strategies where the optimal policies consistently adopt advertising without limiting features. We then show that the freemium model significantly outperforms the ad-supported free model in weak advertising markets and that offering multiple tiers of premium subscription is unnecessary and confirm our core insights’ robustness under a generalized network effect, customized advertisements, and liquidity constraints. Our study establishes the versatility and value of the freemium model to suit distinct needs of a service in different stages from growth to monetization, and provides guidelines for service providers adopting this business model.</content>

    <title>Taking Turns Leading? Rotational Leadership in New Product Development Projects With Supplier Involvement</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the potential value of involving suppliers in buyers' new product development (NPD) projects, there are challenges in integrating distributed resources and actions across organizational boundaries. Insight from theintra‐organizational leadership literature suggests that an effectiveinter‐organizational leadership model could help address project‐level coordination challenges. Adopting an agency theory view complemented by role theory, this study examines the antecedents and outcomes of rotational leadership (i.e., shifting leadership roles in a process) in a buyer NPD project involving suppliers. The results indicate a U‐shaped relationship between rotational leadership and project performance by analyzing a paired sample of quantitative and qualitative data for 279 NPD projects. In a post hoc qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), this study triangulates quantitative results using interview data, showing that buyers adopt boundary buffering to address potential rotational leadership risks while achieving high project performance. Both buyer risk‐taking and supplier relationship‐specific investments contribute to the emergence of rotational leadership. These results enrich supplier involvement in the NPD literature by demonstrating (1) when rotational leadership emerges and (2) how it affects project performance. The findings also provide managerial implications for leadership role arrangements and boundary‐buffering decisions in the context of collaborative innovation in the supply chain.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Customers’ Review Content and Their Referral and (Re)Purchase Behaviors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research examines how customer review content influences review writers’ subsequent decisions. Employing a mixed-methods approach, including a field experiment, a scenario experiment, and archival data analysis, the authors investigated the effects of affective content, cognitive content, and length of customers’ reviews on their subsequent referral and (re)purchase behaviors across various contexts, such as household services, podcast trials, and airline services. The authors leveraged the random assignment of experimental interventions and other shifters to induce exogenous variation in review content features. Additionally, they employed instrumental and proxy variables to address endogeneity issues. Findings from the three studies consistently demonstrate that affective content in reviews enhances referral and repurchase behaviors, whereas cognitive content exerts adverse effects. Moderation analyses show that the effects of review length on these behavioral outcomes depend on individual and contextual factors that affect customers’ elaboration likelihood during review writing. Overall, this research provides actionable insights for strategically shaping customer review content to drive critical business outcomes and enriches theoretical understanding of how content features of customer reviews affect review writers’ decisions.</content>

    <title>The Effects of Competition and Scarcity on Interpersonal Communication in Organizations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When an organization’s environment changes, communication between its members is essential for a timely response. However, past observational studies suggest that communication declines when an organization is exposed to an adverse environmental event. To understand why this might happen, I examine the effects of competition and scarcity—two common features of adverse events—on information sharing and seeking—the microfoundations of organizational communication. In the present study, interactive groups of experimental participants play a novel n-armed bandit game where they work as salespeople for companies that offer a lot of different products (The Sales Game). Some groups experience stable customer demand, while others are exposed to negative or positive demand shifts. Participants earn variable rewards based on their individual performance, and competition is induced in half of the groups through a small bonus based on relative performance. Participants can choose to exchange information with their peers throughout the task. When participants freely exchange information, the increase in individual performance-based rewards is larger than the tiny competitive bonus. But, participants exposed to this competition share information significantly less often than those who are not. This produces a pattern of communication network contraction consistent with prior observational studies of organizations exposed to adverse events. In contrast to prior research, scarcity (negative demand shifts) has no effect on information exchange. These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between competition, scarcity, and interpersonal communication in organizations. They also have important implications for the design of incentive schemes in modern firms.Funding: This research was supported by funds from the Chicago Booth Graduate School of Business and the Division of Social and Economic Sciences [Grant 2018173].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18288 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Large, generalist, technology firms—so-called “big-tech” firms—powerful in their primary market, routinely enter secondary markets consisting of specialist firms. Naturally, one might expect a specialist firm to be fiercely protective of its data as a way to maintain its market position in the secondary market. Counter to this intuition, we demonstrate that a specialist firm willingly shares its market data with an intruding generalist. We do so by developing a model of cross-market competition in which the data collected via consumer usage in one market can improve product quality in another. We show that a specialist firm shares its data to strategically create codependence between the two firms, thereby softening competition and transforming the generalist firm from a traditional competitor into a coopetitor. For the generalist intruder, data from the specialist firm substitute for its own investments in product quality in the secondary market. As such, the act of sharing data makes the generalist a stakeholder in the data collected by the specialist, and consequently in the specialist’s continued success. Moreover, although the firms benefit from data sharing, consumers can be worse off from weakened price competition and lower investments in innovation. Our results have managerial and policy implications, notably on account of backlash against data collection and the market power of big-tech firms.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, information systems.Funding: D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Indigenous communities are resurging and harnessing this momentum to reshape their social world. As they reclaim their cultural resources, rights, and identities, they gain control over how and whether to engage with Western social structures. Using the metaphor ofmetal frameandgrass basketmaterials, we conceptualize how First Nations communities mobilize scaffolding materials from different social realities and innovatively combine them to shape and reshape their social world. We theorize that the degree to which a community integrates different scaffolding materials is consequential for whether and how the community will engage with outsiders. We learn from First Nations communities across northernTurtle Island(Canada) by running a cluster analysis and identifying three different ways communities construct scaffolding using Indigenous and Western materials. Then, using a unique dataset of 240 Canadian First Nations communities, we use those clusters to predict the likelihood a given community will engage in a partnership agreement with an outsider, in this case a non‐Indigenous mining company, and when they might do so. This analysis highlights a kind of entrepreneurial activity, the construction and use of scaffolding, and a context that is overlooked by mainstream entrepreneurship scholars and management scholars in general. We aim to contribute to the recalibration of entrepreneurship literature through a decolonial lens.</content>

    <title>Content Provision on UGC Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers visiting platforms that host user-generated content (UGC) not only consume content but also generate content by investing time and effort. This paper seeks to examine a UGC platform’s content provision strategy: how a UGC platform can motivate consumers to generate UGC and how it can manage the balance between UGC and the platform’s own content. As UGC and the platform’s own content perform the same function, one may be inclined to think that the two types of content are substitutes. Our analysis shows that they could function as strategic complements. This is because increasing the platform’s own content provision raises the quality of content on the platform, motivates more consumers to join the platform, and increases the total UGC provision on the platform. The public good characteristics of UGC could prompt us to think that UGC provision on the platform will be less than the socially optimal level. Our analysis identifies conditions when the total provision of UGC can be more than the social optimum. One may wonder whether it is profitable for a UGC platform to completely dispense with its own content. We find that it is always profitable for the UGC platform to offer some of its own content. This is because when consumers spend more time consuming the content, the platform can monetize their attention and earn higher ad revenue. Additionally, we find that an increase in ad space on the platform may motivate greater provision of UGC. Finally, we extend the model in several different directions and find that our results are robust.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: W.

    <title>Governing Within Semirigid Limits: Navigating the Centralization–Decentralization Paradox in Blockchain‐Based Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Blockchain‐based platforms can facilitate data sharing and coordination in interorganizational ecosystems by enabling secure, tamper‐evident recordkeeping and streamlined, trust‐minimized transactions across organizational boundaries. However, their decentralized architecture may conflict with the centralized control exercised by platform sponsors, giving rise to a centralization–decentralization paradox. This study explores how this paradox unfolds in a large, blockchain‐based logistics platform that was ultimately discontinued. Through an in‐depth, longitudinal case study, we identify three interrelated governance contradictions—regarding ownership, trust, and growth—that triggered destabilizing oscillations between centralized and decentralized governance modes. We introduce the concept ofsemirigid limitsto capture the bounded flexibility within which governance can be made and adapted under such paradoxical conditions. Our findings show that the centralization–decentralization paradox is especially difficult to navigate when strategic boundary conditions—here, industry competition, fragmented coordination, and high interdependencies—are present. Our study contributes to the paradox and governance literature by theorizing how governance contradictions emerge and persist and by identifying the mechanisms that constrain alignment and adaptation. We also offer guidance for managers in regard to addressing the competing demands of centralization and decentralization in interorganizational platforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Religion plays an important role in the lives of many individuals across the world, influencing various aspects of their lives. One area where the impact of religion is observed—but underexplored—is in consumer behavior. Research on the role of religion in consumer behavior is still developing, and we propose that focusing on religious values offers a promising direction for advancing this area of research. In this paper, we review existing research on values associated with religion and their influence on a wide range of consumer behavior, using Schwartz's values theory and the moral foundations theory as frameworks. But we also seek to build on these frameworks, and we conclude by suggesting potential avenues for future research on relationships between religious values and consumer behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Aglozo and Cohen (Journal of Consumer Psychology, 2025) synthesize prior work on the influence of religious values on consumer behavior through the frameworks of Schwartz's value theory and moral foundations theory. In this commentary, we extend their work by examining the intersection of religious values and branding. First, we build upon existing frameworks to identify pathways through which brands can leverage religious values (people‐based associations, place‐based associations, brand network associations, and activity‐based associations), while also noting important downsides. Second, we discuss how context affects the extent to which consumers behave according to their religious values, focusing on three mechanisms: identity salience, value internalization and framing, and competing consumption values. Finally, we conclude with directions for future work on religious values in consumer research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how stock index inclusion affects corporate financing using a global sample of 198 index events—primarily new index launches—across 21 markets. Firms added to indexes issue more public debt but not equity, leading to a sustained increase in leverage. Inclusion draws greater attention from analysts and the media and increases the likelihood of receiving credit ratings. As a result, indexed firms benefit from more liquid bond markets and lower yield spreads, prompting greater reliance on public debt. Consistent with an information‐driven mechanism, leverage responses are strongest in countries with weaker information environments. However, these information gains do not enhance stock price informativeness: bid‐ask spreads, price impact measures, post‐earnings announcement drift, and the implied cost of equity remain unchanged—likely because of the growing presence of information‐insensitive passive investors.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managers prioritize favorable analysts during earnings calls, reinforcing analysts’ incentives for optimism. However, managers also frequently interact with unfavorable analysts, and this study examines the determinants and benefits of these interactions. I find that managers interact more with unfavorable analysts when compelled to do so. I then examine two likely benefits of these interactions. First, unfavorable analysts attenuate their negative views after interacting with managers. Second, price reactions to management forecasts are stronger for managers who regularly interact with unfavorable analysts, consistent with enhanced reporting credibility. Finally, using peer firm restatements as exogenous shocks to investors’ perceptions of accounting quality, I find that nonrestating firms with managers who regularly interact with unfavorable analysts experience attenuated negative returns relative to other nonrestating peers. Overall, the empirical evidence indicates firms experience significant benefits when managers interact with unfavorable analysts and these benefits persist amongst compelled and voluntary interactions.</content>

    <title>Employer Responsiveness to Online Reviews: A Signal of Caring About Employees</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employer reviews (i.e., online workplace ratings authored by employees) attract broad interest and shape the opinions of potential employees. Thus, companies face the challenge of dealing with these workplace judgments that are outside their direct control. While prevailing theoretical perspectives suggest that responding to third‐party judgments may be an effective way for companies to deal with them, they focus on responses to negative judgments that threaten companies' reputations. Based on signaling theory, we argue that employer responsiveness, signaled by an employer's first response to an employer review, serves as a mechanism of indirect control over employer reviews. Applying a difference‐in‐differences approach—a statistical technique to estimate the causal effect of the treatment (i.e., responsiveness) by comparing it to a control group without the treatment—on a sample of 298,269 reviews of 21,099 employers over 45 quarters posted on the employer review website Kununu, we hypothesize and find that compared to nonresponsive employers, responsive employers receive more diverse (i.e., variety of topics covered) and extensive (i.e., amount of information provided) employer reviews. These effects are especially pronounced in the case of negative employer reviews. Our findings can serve as a guide for employers in dealing with third‐party judgments by demonstrating that employer responsiveness is a valuable signal enhancing online review quality. We contribute to the growing body of HRM research on employer reputation on social media, a critical factor influencing recruitment and retention outcomes. Our study opens new avenues for research to explore the role of responsiveness as a strategic signal in employer brand management.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Smarter Load Balancing with Fewer MessagesModern data centers rely on real-time information to route jobs efficiently—but constant communication between servers and load balancers can overwhelm the network. In their paper, “Load Balancing Using Sparse Communication,” Gal Mendelson and Kuang Xu present a breakthrough: high-performance load balancing using drastically fewer messages. They introduce a flexible framework based on state approximation and develop new algorithms and communication protocols that maintain near-optimal performance even when communication is sparse. The key insight is that servers can monitor how wrong the load balancer’s estimate is and communicate only when necessary. Their approach reduces communication by over 90% while sacrificing little quality, as proven through both theory and simulation. These results offer a scalable and practical solution for large service systems where bandwidth is precious.</content>

    <title>Career Success and Minority Status: A Review and Conceptual Framework</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, the management field has witnessed a surge in studies examining career success among workers from historically marginalized minority groups. However, to date, insights gained from this research remain fragmented and have not been integrated into the existing career success frameworks. We aim to complement career success scholarship and contribute to its inclusivity by conducting a systematic review that synthesizes the factors and pathways contributing to the career success of four historically underrepresented minority groups: women, racial and ethnic minorities, individuals with disabilities, and the LGBTQ+ community. Evidencing that career success disparity can be attributed to minority status, we propose a framework that highlights the career advancement and human and psychological resources associated with minority groups’ career success, as well as the systemic barriers limiting access to and use of such resources. We suggest hypervisibility, invisibility, and managed visibility as distinguishable forms of identity-based mechanisms that offer theoretical explanations for the influence of marginalized identity status on career success. Our framework integrates manifestations of subjective career success—accounting for survival, the collective good, and adjustability in addition to what extant literature has shown—emphasizing that membership in marginalized groups, communities, and other identity-relevant contexts shapes the subjective meaning of career success. Our review has practical implications for decision makers and organizations intending to bridge minority and nonminority groups’ career success disparity.</content>

    <title>The Unexpected Upside of High Language Diversity: Social Integration Through Language Advice Networks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While the corporate lingua franca mandate aims to facilitate communications among linguistically diverse employees, evidence shows that it creates more problems than it solves, often negatively affecting social integration and knowledge sharing in the workplace. Our study is driven by the phenomenon of high language diversity and low lingua franca proficiency, emerging characteristics of workplaces around the globe given increasing migration. We adopt a mixed-methods, longitudinal design involving participant observations, interviews, social network surveys, and company data. Our analysis revealed the existence and prevalence of an informal language advice network (LAN) in which individuals with varying levels of English proficiency actively engage in voluntary language-related knowledge-seeking and sharing. We found more positive interpersonal interactions and consequences of LAN than typically reported in extant studies. We leverage the social networks and generalized exchange literature to explain the processes and consequences of LAN for individuals and the organization. Management recognition was found to be important for sustaining LAN in a context of high language diversity. Our integrative analytical framework offers a valuable lens for scholarship on future workplaces that are being shaped by rapidly shifting ethnic, cultural, and linguistic demography.</content>

    <title>The effects of government debt on corporate borrowing in developing economies: evidence from Africa</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many African economies face high debt levels, yet local firms have unique growth opportunities requiring external financing. We examine whether government borrowing constrains corporate financing in Africa and how these effects differ by debt source. Using a manually collected dataset from 29 African countries (2000–2019), we uncover financing patterns that challenge conventional theories. In sharp contrast to firms in developed markets, we find that African firms experience a “crowding-in” effect when governments borrow externally, enhancing their access to debt. In contrast, domestic government borrowing induces the typical crowding-out effect, where government borrowing reduces corporate access to debt. The crowding-in phenomenon is most evident among publicly listed firms, particularly those cross-listed on foreign exchanges (the multinationals). The effect strengthens in countries with higher Eurobond market activity and intensifies following sovereign credit downgrades, underscoring the sovereign ceiling’s constraint on corporate borrowing. Our findings contribute significantly to international business literature by revealing how African debt markets function differently, highlighting unique financing challenges faced by African multinational enterprises, and demonstrating that economic principles established in developed markets cannot be universally applied to emerging economies. These insights are crucial for designing effective policies to support corporate growth in Africa.</content>

    <title>Fleet Repositioning for Vehicle Sharing Systems: Asymptotic Optimality of the Balanced Myopic Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the fleet repositioning problem aimed at dynamically optimizing vehicle distributions to maximize long-run average social welfare in a vehicle-sharing system. We model the problem as a Markov decision process under theex antecommitted decision scheme, characterizing the balanced myopic policy as optimal for the average reward setting. This policy efficiently aligns vehicle supply with trip demand and mitigates the curse of dimensionality, enhancing computational efficiency significantly. Our analysis demonstrates that although the balanced myopic policy operates with less information, potentially leading to performance losses, the maximum performance gap relative to theex postdecision scheme asymptotically converges to zero as the system size increases. This finding underscores the asymptotic optimality of the balanced myopic policy, particularly in large systems, making it a robust and effective solution for fleet repositioning. Moreover, we extend our investigation to settings with seasonal demand, confirming that a generalized balanced myopic policy remains optimal. Through comprehensive numerical experiments and a counterfactual case study of a real-world vehicle-sharing system, we quantify the operational value of our approach. This study not only validates the balanced myopic policy against more information-intensive solutions but also illuminates effective heuristic design strategies for improving the efficiency of fleet repositioning in vehicle sharing systems.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Horizontal Consolidation in Healthcare Markets: Can Performance Incentives Preserve Access to Care?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects of hospital consolidations on access to care in a competitive healthcare market in the presence of performance incentives. We consider a transition from a “pre-merger” market configuration where a payer delegates services to a market with two competing hospitals to a “horizontally consolidated” configuration under which the same entity manages two hospitals. We focus on two research questions: How should the payer set access-based performance incentives in response to a horizontal market consolidation? What are the effects of consolidation on patient access to care? We use queueing dynamics to describe patient care processes and analyze the strategic interactions between hospitals and the optimal design of performance-based incentives in different market configurations. Specifically, we consider contracts where hospital compensation for delivering care includes a combination of fee-for-service payments and bonus components tied to the level of access to care patients receive. We derive the optimal bonus-type contracts that the payer can use to adapt to changes in market concentration, and we quantify the resulting impact on patient access to care and social welfare. In our analysis, we consider two alternative settings: the “fixed- FFS” setting, where the fee-for-service component cannot be altered, and the “flexible-FFS” setting, where both the fee-for-service and the bonus components can be adjusted in response to changes in the market composition. Our analysis shows that the bonus-type performance incentives provide payer with the ability to protect patient access to care upon hospital consolidation in a wide range of problem settings, provided that the intensity of competition between the hospitals is sufficiently strong. If, otherwise, the intensity of competition is relatively weak, horizontal consolidation may compromise access to care.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: An Adaptive Optimization Approach to Personalized Financial Incentives in Behavioral Interventions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Obesity is a critical healthcare issue affecting the United States. The least risky treatments available for obesity are behavioral interventions meant to promote diet and exercise. Often these interventions contain a mobile component that allows interventionists to collect participants level data and provide participants with incentives and goals to promote long term behavioral change. Recently, there has been interest in using direct financial incentives to promote behavior change. However, adherence is challenging in these interventions, as each participant will react differently to different incentive structure and amounts, leading researchers to consider personalized interventions. The key challenge for personalization, is that the clinicians do not know a priori how best to administer incentives to participants, and given finite intervention budgets how to disburse costly resources efficiently. In this paper, we consider this challenge of designing personalized weight loss interventions that use direct financial incentives to motivate weight loss while remaining within a budget. We create a predictive model that is able to predict how individuals may react to different incentive schedules within the context of a behavioral intervention. We integrated this predictive model in an adaptive optimization framework that over the course of the intervention computes what incentives to disburse to participants and remain within the study budget. We show that our optimization framework is asymptotically optimal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using real world data from a real world weight loss trial that used financial incentives to incentives weight loss. Our results show that using an 60-80% smaller budget, our adaptive optimization framework is able to help the same number of participants lose weight as an existing one-size-fits-all intervention. Furthermore, using our adaptive optimization framework would spend only $120 per individual across 24 weeks as opposed to the current intervention which would spend $360 per individual in the same time frame to achieve similar clinical outcomes. Our results highlight that providers who choose to implement behavioral interventions at scale will need to use a personalized approach to effectively use their limited budgets.</content>

    <title>The Impact of Verbal and Visual Content on Consumer Engagement in Social Media Marketing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media marketing has been relentlessly developed and integrated into firm operations. On social media platforms, firms rely on a combination of verbal and visual elements to communicate with consumers and attract their attention. The present research investigates how the semantic relationship between text and image information affects consumer engagement (forwards and comments). Leveraging a large-scale dataset of firm-generated messages, we use deep learning, large language models, and topic models to quantify each text–image message with a theorized two-dimensional text–image incongruency (relevancy and expectancy).Relevancyis how closely the information aligns with the main message.Expectancyis how predictable or surprising the information is based on what people expect, which concerns long-term affective and cognitive memories about one's past and present experiences. We find that the interaction of relevancy and expectancy, two distinct dimensions at the cognitive level, is a crucial antecedent of consumer engagement on social media. High-relevancy–high-expectancy (HRHE) content and low-relevancy–low-expectancy (LRLE) content are the most effective strategies, whereas high-relevancy–low-expectancy (HRLE) and low-relevancy–high-expectancy (LRHE) contents do not work so well. Furthermore, this paper also uncovers the distinct nature of consumer engagement forms in social media settings, including forwards and comments. In particular, HRHE offers the exclusive benefit of boosting forwards while the two strategies are equally effective in eliciting comments. This research derives several important operational implications of consumer engagement and social media marketing by addressing the importance of multi-dimensional text–image incongruency and contributes to the literature on operations management and marketing interface.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Robust Data-Driven Design of a Smart Cardiac Arrest Response System</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the data-driven design of a smart emergency response system for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) that involves drones for automatic external defibrillator delivery and community responders alerted via a mobile application, in addition to ambulances. Our study is motivated by the widespread exploration of drones for delivery service, and the emergence of mobile applications that crowdsource community for emergency response. Based on a historical OHCA dataset with community responders’ response records from Singapore, we develop a robust joint deployment model of drone and ambulance to maximize the survivability of the response system while accounting for data uncertainty in OHCA occurrence and responder behavior. We discretize the planning area into finite demand regions, and allow different regions to have different OHCA demand rates, alert response probabilities and alert response time distributions from responders. Each of these attributes is only known to reside in an uncertainty/ambiguity set constructed from historical data. Our objective is to maximize the worst-case demand-weighted survival rate in the presence of uncertainty. We reformulate the resulting robust deployment model as a mixed-integer linear program, which can be efficiently solved by a proposed row-and-column generation algorithm with convergence guarantee. We illustrate our model and solution approach using real data from Singapore. We find that (i) hedging against uncertainty leads to a higher survival rate of the response system, compared to a sample average approximation deployment approach; (ii) while adding more drones/ambulances to the system exhibits diminishing return, a few drones are sufficient to increase the survival rate dramatically; and (iii) the impact of the behavior of responders on survival outcomes is more significant than that of simply adding drones/ambulances. We also discuss several managerial insights from the numerical experiments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the click and purchase behavior of customers in an online retail setting by employing a structural estimation approach. In particular, we aim to understand the impact of the information available to the customer before and after the click on the customer’s search and purchase behavior. We propose a sequential discrete choice framework to model the customer’s search strategy, where the customer repeatedly decides between continuing her search by clicking on a product, or stopping her search and making a purchase/no-purchase decision. By combining the click and order data, our proposed structural framework allows us todisentangleand separately estimate the attractiveness of a product before and after the click. This, in turn, allows us to identify underrated products which we calldiamonds in the rough: these are products that have low pre-click but high post-click attractiveness; thus, even though such products have a low chance of being clicked, they have a high chance of being purchased, if clicked. The proposed framework provides an online retailer with new tools and insights to better manage the product assortment based on customer click and purchase behavior. We estimate our model on a data set from the Chinese retailer JD.com. Through simulation studies, we illustrate how our model can be operationalized and used for improving assortment decisions by accounting for the customers’ search behavior. In particular, we focus on a subset of 126 substitutable products as a representative sample of the data and find that the optimal assortments under our model significantly increase the expected revenue compared to the actual assortments displayed by JD.com, and two multinomial logit (MNL) benchmarks.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Who Benefits from Government Tax-Subsidies for Corporate Charitable Food Donations?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leveraging government tax incentives to prompt corporate charitable giving has gained considerable popularity over the past decade. This paper sheds light on the broader consequences of the U.S. government’s tax-subsidy policy for charitable food donations, which is determined based on the fair market value (FMV) of the donated products. We incorporate the tax-subsidy into a monopolist food retailer’s after-tax profit function. Market demand is both price- and quality-dependent, and the shelf-life of the goods is determined by their initial quality and deterioration rate. The retailer makes joint quantity and pricing decisions over two periods, procuring goods at the start of the selling season and (possibly) donating at the end of period 1. We characterize the retailer’s optimal policy and specify conditions under which she donates some, all, or none of her leftover inventory. We explore the impact of government tax-subsidies on the retailer’s actions, consumer surplus, quantity of donations, and total welfare. We show that tax subsidies may motivate retailers to intentionally create supply scarcity (by donating more) to increase FMV (determined by the second-period price), thereby enhancing tax deductions. While tax subsidies encourage donations, they can also unintentionally harm consumers by reducing supply and raising prices. Interestingly, we show that a higher subsidy does not necessarily lead to more donations; the retailer may choose to donate fewer units to achieve the same tax deduction while increasing sales revenue. We investigate conditions under which tax subsidies can simultaneously increase donations, consumer surplus, and retail profit. We show that this outcome is possible only when retailers donate low-quality goods in modest quantities. Our findings reveal how FMV-dependent tax subsidies can backfire, reducing both consumer surplus and total welfare while benefiting the retailer. Governments must carefully weigh the benefits of donations against potential harm caused to consumers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Robotic mobile fulfillment (RMF) systems automate storage and transportation within fulfillment centers while still relying on human pickers. We focus on two key performance metrics in these systems, aiming to minimize overall completion time (OCT) as the primary objective and the number of required robots (NRR) as a secondary objective. We investigate two interrelated operational problems influencing these metrics:(i)pod selection, which involves choosing the mobile racks for item picking, and(ii)pod scheduling, which entails assigning these racks to pickers and determining the picking sequence. We first explore the pod scheduling problem independently, providing theoretical results. This stand-alone problem is NP-hard with at least two pickers when minimizing OCT and remains NP-hard with even one picker when minimizing NRR. The NRR objective introduces a novel optimization problem structure, contributing to scheduling theory even beyond the RMF context. We demonstrate that a simple but effective scheduling rule is asymptotically optimal for minimizing OCT with multiple pickers. For NRR minimization with a single picker, we derive theoretical performance bounds for two sequencing rules. When incorporating the pod selection problem, we focus on two approaches:(i)sequential and(ii)integrated pod selection and scheduling. The sequential approach handles pod selection first, then pod scheduling, while the integrated approach addresses both problems simultaneously within a single formulation to minimize OCT. Computational experiments using e-commerce order data reveal that the sequential approach achieves significantly faster and constant computation times, with a mean OCT similar to that of the integrated approach. We also find that our sequencing rules can reduce mean NRR by 13% to 28% without affecting OCT, compared to the case where no such rules are used. The sequential approach for OCT minimization and the proposed sequencing rules for NRR minimization are scalable to large systems with any picker count. Our experiments also explore the changes in OCT and NRR values with varying numbers of pickers. These results guide managers in assigning the desired number of pickers for a target OCT and inform managers about the average NRR they can expect for the chosen picker count.</content>

    <title>How Borrowers Respond to Dynamic Incentives? An Exploration of Repayment Decisions on Digital Credit</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how borrowers in digital credit markets respond to dynamic incentives. To this end, we leverage quasi-experimental variation in progressive lending policies to identify causal effects on repayment behavior. Our empirical strategy uncovers systematic heterogeneity in borrower responses across different stages of the borrower–lender relationship. We find that first-time borrowers who receive exogenously larger initial loans are significantly more likely to default—consistent with elevated moral hazard and increased repayment burden effects. In contrast, repeat borrowers who receive larger loan increments relative to their prior borrowing cycle exhibit substantially lower default rates. These contrasting patterns are consistent with a theoretical framework where experienced borrowers interpret loan size increases as credible signals of future credit expansion, thereby reinforcing their incentive to maintain repayment discipline. Supporting this mechanism, we document robust evidence of strategic repayment behavior, particularly among borrowers who advance rapidly through successive loan cycles. Collectively, our findings highlight the critical role of relationship dynamics in shaping borrower behavior and underscore the importance of tailoring progressive lending policies to a borrower’s experience level in order to enhance repayment outcomes across a diverse client base.This paper was accepted by Bruno Biais, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02016 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools based on Large Language Models (LLMs) are quickly reshaping how researchers conduct surveys and experiments. From reviewing the literature and designing instruments, to administering studies, coding data, and interpreting results, these tools offer substantial opportunities to improve research productivity and advance methodology. Yet with this potential comes a critical challenge: researchers often use these systems without fully understanding how they work. This article aims to provide a practical guide for effective and responsible GenAI use in primary research. We begin by explaining how GenAI systems operate, highlighting the gap between their intuitive interfaces and the underlying model architectures. We then examine different use cases throughout the research process, both the opportunities and associated risks at each stage. Throughout our review, we provide flexible tips for best practice and rules for effective and responsible GenAI use, particularly in areas pertaining to ensuring the validity of GenAI coded responses. In doing so, we hope to help researchers integrate GenAI into their workflows in a transparent, rigorous, and ethically sound manner. Our accompanying website (questionableresearch.ai) provides supporting materials, including reproducible coding templates in R and SPSS and sample pre-registrations.</content>

    <title>Extending the Turn to Work: New Directions in the Study of Social‐Symbolic Work in Organizational Life</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over the last two decades, a growing number of studies of novel forms of social‐symbolic work (e.g., identity work, boundary work, institutional work, values work, etc.) have appeared in the organization and management studies literature. This growing body of research – the ‘turn to work’ in organization theory – has provided important new insights into how actors purposefully participate in the social construction of organizations and their contexts. The aim of this special issue is to build on and extend these insights and in this introductory essay we begin by outlining a framework that provides a useful meta‐theory – the social‐symbolic work perspective – for integrating this stream of research. This perspective revolves around two key concepts: ‘social‐symbolic objects’ defined as meaningful patterns in a social system; and ‘social‐symbolic work’ defined as conscious, reflexive efforts to shape social‐symbolic objects. We then introduce the articles that appear in this special issue and identify important cross‐cutting themes. Drawing on these articles, we go on to identify potentially fruitful areas for future research on social‐symbolic work and end with a challenge to organizational scholars to build on this special issue to move our understanding of social‐symbolic work forward.</content>

    <title>Coworker Support Exceeding Expectations as a Double‐Edged Sword: The Role of Workplace Status</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most prior research has assumed that employees always appreciate coworker support. However, coworker support exceeding expectations can be considered a double‐edged sword in the workplace. Drawing on expectation violation theory, this research exploreswhenandhowcoworker support exceeding expectations becomes a positive or negative expectation violation that influences employees' interpersonal behaviour. We propose that when employees have a lower level of workplace status, coworker support exceeding their expectations is more likely to be a positive expectation violation and, therefore, will be positively related to employee gratitude and interpersonal citizenship behaviour. In contrast, when employees have a higher level of workplace status, coworker support exceeding expectations tends to be a negative expectation violation and, in turn, is positively related to employee shame and interpersonal counterproductive work behaviour. Two multiwave field surveys with Chinese employees and two scenario‐based experiments with Western workers largely support our hypotheses.</content>

    <title>Organizing for Software Product Development: The Effects of Team Structure, Product Complexity, and Cross-Team Coordination</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how software development team structures influence performance under varying conditions of product and architectural complexity. Using computational simulation grounded in organizational theory, the research compares feature teams—organized around end-to-end functionality—and component teams—organized around technical subsystems. The findings indicate that feature teams generally outperform component teams, particularly when product complexity is high. Moreover, the study reveals that the effectiveness of team structures is moderated by coordination intensity and team scope. Moderate levels of cross-team coordination yield better outcomes than minimal or excessive coordination, whereas broader subteam scopes can improve performance when coordination is costly or limited. These results have significant managerial implications for software development practice: team structure should be aligned with both the problem space and solution space complexity, coordination mechanisms must be strategically calibrated, and team boundaries should be adjusted based on the organization’s capacity to manage dependencies. The study provides a robust framework for informing team design decisions, offering insights relevant to agile software development. Practitioners are encouraged to adopt a contingency-based approach to team organization, tailoring structural choices to contextual demands in order to optimize delivery efficiency and innovation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An important global trend today is the rise of the secondhand market powered by consumers’ desire for sustainability and affordability, as well as a surge in the use of digital resale platforms. While marketing research has primarily focused on the success of new product markets, scant research has tried to understand secondhand markets. To advance knowledge in this area, we investigate how product design innovation affects the value of used products in secondhand markets. Specifically, we develop a framework of theintertemporal distinctiveness of a used product’s design, defined as the extent to which the design of a used product is distinct from the newest design of the same product. We use image-processing software to analyze product pictures and quantify the intertemporal distinctiveness of design. Analyzing a unique dataset of used cars sold in the U.S. automotive market, we find a U-shaped relationship between the intertemporal distinctiveness of design and the resale price of used products. Moreover, we find that the effect of intertemporal distinctiveness is moderated by thewithin-category distinctiveness of a used product, defined as the extent to which a used product’s design is distinct from other used products in the same product category. This study contributes to the research on product design and the determinants of resale prices, providing practical implications for consumers, manufacturers, and dealers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a practical optimization model for the management of a demand-side platform (DSP), which is applicable in static planning situations where the DSP acquires valuable impressions for high-volume advertiser clients in a real-time bidding environment. We propose a highly flexible model for the DSP to maximize its profit while maintaining acceptable levels of budget spending for its advertisers. Our model achieves flexibility and improved performance primarily through two different aspects: (i) we replace standard budget constraints with a more general budget utilization proxy function over budget spending levels, and (ii) we can accommodate arbitrary auction types by directly modeling the interactions between the DSP and the auctions. Our proposed formulation leads to a non-convex optimization problem due to the joint optimization over both impression allocation and bid price decisions. Using Fenchel duality theory, we obtain a convex dual problem that can be efficiently solved with subgradient based algorithms and from which a primal solution may be recovered efficiently. Under a natural and intuitive "increasing marginal cost" condition, as well as under a more general condition, we show that there is zero duality gap between the dual problem and the original non-convex primal problem. Under the same conditions, we also demonstrate convergence of our algorithm to an optimal solution of the non-convex formulation as the dual problem is solved to near optimality. We conduct experiments on both synthetic data as well as data from a real DSP, and our results demonstrate how our algorithm allows the DSP to better trade off between profitability and budget spending as compared to a widely used "greedy" heuristic approach.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates a robust monopoly pricing problem, where a seller seeks tomaximize expected revenue when selling a product to a buyer with limited information, specifically knowing only the mean, variance, and asymmetric information (semivariance) of the buyer’s valuation distribution. We explore both deterministic and randomized pricing strategies and evaluate their performance under these constraints. We formulate two maximin problems aimed at maximizing the worst-case expected revenues. By employing the primal-dual approach in infinite linear programming, we derive the closed-form for the optimal pricing strategies for both maximin problems. Our results show that incorporating semivariance significantly enhances the performance of pricing strategies by better capturing distributional asymmetry. Additionally, we compare the performance of deterministic and randomized pricing in various scenarios, offering valuable insights into how risk and reward can be effectively balanced. Moreover, our results on both pricing strategies provide new bounds for the value of personalized pricing. This comprehensive analysis enables a deeper understanding of semivariance information to improve decision-making and offer practical insights for managing complex pricing decisions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The increasing prevalence of patent infringement litigation in recent decades has imposed significant costs on firms. This paper empirically examines how this legal risk influences a key operational decision: vertical integration. Drawing on the real options theory (ROT), we argue that managers reduce the extent of vertical integration to preserve flexibility and make operational adjustments in anticipation of unfavorable outcomes from patent lawsuits. Using a dataset of public firms and a text-based measure of vertical integration, our findings show that firms facing higher patent litigation risk are less vertically integrated. At the same time, these firms maintain broader supplier networks and product market scopes, consistent with a preference for leveraging market mechanisms to reduce the costs of exercising switch and exit options. The negative relationship between litigation risk and vertical integration is particularly pronounced in durable goods sectors and declining industries, where the ability to divest or halt operations is highly valued. Additionally, we find that firms diversify their supplier base and product and technology portfolios after facing patent lawsuits. However, more vertically integrated firms are slower to make these adjustments, suggesting that they encounter greater friction in exercising real options. Overall, our study highlights the significant role that intellectual property disputes play in shaping corporate vertical integration strategies.</content>

    <title>Robust Optimization with Decision-Dependent Information Discovery</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Robust optimization (RO) is a popular paradigm for modeling and solving two- and multistage decision-making problems affected by uncertainty. In many real-world applications, such as R&amp;D project selection, production planning, or preference elicitation for product or policy recommendations, the time of information discovery is decision-dependent and the uncertain parameters only become observable after an often costly investment. Yet, most of the literature on robust optimization assumes that the uncertain parameters can be observed for free and that the sequence in which they are revealed is independent of the decision-maker’s actions. To fill this gap in the practicability of RO, we consider two- and multistage robust optimization problems in which part of the decision variables control the time of information discovery. Thus, information available at any given time is decision-dependent and can be discovered (at least in part) by making strategic exploratory investments in previous stages. We propose a novel dynamic formulation of the problem and prove its correctness. We leverage our model to provide a solution method inspired from the K-adaptability approximation, whereby K candidate strategies for each decision stage are chosen here-and-now and, at the beginning of each period, the best of these strategies is selected after the uncertain parameters that were chosen to be observed are revealed. We reformulate the problem as a finite mixed-integer (resp. bilinear) program if none (resp. some) of the decision variables are real-valued. This finite program is solvable with off-the-shelf solvers. We generalize our approach to the minimization of piecewise linear convex functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of usability, optimality, and speed on synthetic instances of the Pandora box problem, the preference elicitation problem with real-valued recommendations, the best box problem, and the R&amp;D project portfolio optimization problem. Finally, we evaluate it on an instance of the active preference elicitation problem used to recommend kidney allocation policies to policy-makers at the United Network for Organ Sharing based on real data from the U.S. Kidney Allocation System.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: This work was supported primarily by the Operations Engineering Program of the National Science Foundation under NSF Award No. 1763108.

    <title>Beyond reductionism: rethinking MNEs’ role in environmental crises</title>
    <updated>2025-06-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This counterpoint challenges the view advanced by Yu, Bansal, and Arjaliès (J Int Business Stud 54:1151–1169, 2023), who argue that multinational enterprises (MNEs), by virtue of their cross-border operations, are inherently detrimental to the environment. While Yu et al.’s call for responsible resource use is commendable, we contend that their framework oversimplifies the complex realities of international business (IB). Drawing on New Internalization Theory (NIT), we examine environmental crises through the lens of multilevel complexity—macro-level institutional interdependencies, firm-level heterogeneity, and individual-level cognitive and behavioral constraints. Our approach underscores the role of bounded rationality and bounded reliability across all relevant actors—not just MNE managers—in shaping environmental outcomes. We find that Yu et al.’s proposed strategies give limited attention to the institutional, industry, organizational, and governance conditions under which environmental value is created. By contrast, we apply comparative institutional analysis to investigate MNEs’ impact on the environment as compared to feasible, real-world alternatives. We argue that meaningful environmental progress hinges not on targeting MNEs, but on fostering multilateral coordination among public, private, and civil society actors, with MNEs being well positioned to lead such collaborations. We call for scholarship that avoids ideological overreach, embraces IB theory, and acknowledges MNEs as key agents in advancing environmental sustainability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are increasingly facing decisions about operations in markets affected by geopolitical conflicts that attract global attention, but research that illuminates the consequences of these decisions remains scarce. We develop a theoretical framework that integrates rational expectations theory with the person-situation framework to explain how investors react to firms' operational decisions in such markets. Using Russia's war in Ukraine as our empirical context, we analyze 289 announcements by 237 firms publicly traded in the US and UK during the first month of the conflict. We find that firms announcing a suspension of their operations experience more negative short-term market reactions than firms announcing continued operations. However, these negative reactions are attenuated when suspensions are more anticipated due to prior competitor suspensions, higher public interest in the conflict, larger firm operational footprint in the affected market, and greater pre-conflict media attention focused on the focal firms. This framework provides important insights for managers faced with both market pressures and stakeholder expectations during geopolitical crises, as well as a theoretical basis for scholars to further examine the consequences of turmoil in firms’ international markets.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: From Tools to Agents: Meta-Analytic Insights into Human Acceptance of AI</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more autonomous and socially present, it is critical to understand how people accept AI not just as a technological tool, but also as an agent capable of (semi-)autonomous decision-making and interaction. With a meta-analysis of 287 effect sizes representing over 119,000 individuals, this research examines the factors driving human acceptance of AI. Through a dual-perspectives framework, AI as a tool versus an agent, the authors identify key AI characteristics, including capability, role, expertise scope, and anthropomorphism, that significantly influence acceptance. These engineerable AI characteristics, along with contextual and individual factors, form an AI-task-user framework that explains AI acceptance across different use scenarios and user groups. These findings contribute to the discourse on AI acceptance and human-AI interactions: revealing a small, decreasing reluctance to accept AI and, more importantly, directing future research to empirical testing and theory building of AI acceptance from an agentic perspective. This research also provides actionable user-centered design roadmap for practitioners to develop and communicate AI features that align with human expectations and enhance positive responses, especially at a time when agentic AI is rapidly becoming a technological and societal reality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite being preventable and curable, cervical cancer (CC) claimed 350,000 lives globally in 2024 due to the low adoption of CC screening (CCS). An analysis of the institutional context in India revealed a lack of awareness and disempowering sociocultural stigma and norms as two critical barriers. Simultaneously, trustworthy spokespersons emerged as key enablers of CCS adoption. Three incentive-compatible randomized field experiments were conducted to evaluate the fit and effectiveness of message sources (doctorsvs.peers) and appeal (informative, highlighting the disease’s mortality risk, vs.empowering, addressing health/CCS-related sociocultural taboos) on CCS adoption. While doctors and peers drive greater adoption than infographics when delivering informational messages, willingness to pay is highest for doctors. However, the highest adoption occurs when peers conveyempoweringmessages. The authors also find that doctors and peers reduce the price sensitivity for CCS, a preventive service, relative to infographics. The research underscores the importance of congruence between credible sources and context-specific message appeals in enhancing adoption. Policymakers can prioritize low-cost, context-specific interventions that address sociocultural barriers by using peers as credible messengers. In India alone, this approach could boost adoption by 36.5% and enable 21.07 million more women to undergo CCS.</content>

    <title>Optimal Dual-Sourcing Inventory Policies with Order Tracking: Backlogging and Lost Sales Under Uncertain Lead Times</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dual-Sourcing in the Dark? Order Tracking as Your GuideThis research unlocks the power of real-time order tracking in dual-sourcing inventory systems, tackling both backlogging and lost-sales scenarios. We model a hybrid supply chain: a normal source (a two-stage tandem queue with Erlang processing times) and a fast-track emergency source that skips the first stage. We prove that, under key conditions, the optimal policy follows a dual-threshold structure with an adaptive switching curve, dictated by the emergency source’s workload. We prove this through a three-stage approach: 1) state-space simplification – cutting through complexity; 2) auxiliary system design – introducing a tractable proxy with a novel exchange axiom property to reveal optimal structure; 3) sample-path magic – bridging the proxy’s policy back to the original system. When reality breaks the ideal conditions, we craft a near-optimal heuristic that fully leverages order-tracking information. The analysis reveals a striking contrast; although order tracking benefits both systems, its impact is markedly stronger in lost-sales environments compared to backlogging scenarios.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Smart Servers, Smarter Speed Scaling: A Decentralized Algorithm for Data Center EfficiencyA team of researchers from Georgia Tech and the University of Minnesota has introduced a cutting-edge algorithm designed to optimize energy use in large-scale data centers. As detailed in their paper “Distributed Rate Scaling in Large-Scale Service Systems,” the team developed a decentralized method allowing each server to adjust its processing speed autonomously without the need for communication or knowledge of system-wide traffic. The algorithm uses idle time as a local signal to guide processing speed, ensuring that all servers converge toward a globally optimal performance rate. This innovation addresses a critical issue in modern computing infrastructure: balancing energy efficiency with performance under uncertainty and scale. The authors demonstrate that their approach not only stabilizes the system but achieves asymptotic optimality as the number of servers increases. The work is poised to significantly reduce energy consumption in data centers, which are projected to account for up to 8% of U.S. electricity use by 2030.</content>

    <title>A Theory of Leadership Meta‐Talk and the Talking‐Doing Gap</title>
    <updated>2025-06-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Thomas Fischer, Mats Alvesson</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify managers' meta‐level talk about the positive purpose, meaning, and significance of their actions as an overlooked type of leadership behaviour and call it leadership meta‐talk. We outline why leadership meta‐talk is not necessarily truthful or deceptive, but selective and loosely coupled with leadership practice. We discuss varieties of leadership meta‐talk, namely aspirational, sub‐texting, and sensemaking meta‐talk, as well as principled, situational, formulaic, and casual meta‐talk. We show how all varieties of leadership meta‐talk draw people's attention to positive aspects of leadership practice and provide positive interpretations of it. Thus, leadership meta‐talk can positively influence attributions of leadership and portray workplaces as overly harmonious and well‐ordered, masking power imbalances and tensions and creating a quantitative and qualitative talking‐doing gap. We argue that these talking‐doing gaps are systemic rather than pathological features of the contemporary workplace because overly positive leadership meta‐talk responds to systemic pressures and opportunities for managers and provides egocentric, psycho‐relational, and public‐image benefits. In contrast, leadership practice that lives up to leadership meta‐talk is more costly, difficult, and time‐consuming than commonly assumed. Our theory reconciles attributional, behavioural, and romancing views of leadership, and offers new insights into key organizational and societal challenges, including managing healthy workplace expectations.</content>

    <title>Support for Sustainable Development Goal 5 and Social Performance: The Role of Diversity Targets, Work‐Life Balance Practices, and Female Representation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human resource management (HRM) scholarship has neither fully engaged with the United Nation's sustainable development goal 5 (SDG 5—gender equality) nor deepened knowledge of the human resource practices that most likely contribute to the implementation of this goal. We address this gap by investigating the link between SDG 5 and multinational enterprises' (MNEs) social performance. We posit that attention to SDG 5 will facilitate MNEs' capacity to formulate and implement practices to increase gender equality in work settings. Drawing from the sustainable HRM framework and social role theory, we develop three hypotheses related to the role of diversity targets and work‐life balance practices as mediators of the relationship between support for SDG 5 and MNEs' social performance. We also posit that women's representation across the organizational structure strengthens the relationship between support for SDG 5 and diversity targets as well as work‐life balance practices. We tested these relationships with 418 MNEs in the S&amp;P 500. We found that diversity targets and work‐life balance practices (i.e., flexible arrangements and daycare services) mediate the relationship between support for SDG 5 and social performance. In addition, the interaction between women's representation and support for SDG 5 enhances diversity targets and flexible arrangements. We theoretically contribute to the sustainable HRM literature by (a) revealing the reasons for a spillover effect of support for gender equality to other demographic groups; (b) explaining broader societal impacts of support for SDG 5 on the workforce, community, human rights, and product responsibility. To successfully integrate SDG 5, MNEs must weave diversity targets and work‐life balance practices into strategic planning.</content>

    <title>How founders' values enable business model innovation in new ventures: The case of Magnum Photos</title>
    <updated>2025-06-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study explores why and how founders' values lead them to design novel business models. To address these questions, we conducted a historical case study of Magnum Photos, a photo agency whose novel business model revolutionized magazine photography in the mid‐20th century. Our abductive analysis reveals that personal values can be a principal driving force for business model innovation (BMI). Actors who believe that their personal values are difficult to reconcile with existing business models engage in BMI to retain control over activities that are perceived to be central to their values. Our findings highlight values as an important and hitherto under‐studied antecedent of BMI and of entrepreneurial innovation and strategy more generally.Managerial SummaryWhat drives business model innovation in startups? Our study finds that personal values can be a powerful force. Through an in‐depth historical analysis of Magnum Photos, a pioneering photo agency, we reveal how its founders' commitment to creative freedom and integrity led them to reject conventional business models and design an entirely new one. Unlike traditional agencies, Magnum's founders saw certain activities—such as taking, editing, and distributing photographs—as inseparable. This led them to create a cooperative model where photographers retained full control over their work. The new business model not only protected their values but also reshaped the photojournalism industry. This study highlights an overlooked driver of innovation: when personal values clash with existing models, entrepreneurs may be compelled to create new ones.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Intra-Category Multi-Choice Preferences Learning and Assortment Recommendation in E-Commerce</title>
    <updated>2025-06-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a framework for learning customer preferences and optimizing e-commerce assortments, focusing on intra-category multi-choice behavior, where customers buy multiple items within the same category. Unlike traditional discrete choice models (DCMs) that assume single-product purchases, e-commerce data show frequent intra-category multi-product purchases, especially during promotions. To capture this, we introduce the multi-choice rank list model (MC-RLM), which accounts for both multi-choice and substitution effects. Each customer type is defined by a preference ranking and an intended purchase quantity (IPQ), allowing selection of up to IPQ products. The MC-RLM adheres to the regularity axiom and aligns with random utility theory.We present the multi-choice market discovery (MCMD) algorithm to estimate the MC-RLM, extending single-purchase methods to multi-purchase settings. We also introduce behavior-reveal-preference (BRP) rules, using customer behavior data (e.g., clicks, cart additions) to enhance preference estimation. Given the NP-hardness of the assortment optimization problem, we analyze the performance of the revenue-ordered assortments heuristic and provide guarantees. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that can generate personalized recommendations based on real-time customer data. Extensive numerical experiments, including a case study using Tmall data, demonstrate that the MC-RLM outperforms models such as the Independent Choice Model (ICM) and the Multi-Purchase Multinomial Logit (MP-MNL) in predictive accuracy, with BRP rules further enhancing performance. Synthetic experiments confirm that accurately modeling multi-purchase behavior significantly boosts expected revenue.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Information about the number of applicants to a job vacancy might simultaneously signal the degree of competition and vacancy quality. We study how this information affects job search. To do so, we conduct three experiments on a large online job platform in which the treatment varies what information is shown to job seekers. Information about the number of prior applicants to a vacancy increases the number of applications and redirects them to vacancies with few prior applications. Information about vacancy age increases application rates, especially to new vacancies. To further investigate the causal mechanisms, we conduct and analyze a survey choice experiment. We conclude that job seekers prefer to avoid competition rather than use the popularity of a vacancy as a signal of quality.This paper was accepted by Karan Girotra, operations management.Funding: This research was facilitated through a research consulting agreement between A.

    <title>EXPRESS: The Impact of Ad Length on Ad Effectiveness: Do Micro Ads Work?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As media viewers shift expectations toward content and ads, advertisers are increasingly exploring micro ads. Yet, limited research has examined micro ads, especially on TV. This research uses a multimethod approach to investigate micro ad effectiveness on behavioral outcomes and, more broadly, provide insights into the relationship between ad length and ad effectiveness in the current media landscape. Analyzing observational data on retailers’ TV advertising, web traffic, and online sales, the authors find that micro ads spur more immediate web traffic than longer ads. Micro and non-micro ads exhibit similar direct impacts on online sales, but micro ads can indirectly increase online sales more by driving increased traffic. Results from a field experiment using social media ads corroborate these findings, showing that micro ads outperform non-micro ads in driving web traffic and social media engagement. The analyses suggest that viewer impatience for longer ads may be a plausible mechanism that explains why micro ads see increased effectiveness. The findings offer timely insights for advertisers and ad platforms seeking economical, attractive ad inventory.</content>

    <title>The Persistence or Diminishment of Employee Stewardship Behaviour: Exploring the Crucial Roles of Supervisors' Cultural Orientation, Admiration, and Status Conferral</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scholars and practitioners have long sought to clarify ways to motivate employees to engage in stewardship behaviour, which involves personal sacrifices for the public interest. However, a critical question remains unanswered: How does a supervisor's cultural orientation, admiration, and status conferral determine the persistence or diminishment of employees' stewardship behaviour? Drawing on the moral virtue theory of status attainment, we argue that employees' stewardship behaviour either promotes or diminishes subsequent actions through increased or decreased admiration and status conferral from supervisors, depending on supervisors' cultural orientations. Study 1, a vignette‐based experiment involving 222 participants, revealed that supervisors with a collectivist orientation tend to admire and grant status to employees who exhibit stewardship behaviour, whereas those with an individualist orientation tend to decrease such feedback. Study 2, a four‐wave survey with 302 leader–employee dyads, replicated these findings and further explained the role of status conferral in sustaining or diminishing stewardship behaviour in the future. This research advances stewardship theory by revealing the complex dynamics that sustain stewardship behaviour and provides valuable insights for managers aiming to motivate employees to consistently engage in stewardship behaviour.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Financial market regulators have long debated the appropriate frequency of mandatory corporate financial disclosures. Whereas frequent disclosures may help deter overinvestment, they may also encourage short-termism. This paper reports an experiment that examines the effects of varying reporting frequencies on managerial investment decisions. Experimental results indicate that frequent reporting modestly induces short-termism, but it fails to reduce the overinvestment observed in the infrequent reporting regime. Nonbinding communication of intended investment plans does reduce overinvestment, but only in the infrequent reporting regime.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [Grant SES 1949112].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01955 .</content>

    <title>The Consequences of Narrow Framing for Risk Taking: A Stress Test of Myopic Loss Aversion</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Narrow bracketing in combination with loss aversion has been shown to reduce individual risk taking. This is known as myopic loss aversion (MLA) and has been corroborated by many studies. Recent evidence has contested this notion, indicating that MLA’s applicability is confined to highly artificial settings. Given the impact of these findings, we reevaluated the evidence on MLA with substantially higher statistical power than in almost all previous studies. We systematically modified the seminal study design by Gneezy and Potters [Gneezy U, Potters J (1997) An experiment on risk taking and evaluation periods. Quart. J. Econom. 112(2):631–645] to include five key adjustments. These involved downscaled returns, return compounding, and extended investment horizons. Our results, which are highly robust to analytical heterogeneity, consistently document the presence of MLA across all experimental conditions.This paper was accepted by John Beshears, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05720 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Africa’s startup ecosystem is growing rapidly, yet venture capital (VC) funding remains disproportionately allocated to non-African founders. This study investigates the factors driving this disparity, focusing on institutional voids – gaps in legal frameworks, financial infrastructure, and market-supporting institutions – and investors’ perceptions of risk and financial discrimination. We conducted 37 interviews with investors and entrepreneurs to identify the determinants of VC funding, including startup location, founder origin, and international networks. Additionally, a qualitative comparative analysis of 335 African fintech startups revealed the factor configurations that enable startups to secure high levels of VC investment. Historically, the findings reveal that non-African founders have benefited from investor homophily, a preference for investing in individuals with similar backgrounds, to mitigate the perceived risks related to institutional voids. By contrast, African founders faced greater barriers to funding. However, as Africa’s VC ecosystem has matured, local founders have begun to overcome these obstacles. By linking institutional voids to homophily and embedding a postcolonial perspective, acknowledging how historical power dynamics and colonial legacies shape investor perceptions and market structures, this study sheds light on the systemic biases that shape VC funding. These findings offer actionable insights for investors, policymakers, and entrepreneurs aiming to foster a more inclusive VC landscape.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this study, we examine over 100 years of Rothschild’s international activity: we analyze this multinational enterprise’s (MNE’s) cross-border transfer of family-derived firm-specific advantages (FSAs) and the challenges of recombination thereof with novel resources. Family-derived FSAs hinge on the resources and features of the owning and controlling family. During the period of Rothschild’s international success in 19th-century Europe, the family itself served as a recombination mechanism for linking family-derived FSAs with complementary resources across borders. However, deploying family-derived FSAs in the American market and recombining these with nonfamily resources was hindered by bifurcation bias (a dysfunctional, affect-based heuristic characterizing family firms). We trace the manifestations of bifurcation bias over time and investigate its multifaceted impact on Rothschild’s internationalization. We suggest that effective resource recombination in host markets can be constrained by atwo-stage authenticationprocess. Here, the bifurcation bias in a first stage can influence which complementary resources in foreign markets will be accessed and how these will be integrated inside the firm. In a second stage, bifurcation bias can affect the functioning of the very actors supposed to be linking the complementary resources to be utilized and the extant, family-derived FSAs.</content>

    <title>Sparking Innovation: The Effect of Inventor Gender Diversity on Recombinant Innovation</title>
    <updated>2025-06-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how inventor gender diversity influences firm innovation, particularly recombinant intensity that signifies the firm’s capacity to combine distant knowledge domains into new solutions. Using 23 years of U.S. patent data (1.8 million patents, 4,769 firms) and a novel text-based recombination measure (SPaRK), the study finds that a higher share of female inventors increases firms’ recombinant innovation intensity, patent output, citations, and innovation efficiency. Moreover, inventor gender diversity enhances the innovation productivity of female inventors. Cross-gender collaboration emerges as the key mechanism for these gains, enabling firms to unlock the “diversity bonus,” especially for recombinant intensity. Interestingly, the diversity bonus is not homogenous and depends on how central females are within the firm’s knowledge network. Greater gender diversity also translates into better financial outcomes for firms, indicating that the innovation gains outweigh the costs of diversity. For managers, the study suggests not only hiring and retaining a gender-diverse inventor workforce, but also facilitating cross-gender collaborative environments to activate recombinant intensity and other innovation gains, especially at firms where female inventors are not central. For policymakers, the study provides support for expanding female STEM higher education pipelines to enhance the supply of female inventors and ultimately spark corporate innovation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a satisficing model of choice in which the available alternatives differ in their inherent complexity. We assume—and experimentally validate—that complexity leads to errors in the perception of alternatives’ values. The model yields sharp predictions about the effect of complexity on choice probabilities, some of which qualitatively contrast with those of maximization-based choice models. We confirm the predictions of the satisficing model—and thus reject maximization—in a novel data set with information on hundreds of millions of real-world chess moves by highly experienced players. Looking beyond chess, our work offers a blueprint for incorporating complexity at the level of individual objects into models of choice and for detecting satisficing outside of the laboratory.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How much does firm intangibility amplify CEOs’ persistent private information and reduce firms’ public listing propensity? We develop a model of competing public and private investors financing firms heterogeneously exposed to persistent private cash flows. Equilibrium financing is driven by information rent differentials in CEO compensation. We validate and structurally estimate the model using firm listing and CEO compensation data. We find private (intangible) cash flows exhibit 63% higher persistence than their tangible counterparts. Further, if firm intangibility levels returned to those of 1980, mean listing propensities would increase 5 percentage points while mean CEO variable pay growth would decrease by 61%.</content>

    <title>The consequences of expanded audit reporting: implications of tax key audit matters for tax attribute valuation and auditor-provided tax services</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the consequences of tax key audit matters (KAMs) to the valuation of tax attributes and to auditor-provided tax services (APTS). The literature finds that KAM adoption is not associated with investor or audit outcomes, creating an impetus to identify whether specific KAM topics are more consequential. Tax KAMs are an ideal setting because they are prevalent, taxes are economically important, and auditors can provide tax services to their clients. We find that investors discount the tax avoidance and deferred tax assets of tax-KAM companies, suggesting an incentive for managers to avoid tax KAMs. Consistent with self-interest threats to auditor independence, we find that receiving a tax KAM is negatively associated with clients’ concurrent purchases of APTS, but that clients increase their future purchases of these services when they stop receiving tax KAMs. These results reveal novel consequences of tax KAMs to the valuation of companies’ tax attributes and to APTS incentives.</content>

    <title>Reimbursement Policy and Drug Shortages</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generic drug shortages have posed significant challenges to the U.S. pharmaceutical industry and the government for two decades, causing severe consequences and drawing widespread attention. Substantial efforts have been devoted to identifying the causes, with some linking shortages to Medicare’s adoption of the average sales price (ASP) policy for hospital drug reimbursement. However, little research has captured the connections among reimbursement policies, shortages, and the influence of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which play a key role in representing hospitals to set prices with manufacturers. Recognizing that the reimbursement policy influences shortages through affecting supply chain parties’ decisions, we analyze a drug supply model that captures the essential elements and tradeoffs in drug wholesale price decisions. We find that under the ASP policy, the interplay of two opposing effects, the free-ride effect and the aligning effect, guides wholesale pricing decisions and affects shortage outcomes. We capture key factors influencing these effects and show that the ASP policy actually possesses resistance to shortages of drugs that have experienced shortages. Overcoming the challenges of limited data transparency, especially on GPOs, we further conduct numerical analysis incorporating various data sources (with the aid of machine learning) to gain additional insights. In addition to confirming ASP’s resistance to shortages, the numerical analysis quantitatively investigates the impact of policy and GPO-related parameters. We provide a thorough discussion of policy implications based on our theoretical and numerical findings. Notably, compared with the previously adopted fixed-price reimbursement policy, which we model as a benchmark in our analysis, ASP represents a market-data-driven policy. This distinction underscores the importance of a deep understanding of such policies for future policy evaluation and shortage mitigation.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02223 .</content>

    <title>Mind the Gap: A Psychological and Structural Perspective on Activist Shareholders’ Targeting of Women CEOs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An important challenge faced by women CEOs is that their firms tend to receive more shareholder activism than firms with men CEOs. Frequently, this activism represents attempts by shareholders to direct or override the decisions made by the firms’ leaders. The current paper integrates micro and macro perspectives to explore the factors influencing gender differences in shareholder activism. Drawing on social psychology research, we examine gender role expectations and perceived lack of fit as underlying psychological mechanisms, and we use industry gender type (i.e., men- or women-dominated industry) as an important structural factor that shapes the effects of these psychological mechanisms and women CEOs’ propensity to be targeted by shareholder activism. We test the hypotheses using archival data of shareholder activism at S&amp;P 1500 companies. We also use two vignette-based experiments to examine the underlying mechanisms for why CEO gender relates to shareholder activism differently across industries. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.</content>

    <title>This Paper Is Not for Everyone: The Impact of Dissuasive Framing on Consumer Response to Product Messages</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Conventional wisdom and past research converge on the notion that product messages are more effective when they use a persuasive frame that directly addresses the product’s target customers to indicate a preference match (e.g., “If you like dark coffee, this is the coffee for you!”). In contrast, the current research identifies scenarios where consumers respond more favorably to dissuasive frames—that is, to messages that address the consumers not targeted by the product to indicate a preference mismatch (e.g., “If you don’t like dark coffee, this is not the coffee for you!”). Eight experiments using mixed methods demonstrate that the impact of dissuasive framing on consumer response is positive for target customers and negative for nontarget customers. This occurs because dissuasive framing increases perceptions of the product as a specialized offering intended for a more narrowly-defined target segment (ie, target specificity). Target specificity, in turn, increases (vs. decreases) the perceived fit between the product and target (vs. nontarget) customers, which drives their response. This research sheds light on a novel form of framing and introduces target specificity as a construct with important implications for consumers’ perceptions of fit with a product and their downstream responses.</content>

    <title>Is Fitness Technology-Facilitated Social Comparison the Thief of Well-Being? The Mediating Role of Social Comparison on the Relationships Between Passion and Performance Self-Esteem</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice and Policy AbstractPopular fitness technologies such as Fitbit, Strava, MyFitnessPal, and Apple Fitness+ provide users with information enabling them to compare their activity to that of other exercisers they have added to their app. However, different people will interpret this social comparison information in different ways. This study provides one explanation as to why social comparison information provided by fitness technologies leads to differing performance self-esteem outcomes for exercisers. What we find is that exercisers holding a harmonious passion for their exercise activity can interpret fitness technology-facilitated social comparison information in an adaptive way; that is, to see better others as a state they can obtain and worse others as evidence of their success. Conversely, the obsessively passionate are prone to interpreting such information in maladaptive ways; that is, to see better performing others as evidence of their own failure and other’s poor performance as a sign that they will also falter. These maladaptive interpretations may lead to psychological harm (e.g., reduced self-esteem and well-being). Stemming from these findings, we suggest fitness technology developers consider designing their apps to adapt to exerciser’s characteristics, such as passion, to minimize the negative effects of fitness technology-facilitated social comparison information.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building on prior research about the heterogeneous impact of labor shocks on individuals' propensity to start businesses, we explore how local labor market frictions affect individuals' selection into platform‐based entrepreneurship. Combining detailed data from a large online retail platform with sectoral employment statistics across labor market areas in the United States, we show that entrepreneurs entering the platform during larger local employment declines in related sectors developed more effective customer strategies and maintained stronger sales performance. These entrepreneurs focused more on customer appeal, matched social media channels with the platform's predominant user base, and lowered prices over time.Managerial SummaryThis article examines how local labor market frictions in sectors relevant to a digital platform shape the heterogeneous entry of individuals into platform‐based entrepreneurship—a class of entrepreneurship that became popular with “creator economy” business models where individuals rely on digital infrastructures to access potential customers and monetize their creative labor. We find that entrepreneurs who started platform‐based businesses in deteriorating local employment conditions generated significantly higher sales by being more attuned to customers' needs and wants. We show that these entrepreneurs emphasized customer‐related activities, chose more effective social media channels, and set lower prices after operating for a few periods. Our findings highlight the importance of customer‐related competitive advantages in platform‐based entrepreneurship.</content>

    <title>Partner Similarity and Crossover Product Development: Evidence From the &lt;scp&gt;PC&lt;/scp&gt; Game Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study addresses a critical gap in understanding the development of crossover products, particularly in the context of collaborative product development within the PC game market's supply chain. Traditionally, firms have focused on incorporating common product characteristics from a single market segment (e.g., genre) to minimize potential penalties associated with ambiguous product identities. However, recent trends show that “crossover” products, those that integrate distinctive features from multiple segments, have emerged due to their superior performance. Developing such innovative products requires profound expertise across multiple market segments, especially when supply chain partners collaborate. While prior research has explored the market performance of crossover products, it has offered limited understanding of the conditions required for their development. To address this gap, we propose a theoretical framework grounded in the input–output perspective of operations management, which examines how portfolio similarity between partners influences the ease of expertise reconfiguration and the breadth of segment‐spanning expertise needed for crossover product development. Our findings reveal an inverted U‐shaped relationship between portfolio similarity and the degree of crossover, suggesting that moderate similarity fosters the most effective reconfiguration of expertise. Further, we find that collaboration experience with the partner moderates the inverted U‐shaped relationship.</content>

    <title>Politicized Framing of the Future: Encouraging Innovation in Mature Ecosystems in the Face of Asymmetric De Alio Entrants</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Hubs and participants of mature ecosystems increasingly compete with de alio entrants that are hubs of more innovative ecosystems. Prior research shows how these asymmetric de alio entrants frame to win over participants from mature ecosystems and suggests that hubs of these ecosystems should respond by encouraging innovation among participants. However, extant theory does not explain how hubs frame to achieve this goal. We address this issue by studying a European carmaker who faced Google as an asymmetric de alio entrant. We find that the carmaker encouraged innovation by framing the future. Interestingly, it did so not through business narratives (as entrants do), but through narratives from technology policy discourses – it thus engaged in a politicized framing of the future. We identified two variants of this framing mechanism. First, the carmaker engaged invisionary politicized framing of the future, thereby encouraging innovation in enabling technologies. Second, it pursuedidealistic politicized framing of the future, which promoted innovation in modular technologies. We develop a framework that explains when, how, and why hubs of mature ecosystems frame to encourage innovation in the face of asymmetric de alio entrants. Our study contributes to scholarship on incumbent framing in ecosystems, temporal framing, and inter‐ecosystem competition.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how sales and employment growth shape employee job satisfaction in startups. Grounded in Penrosean growth theory and related literature, we propose an inverted U‐shaped relationship, where excessive growth triggers the “Penrose Effect” and impairs employee job satisfaction. Analysis of multilevelGlassdoor.comdata reveals modest support for this relationship in employment growth, which is stronger for firms undergoing rapid workforce expansion. Exploratory text analysis further suggests that rapid employment growth exposes socio‐structural challenges, and rapid sales growth reveals managerial deficiencies in the scaling of revenues. The differences between these mediating mechanisms suggest that the Penrose effect may be less binding than previously theorized, warranting further scrutiny. Our findings bridge macro‐level growth dynamics with micro‐level employee experiences, providing insights into the contemporary challenges of rapidly growing firms.Managerial SummaryDoes startup growth enhance the employee work experience? If so, is it bound by the rate of growth? Our study offers insights into these questions by combiningGlassdoor.comreviews with startup financial data and reveals that moderate levels of growth can enhance employee job satisfaction, while rapid expansion can undermine it. We identify two key mechanisms: first, rapid employment growth strains workplace dynamics, creating challenges with diversity, inclusion, and team cohesion. Second, rapid sales growth exposes management's limitations in scaling products and services effectively. For startup leaders, these findings shed light on how the tradeoffs of accelerated growth can cascade into employee‐level challenges that impair job satisfaction.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bank capital requirements are based on book values, which are slow to reflect losses. In this article, we develop a dynamic model of banks to study the interaction of regulation and delayed accounting. Our model explains four stylized facts: book and market values diverge during crises, the market-to-book ratio predicts future profitability, book leverage constraints rarely bind strictly even as market leverage fans out during crises, and banks delever gradually after net-worth shocks. We show how delayed accounting can allow the regulator to achieve better outcomes than immediate (mark-to-market) accounting. In an estimated version of the model, the optimal regulation couples faster loan-loss recognition with a modest relaxation of the book leverage constraint.</content>

    <title>A Theory of Cash Flow-Based Financing with Distress Resolution</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a dynamic contracting theory of asset- and cash flow-based financing that demonstrates how firm, intermediary, and capital market characteristics jointly shape firms’ financing constraints. A firm with imperfect access to equity financing covers financing needs through costly sources: an intermediary and retained cash. The firm’s financing capacity is endogenously determined by either the liquidation value of assets (asset-based) or the intermediary’s going-concern valuation of the firm’s cash flows (cash flow-based). The optimal contract is implemented with defaultable debt—specifically unsecured credit lines and senior-secured debt—and features risk-sharing via bankruptcy. When the firm does well, it repays its debt in full. When it does poorly, distress resolution mirrors U.S. bankruptcy procedures (Chapters 7 and 11). Secured and unsecured debt are complements because risk-sharing via unsecured debt increases secured debt capacity. Debt and equity are dynamic complements because future access to equity financing increases current debt capacity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates how tax loss carryforward (LCF) rules influence corporate bankruptcies and market-wide productivity. Analyzing data from 29 European countries, I find that stricter LCF deductibility limits significantly increase bankruptcy likelihoods. This is because stricter LCF deductibility limits lower the present value of net operating losses (NOLs) as tax assets, reducing the incentive to keep struggling firms alive. This effect is especially pronounced for business group firms, which can support struggling affiliates through internal capital markets to strategically exploit NOLs. My results suggest that lenient LCF deductibility limits can sustain unproductive firms, impacting market-wide resource allocation and productivity. These findings highlight the trade-off in tax policy between supporting firm survival and ensuring efficient resource allocation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Gender imbalance in time spent on child rearing causes gender inequalities in labor market outcomes, human capital accumulation, and economic mobility. We conduct a large-scale field experiment with a near-universe of US schools to investigate a potential source of inequality: external demands for parental involvement. Schools receive an email from a fictitious two-parent household and are asked to call one of the parents back. Mothers are 1.4 times more likely than fathers to be contacted. We decompose this inequality and demonstrate that the gender gap in external demands is associated with various measures of gender norms. We also show that signaling a father’s availability substantially changes the gender pattern of callbacks. Our findings underscore a process through which agents outside the household contribute to within-household gender inequalities.</content>

    <title>Are Inflationary Shocks Regressive? A Feasible Set Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a framework to measure the welfare impact of macroeconomic shocks throughout the distribution. The first-order impact of a shock is summarized by the induced movements in agents’ feasible sets: their budget constraint and borrowing constraints. We combine estimated impulse response functions with micro-data on household consumption bundles, asset holdings, and labor income for different US households. We find that inflationary oil shocks are regressive, but monetary expansions are progressive, and there is substantial heterogeneity throughout the life cycle. In all cases, the dominant channel is the effect of the shock on the cost of accumulating assets, not movements in goods prices or labor income.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When a platform has limited inventory, it is important to have a variety of products available for each customer while managing the remaining stock. To maximize revenue over the long term, the assortment policy needs to take into account the complex purchasing behavior of customers whose arrival orders and preferences may be unknown. We propose a data-driven approach for dynamic assortment planning that utilizes historical customer arrivals and transaction data. To address the challenge of online assortment customization, we use a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework and employ a model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to solve the online assortment policy because of the computational challenge. Our method uses a specially designed deep neural network (DNN) model to create assortments while observing the inventory constraints, and an Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to update the parameters of the DNN model, with the help of a simulator built from the historical transaction data. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct simulations using both a synthetic data set generated with a pre-determined customer type distribution and ground-truth choice model, as well as a real-world data set. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach produces significantly higher long-term revenue compared to some existing methods and remains robust under various practical conditions.We also demonstrate that our approach can be easily adapted to a more general problem that includes reusable products, where customers might return purchased items. In this setting, we find that our approach performs well under various usage time distributions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Humans and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms increasingly interact on unstructured managerial tasks. We propose that tailoring this human-AI interaction to align with individuals’ cognitive preferences is essential for enhancing performance. This hypothesis is examined through a field experiment in a multinational pharmaceutical firm. In the experiment, we manipulated four contextual parameters of human-AI interaction—work procedures, decision-making authority, training, and incentives—to align with sales experts’ cognitive styles, categorized as either adaptors or innovators. Our results show that tailored interaction significantly improves sales performance, whereas untailored interaction results in negative treatment effects compared with both the tailored and control conditions. Qualitative evidence suggests that this negative outcome arises from role conflicts and ambiguities in untailored interaction. Exploring the mechanisms underlying these outcomes further, a mediation analysis of AI login data reveals that human-AI interaction tailoring leads sales experts to adjust their AI utilization, which contributes to the observed performance outcomes. These findings support a human-centered approach to AI that prioritizes individuals’ information-processing needs and tailors their interaction with AI accordingly.This paper has been This paper was accepted by Catherine Tucker for the Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: This work was supported by Erling Persson Family Foundation; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung [Grants 100013M 204670, 181364, 185164]; Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse samt Tore Browaldhs Stiftelse [Grant W20-0036]; Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation [Grants 2021.0074, 2021.0133].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03849 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on productivity in the context of taxi drivers. The AI we study assists drivers with finding customers by suggesting routes along which the demand is predicted to be high. We find that AI improves drivers’ productivity by shortening the cruising time, and this gain is accrued only to low-skilled drivers, narrowing the productivity gap between high- and low-skilled drivers by 13.4%. This case study provides evidence that AI and skill are indeed substitutes, offering direct support for the underlying assumption of recent projection exercises regarding job displacement by AI.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI [Grants 23K25495, 23H00828, 22H00847, 22H05009, and 22H00057], JST RISTEX [Grant JPMJRX18H3], and JST ERATO [Grant JPMJER2301].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01631 .</content>

    <title>Privacy and Polarization: An Inference-Based Framework</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Advances in behavioral targeting allow media firms to better monetize based on advertising. However, behavioral ad targeting requires consumer tracking, which has heightened privacy concerns among consumers and regulators. We examine how stricter privacy regulations that ban consumer tracking affect media firms’ content strategies and ideological positioning. We consider a model where media firms choose their ideological positioning and advertising, whereas ideologically heterogeneous consumers select their preferred content based on both their ideology and idiosyncratic taste shocks. We compare two salient informational environments: (1) behavioral ad targeting, where perfect inference about consumers is allowed, and (2) contextual ad targeting, where consumer tracking is banned due to privacy regulations, and media firms can only infer consumer types based on their media choice. We show that privacy regulations that ban behavioral ad targeting incentivize media firms to shift toward more extreme and polarizing positioning in order to draw better inferences about consumer types, even though the shift to more extreme ideological positions can hurt both demand and consumer welfare from content consumption. Compared with the monopoly case, competition increases firms’ inference motives and leads to more polarized content over a wider range of parameters due to an inferential complementarity effect arising from consumer self-selection. Our research uncovers a previously unexplored relationship between privacy and polarization, shedding light on the potential unintended consequences of privacy regulations in media markets.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the NET Institute.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06054 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: In-Store Advertising with Digital Signage</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digital signage at the point of sale is emerging as a significant revenue source for retailers and a growing advertising platform for manufacturing brands. Yet, empirical research on its effectiveness remains limited. This study leverages a novel technology and field experimental data spanning 237 advertising campaigns and 30 million shoppers to fill this gap. We find that digital signage increases the likelihood of purchasing featured products by 8.1%. This effect is amplified for hedonic, novel, and low-priced products, as well as for popular brands. It is also stronger on weekends, later in the day, during favorable weather, in crowded stores, for emotional advertising messages, and in the absence of concurrent promotional cues. The impact of digital signage further increases when it is placed in close proximity to the advertised product. Unlike price promotions, digital signage does not affect spending for those who purchase the products. Notably, exposure to digital signage also boosts sales of other products from the same brand and within the same category, without causing purchase acceleration—indicating that it drives incremental consumption. These findings offer new insights into the efficacy of in-store advertising with digital signage and provide actionable guidance for optimizing its use.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Rise of Broadband and the Retail Landscape: Evidence from Consumer Packaged Goods</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The proliferation of broadband internet has sparked concerns about the future of brick-and-mortar retail. I explore consumer behavior in the US consumer packaged goods (CPG) sector during broadband’s proliferation from 2004 to 2019. Using household panel and retail scanner data covering more than 40,000 brands in 900 categories, I analyze nine household and retailer outcomes: brands purchased, trips taken, retailers visited, offline spending, any online spending, online spending share, prices, price dispersion, and demand elasticities. I combine US Census and FCC data to track the rollout of broadband. In contrast to established notions that broadband adoption would rapidly transform shopping behaviors in this period, my findings reveal a more nuanced and gradual pattern of change. Exploiting geographic variation in broadband growth, I find economically modest average effects with significant heterogeneity by age and household income. The analysis reveals generational differences, sharp declines in brick-and-mortar shopping among younger consumers counterbalanced by relative stability in larger older cohorts. In short, this paper finds that broadband access drove a gradual evolution in consumer behavior, rather than a dramatic upheaval.</content>

    <title>Indigenizing Brokerage: How Western Brokers Bridge Environment and Nature Worldviews in Global Market Relations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Brokering between actors such as Indigenous producers and Western multinationals participating in global market relations typically requires bridging different worldviews, each with different implications for economic activity: a ‘nature’ worldview where production is often limited to preserve ecological balance, and an ‘environment’ worldview where nature is a resource to be exploited. Given these differences and the traditional hegemony of Western actors, the question of whether and how brokers can facilitate market relations that are beneficial for Indigenous and Western actors alike becomes pressing. Building on recent decolonial literature that has highlighted the possibility of rendering traditionally Western‐dominated market relations ‘more Indigenous’ or ‘less colonial’ and cultural brokerage scholarship, we conducted a case study of a Western consulting firm brokering between an MNC and Indigenous communities in Costa Rica. Based on an effective brokering process after a perceived crisis point, we theorize the model of ‘Indigenizing brokerage’ to explain how brokering between the two worldviews can lead to mutual benefits through three interrelated processes. Contributing to the literature on cultural brokerage and decolonial scholarship, the model introduces a much‐needed framework to better understand what ‘more Indigenous’ could mean in global market relations and adds insights into supply chain brokerage.</content>

    <title>Kinesthetic Properties of Response Scales Yield Different Judgments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research examines how the movements an interface requires of a consumer—that is, its “kinesthetic properties”—can alter what a consumer attends to when responding and, in turn, change the response itself. We compare the kinesthetic properties of two ubiquitous scale formats, slider and radio-button scales. Six studies (plus four in the Web Appendix) show dragging a slider (vs. clicking a radio button) elicits responses that are closer to the scale starting point. This effect occurs because the slider allows participants to engage with the scale as they consider their options. When dragging past each response option, attention is directed to that option, increasing its chance of being selected. Supporting this account, sliders only result in responses closer to the starting point when participants physically drag the cursor across options to their desired response, not when they directly click on it. Furthermore, participants dragging a slider interact with the scale earlier in the judgment process and exhibit a greater visual focus on left-side (vs. right-side) options on the scale compared to participants clicking a radio button. These findings suggest marketers, graphic designers, and researchers should consider how the kinesthetic properties of digital interfaces may shape consumer judgment.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractCan organizational boundaries still hinder knowledge-sharing in an online setting such as corporate online communities? Whereas the existing studies usually respond “yes” to the question, our study argues that this is not necessarily the case. We propose and empirically test two key motivations driving knowledge-sharing inclinations subjected to organizational boundaries, namely, knowledge-focused motivations and social-related motivations. Our analyses focus on departmental boundaries using data from a large corporate Q&amp;A platform. We show a robust pattern: employees are more inclined to share knowledge within their departments (i.e., intradepartmental knowledge-sharing inclination). Notably, intradepartmental knowledge-sharing inclination is uniquely driven more by knowledge-focused motivations (versus social-related motivations). Managers should consider the revealed intradepartmental knowledge-sharing inclination when designing policies to promote knowledge sharing across departmental boundaries, and the focus should be on social-related motivations. Also, it is worth noting that intradepartmental knowledge-sharing inclination is also driven by knowledge-focused reasons, reflected by knowledge providers’ desire to share helpful knowledge, and the knowledge-focused mechanisms are not necessarily detrimental to knowledge sharing. Finally, it is reassuring that we do not find negative associations between intradepartmental knowledge sharing and individual material outcomes such as work performance and promotions.</content>
