    <title>Differential Privacy via Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Privacy-Accuracy Trade-off from an Optimization Lens: Fix a Desired Level of Privacy, Then Maximize AccuracyIn differential privacy, the de facto standard for safeguarding individual information in data analysis, noise is added to statistics to limit the disclosure of sensitive information. Greater privacy requires more noise, creating a trade-off as the added noise reduces the accuracy of the resulting statistics. Historically, researchers have addressed this by restricting themselves to families of noise mechanisms that are sufficient for a predefined privacy level and proving their performance under specific conditions. Selvi, Liu, and Wiesemann propose a novel approach that guarantees optimal accuracy for any specified privacy level. They formulate the design of privacy mechanisms as an optimization problem that minimizes the expected loss associated with the random noise mechanism while encoding differential privacy as constraints. Through detailed analyses and by leveraging tools from distributionally robust optimization, they develop an efficient optimization algorithm and derive implementable solutions with provable guarantees to solve the problem within seconds.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this study, we leverage the transformation of a performance management system that shifts from only providing a performance rating to also providing an explicit assessment of potential. Although performance measures enable organizations to evaluate an employee’s past performance, they provide limited information regarding the employee’s potential to perform in a prospective job that requires a different skill set. Consequently, firms are gradually moving toward the incorporation of explicit potential assessments in their annual appraisal process to evaluate the employee’s promotability to a different task environment. Our data access allows us to provide evidence on the consequences of implementing a performance management system that adopted the explicit assessment of potential. We find that, on average, the performance of promoted employees is lower after implementation, suggesting that the potential assessment system is less effective in identifying candidates suitable for promotion. Additional analyses lead us to conclude that the difficulty of evaluating employee potential reduces performance upon promotion because of inaccurate recommendations of supervisors who do not sufficiently differentiate in their ratings. We thus identify variation in supervisors’ evaluation quality as an important source of the Peter Principle.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02199 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employees respond differently to felt trust from their supervisor. We propose and test an organization‐based self‐esteem (OBSE)‐contingent work engagement model of felt trustthat predicts task performance and work‐to‐home conflict. We argue that employees use OBSE as a lens for interpreting felt trust, which has implications for their work engagement and subsequent task performance and work‐to‐home conflict. In Study 1 (a multi‐wave survey in the USA), we found that employees who had higher (lower) OBSE responded more positively (negatively) to felt trust with higher (lower) work engagement. In Study 2 (a cross‐lagged survey in China), we replicated the findings of Study 1 and further showed that felt trust had a positive (negative) relationship with task performance and a negative (positive) relationship with work‐to‐home conflict via work engagement among higher‐ (lower‐) OBSE employees. Our model shifts the thinking on felt trust and has implications for felt trust theory and managerial practice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digitalization and global disruptions have fundamentally changed how we approach work. Global virtual work has become increasingly widespread in recent years, often replacing or complementing traditional expatriation and international business travel. To advance our understanding of this phenomenon, we systematically reviewed the literature on global virtual work, distinguishing it into three domains: global virtual teams, distributed work, and the use of digital technologies. For each domain, we examined key actors, their objectives, underlying theories, methodologies, and findings. The first domain provides insights into the antecedents, moderators, and mediators of the effectiveness of global virtual teams. The second domain explores individual and organizational research on diverse distributed work arrangements, such as offshoring, global platforms, and global nomads. The third domain addresses the enabling and moderating roles that digital technologies play in facilitating global virtual work. Synthesizing prior research, we developed a multilevel conceptual framework that integrates inputs, processes, and outcomes of global virtual work, offering novel perspectives. We outlined promising opportunities for future research across four themes: people, technology, context, and time. Additionally, we examined the practical implications of our findings for policymakers, managers, and individual workers as they navigate the evolving landscape of global virtual work.</content>

    <title>Artificial Intelligence (AI) Assistant in Online Shopping: A Randomized Field Experiment on a Livestream Selling Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Livestream selling is an innovative form of online shopping that supports real-time interactions between streamers and consumers. However, a key challenge remains: Streamers have limited capacity to answer individual inquiries, whereas shoppers expect fast, personalized responses. This study investigates whether an AI-powered streaming assistant can address this tension by providing interactive, chat-based support to help consumers access and process information. Through a large-scale randomized field experiment on a leading livestream selling platform, we find that the AI assistant increases sales by 3.00% and reduces product return rates by 12.55%. Our analysis suggests that the AI assistant helps consumers feel more informed and confident in their purchases, thereby reducing uncertainty. At the same time, the AI assistant can occasionally disrupt the consumers’ livestream experience. Overall, the benefits of uncertainty reduction outweigh the negative influence of interruptions. For platform managers and policymakers, these findings evidence the potential of AI technology to enhance online commerce. The AI assistant is particularly effective for high-uncertainty products and for streamers with large audiences, offering implications for strategic deployment. Our research provides actionable insights for integrating AI into livestream selling and other digital commerce scenarios where real-time, AI-powered support can facilitate both consumer satisfaction and business growth.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Regulators have increasingly mandated firms to promptly disclose material cybersecurity incidents upon discovering these incidents. We find suggestive evidence indicating that some firms manipulate the discovery date (“misreport”) of a cybersecurity incident to postpone the disclosure of the incident, as evidenced by a pronounced spike in insider sales before the reported discovery date. We also find that misreporting is more prevalent among firms with weak internal control systems, when firms face low litigation risk, and when firms have greater pressure to meet a disclosure deadline. Further, firms suspected of misreporting tend to disclose their remedial actions and assert the restoration of business, mitigating negative market reactions upon disclosure of incidents. Collectively, our results suggest that firms might strategically misreport information about a cybersecurity incident to delay disclosure to gain additional time for remedial actions, which helps them prevent exposing vulnerabilities to malicious actors and alleviate stakeholder anxiety.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01058 .</content>

    <title>Position Auctions with Endogenous Product Information: Why Live-Streaming Advertising Is Thriving</title>
    <updated>2025-03-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Live-streaming advertising in e-commerce is soaring. Both Amazon and Alibaba have employed this novel marketing model to engage consumers by sequentially exhibiting different products through live-streaming videos. In this paper, we adopt a mechanism design framework to model live-streaming e-commerce as a position auction with endogenous provision of product information. We prove that finding the mechanism that simultaneously optimizes position allocation and information provision is NP-hard. Thus, we develop several approximation algorithms. Building on the connection to the order selection problem, our analysis establishes that heuristics relying solely on product information provision can achieve up to 66.9% of the optimal revenue in the worst case. In contrast, heuristics exploiting position allocation alone may result in arbitrarily large revenue losses. We attribute the efficacy of product information provision to its enhancement of the value of ad spots in position auctions. Our findings suggest that advertising that focuses on differentiating product information—as in live-streaming e-commerce—is more lucrative than conventional position-based sponsored search. This managerial insight remains valid when accommodating multiproduct purchases with dependency or accounting for random consumer attention spans.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72201234, 72192805], the Hong Kong Research Grants Council [Grants 16211619, 16502219, 16212821, 16501722, C6032-21G], and the Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Mathematical Foundations for Artificial Intelligence [Grant 2023B1212010001].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.01299 .</content>

    <title>Do Managers Successfully Shop for Auditors Who Allow Them to Opportunistically Report Positive News? Evidence from Accounting Estimates</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior auditor shopping literature examines managers’ attempts to opportunistically underreport negative news by finding auditors who will allow them to avoid negative audit opinions or underreport goodwill impairments or financial misstatements. We advance this literature by examining management attempts to opportunistically report positive news, as captured by income-increasing changes in accounting estimates. Adapting a previous framework, we find that, ex ante, managers are more (less) likely to dismiss their auditor if it increases (decreases) the expected likelihood of reporting income-increasing changes in accounting estimates (POSCHGs). We also find that, ex post, following auditor dismissals, the frequency and magnitude of POSCHGs increase, and companies reporting POSCHGs are more likely to restate earnings, receive Securities and Exchange Commission comment letters related to estimates, meet or beat earnings targets, and less likely to receive going concern opinions or violate debt covenants. Placebo tests show that none of the above results hold for income-decreasing changes in estimates. Finally, we identify several institutional factors that constrain managers’ ability to shop for lenient auditors, including the quality of the successor auditor and strong corporate governance. Collectively, our findings are consistent with managers successfully shopping for auditors who allow them to opportunistically report positive news following auditor dismissals.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05299 .</content>

    <title>Towards the Integration of Precision Medicine in Psychiatric Care Delivery: Evaluating the Impact of Clinical Guidelines on Drug‐Related Adverse Events</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the immense potential of precision medicine to revolutionize healthcare, its integration into routine clinical practice remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the impact of Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines, which provide synthesized evidence and pharmacogenetics‐based drug dosing recommendations, on the delivery of psychiatric care enabled by precision medicine. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the effect of CPIC guidelines on serious drug‐related adverse events and explore how drug characteristics related to therapeutic uncertainty, namely drug age and drug label warning, moderate this effect. Our findings suggest that the availability of CPIC guidelines is associated with almost a 25% decrease in serious drug‐related adverse events in the context of psychiatric care delivery enabled by precision medicine. Furthermore, we find that the presence of drug label warning, as FDA‐endorsed negative news on pharmacogenetics‐related drug use, enhances the effect of CPIC guidelines and is associated with a further decrease in serious drug‐related adverse events. Post hoc analysis reveals that CPIC guidelines with high strength of evidence are associated with a significant decrease in serious drug‐related adverse events, while no such effect is observed for guidelines with low strength of evidence. These findings contribute to the nascent literature on integrating precision medicine into routine clinical practice, highlighting the consequential role of clinical guidelines in improving the effectiveness of psychiatric care delivery for individual patients enabled by precision medicine. In addition, by demonstrating how the development and implementation of robust clinical guidelines are central to minimizing serious drug‐related adverse events, the findings have policy implications for minimizing the downside risks of psychiatric care delivery.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Theory posits that when managers anticipate excess capacity, averageqbecomes a biased estimator of marginalqas the potential for underutilizing new capital reduces the marginal benefit of investing. After correcting for this source of measurement error, the explanatory power of Tobin'sqsubstantially improves in time‐series and cross‐sectional regressions as well as in out‐of‐sample tests. These findings, together with a secular erosion in capacity utilization, help explain why corporate investment rates have been declining for decades despite averageqincreasing significantly. Our analysis indicates that economic rigidities have contributed to the persistent erosion in capacity utilization.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For endogenous shaping to be recognized as an evolutionary process that helps explain the co‐evolution of firms and their environment, theories on shaping need to provide a direct link between the endogenously introduced modifications and the evolutionary trajectory of actors in the industry. Integrating insights from the sensemaking literature into the evolutionary perspective on shaping, we establish this link and identify evolutionary feedback—the response of market actors to endogenous modifications—as a distinct feature in the shaping process. To advance toward more generalized theorizing on the mechanisms of the shaping process, we ground our theoretical insights in a real‐life case by conducting a history‐friendly study of endogenous shaping and evolutionary feedback in the photovoltaic cell industry.Managerial SummaryUnderstanding how firms actively shape their environment is essential for explaining industry evolution. This study highlights the need for theories on shaping to establish a link between shapers' modifications to the industry environment and the evolutionary trajectory of firms. By integrating sensemaking insights into the evolutionary economics perspective on shaping, we provide this link and demonstrate that evolutionary feedback—market actors' responses to endogenous changes—is a distinctive feature of the shaping process. We demonstrate the shaping process and evolutionary feedback in the photovoltaic cell industry. Our findings illustrate how endogenous modifications to the industry environment triggered evolutionary feedback. This research gives managers a deeper understanding of how their strategic decisions can influence evolutionary trajectories, highlighting the importance of evolutionary feedback in this process.</content>

    <title>“Descended from Immigrants and Revolutionists:” How Family History Shapes Immigration Policymaking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does family history matter for policymaking in democracies? Linking members of Congress to the census, we observe countries of birth for members, their parents, and their grandparents, allowing us to measure ancestry for the politicians in office when U.S. immigration policy changed dramatically, from closing the border in the 1920s to reshaping admittance criteria in the 1960s. We find that legislators descended from immigrant parents or grandparents support more permissive immigration legislation. They are also less likely to speak negatively about immigration in speeches before Congress. A regression discontinuity design analyzing close elections, which addresses district-level selection and holds district composition constant, confirms our results on roll call voting and speech. Efforts to account for selection into immigration—such as comparing international immigrants to domestic migrants and exploiting variation in restrictive legislation targeting specific regions of origin—further confirm the relationship between family immigration experience and more permissive stances on immigration policy. We then explore mechanisms, finding support for in-group identity in connecting family history with policymaking. MCs name their children in ways that express immigrant identity, and immigrant-descended MCs discuss immigration using more personal frames, emphasizing family over economic considerations. Our findings illustrate the important role of personal background in legislative behavior in democratic societies, even on major and controversial topics like immigration, and suggest how experiences transmitted from previous generations can inform lawmakers’ views.</content>

    <title>Reject or Protect? Corrective Action in Response to Women’s vs. Men’s Reports of Workplace Abuse</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations encourage employees to report abusive behavior as such reports are believed to facilitate corrective action against transgressors. However, there are competing perspectives on whether reports made by women (versus men) will facilitate corrective action. On the one hand, a dominant stream of research suggests that reports made by women are often ignored and disregarded because women are not seen as credible. On the other hand, an emerging stream of research suggests that third parties will see reports made by women as serious and important. To reconcile these perspectives, we draw on aversive discrimination theory, which hints that the degree of corroboration about abuse plays a key role. That is, under situations of low corroboration, third parties are unlikely to take corrective action when women (versus men) make reports, but under situations of high corroboration, third parties are equally or even more likely to take corrective action when women (versus men) make reports. We additionally theorize and find that corroboration is particularly influential when the reporter’s general credibility is not established. Our empirical package includes six complementary studies: an archival data set of U.S. Government employees and five preregistered experiments.Funding: For financial assistance, we thank the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [Junior Faculty Development Award].</content>

    <title>Designing AI-Based Work Processes: How the Timing of AI Advice Affects Diagnostic Decision Making</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although clinical artificial intelligence (AI) systems can augment medical diagnosis decisions by providing competent second opinions, how to effectively integrate AI into routine diagnostic processes, such as when to present AI advice to human physicians, remains largely unexplored. Therefore, our research experimentally examines how the timing of AI advice affects diagnostic decision making using a think-aloud approach. Physicians perform medical diagnoses under three conditions: ex post advice (AI advice given after an initial diagnosis), ex ante advice (AI advice given concurrently with clinical information), and a control condition (no AI advice). Our results indicate that the timing of AI advice significantly affects diagnostic accuracy and calibration, with the ex post advice condition yielding the best performance and the control condition the worst. We then conduct several analyses to disentangle the underlying mechanism. We reveal that the superior diagnostic quality in the ex post advice condition can be attributed to more thorough clinical information processing and more active cognitive engagement with AI’s reasoning rationale. As a result, participants in the ex post advice condition are more capable of differentiating correct from incorrect AI advice than those in the ex ante advice condition. Additionally, they benefit more from high-quality AI advice that contradicts their initial diagnoses. To gain additional insights, we estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects based on physician and clinical case characteristics. Our findings underscore the importance of presenting AI advice at appropriate times during routine diagnostic processes to achieve successful decision augmentation with AI advice.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: This work was supported by the National University of Singapore [Grants Dean Strategic Fund - Health Informatics (HIIOT)/E and NSCP/ N-171-000-499-001] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72301279].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01454 .</content>

Exploiting cross-regional variation in H-1B labor flows based on historical immigrant enclaves, we find that firms in regions that attract more H-1B workers concentrate their investments in the quarter after uncertainty about visa access is resolved by the H-1B lottery. Consistent with a skilled labor uncertainty channel, we find that the investment spikes are confined to industries where invested capital cannot be easily redeployed, to firms that cannot easily find domestic substitutes for lost H-1B workers, and to firms that cannot easily arrange alternative employment visas for their foreign employees.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: S.-J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We argue that war as a phenomenon deserves more focused attention in management. First, we highlight why war is an important and relevant area of inquiry for management scholars. We then integrate scattered conversations on war in management studies into a framework structured around three building blocks – (a) the nature of war from an organizational viewpoint, (b) the actors involved in war and (c) war's contextual factors. This framework provides a roadmap to identify pressing questions that management scholars can address, thus laying the foundations of a programmatic theory for analysing war as a specific area of inquiry. We especially emphasize the recursive relationship between war and management theory, demonstrating how they can mutually inform each other. Finally, we highlight empirical challenges and offer specific recommendations to guide future management research on war. Aiming to stimulate a new scholarly conversation, this paper contributes to establishing a forward‐looking research agenda that can help management scholars problematize key issues in the analysis of war.</content>

    <title>Strategic Scientific Disclosure: Evidence from the Leahy–Smith America Invents Act</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of technological competition on voluntary innovation disclosure around the enactment of the Leahy–Smith America Invents Act of 2011 (“AIA”). The AIA moves the US patent system from the first‐to‐invent to first‐inventor‐to‐file system and induces a patent race that increases technological competition. Firms that are slow to file a patent are disadvantaged in this race. We find that focal firms with lagging patent classes strategically increase scientific publications in their lagging technology areas in an attempt to block competitors from obtaining a patent. This effect is more pronounced in technology areas where the firm has better information about their relative competitive position (proxied by greater inventor mobility), in technology classes with constraints on increasing patent filing timeliness (proxied by fewer experienced attorneys), and areas characterized by more intense competition. We find that the peers of firms with lagging classes experience greater patent filing rejections for lack of novelty and obviousness reasons after the AIA, suggesting that strategic scientific disclosure is effective.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Researchers constantly face challenging new phenomena that warrant study. Although we do a remarkable job of studying these phenomena, we continue to miss a big opportunity to learn from these findings in ways that can help future work. This article calls for researchers to re-think common major research processes to abstract principles that can lead to more cumulative knowledge. Specifically, this paper suggests change related to four research activities—defining the problem, anchoring to prior research, seeking novelty, and reporting practices.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper contributes to sustainable HRM theory, policy, and practice by applying and extending systems theory. A framing is developed and applied by triangulating data from 85 interviews with workers, managers, and other stakeholders (e.g., unions, employer representatives, charities) in adult social care, along with qualitative and quantitative secondary data sources. The findings highlight three main (un)sustainable HRM challenges shaped by inconsistencies between employment in the public and independent sectors:constrained system resources,disconnected career structures, anduneven voice patterns. The article contributes to HR theory by re‐framing “(un)sustainable HRM” to include how actors are constrained and/or supported by multi‐level relationships between systems and sub‐systems. The research advances policy and practice by proposing how more sustainable HRM approaches could be implemented.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Destructive entrepreneurship is an important research topic because it challenges the frequent implicit assumption that all entrepreneurship is “good.” Recent scholarly interest has been directed toward destructive entrepreneurship from various perspectives, including economics, psychology, and business ethics. This article offers a comprehensive review of the literature on destructive entrepreneurship. We begin with a definition of destructive entrepreneurship, distinguishing it from seemingly similar constructs, such as unproductive entrepreneurship. We organize the fragmented studies into a multilevel model highlighting what we know about destructive entrepreneurship. This study also reveals potential holes in this framework that future research can fill.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conducted a three-step replication of Davidsson and Honig’s study on the roles of human and social capital in venture creation processes. First, we attempted an exact replication to rule out mistakes and questionable manipulations influencing the original results. Second, we included the initial stage of development as an additional control variable, reflecting on updates suggested in later research. Third, we extended the original analyses using a sample from a different spatiotemporal context, enhancing theoretical generalizability. We largely validate D&amp;H’s findings, highlight the importance of modeling initial entrepreneurial processes, and emphasize the underappreciated complexities and value of replication studies.</content>

    <title>Systemizing Entrepreneurial Metacognition: Thinking About the Past and Future</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This review of the entrepreneurial metacognition literature systematizes the existing literature. Metacognition is vital for entrepreneurs to sense, act, and mobilize cognitive resources under uncertainty. Despite the rapidly growing stream of metacognitive research in entrepreneurship, indicating that the topic is promising and emerging, these bits of knowledge still need to be brought together to provide a big picture of where we have been to explore where we can go. Our review addresses this need by analyzing the literature on entrepreneurial metacognition. We define entrepreneurial metacognition as the mental activities of generating self-awareness and monitoring and controlling one’s cognition about identifying potential opportunities, creating a new venture, and/or managing a new venture. The inductive results reveal five attributes that reflect the essence of entrepreneurial metacognition: (a) adaptive cognition, (b) metaheuristics, (c) self-regulated cognition, (d) cultural adaptation, and (e) metacompetencies. We address definitional issues and empirical patterns, synthesize the attributes of entrepreneurial metacognition, and present a model that links entrepreneurial metacognition’s antecedents and outcomes to advance future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why do migrants return home and start businesses? Research on this multistage phenomenon—that is, return followed by entrepreneurship—is fragmented, reflecting different scholarly approaches and reasons migrants return and start businesses (or not). We systematically review 80 papers addressing aspects of returnee entrepreneurship and organize findings into a two-stage process model grounded in three levels of analysis—institutional, social, and individual. Our model contributes by providing a parsimonious way to understand returnee entrepreneurship and describe what has been learned. We also contribute a research agenda to help entrepreneurship scholars leverage what is known about entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial processes to address critical unanswered questions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How new family CEOs use the structural setup they initially find to foster post-succession change in their family firms remains a theoretical and practical puzzle. Building on strategic change and family succession insights, we draw upon 74 interviews from 43 intra-family CEO successions to employ a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. We reveal three change-enabling solutions (authority, empowerment, and alignment) and develop a model of how new family CEOs navigate different structural setups. We add configurational insights to strategic change research in entrepreneurial organizations such as family firms, extend knowledge on new CEO power, and provide contingency factors to the role of new CEO distance.</content>

    <title>‘Bad’ Oil, ‘Worse’ Oil and Carbon Misallocation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Not all barrels of oil are created equal: their extraction varies in both private cost and carbon intensity. Leveraging a comprehensive micro-dataset on world oil fields, alongside detailed estimates of carbon intensities and private extraction costs, this study quantifies the additional emissions and costs from having extracted the ’wrong’ deposits. We do so by comparing historical deposit-level supplies to counterfactuals that factor in pollution costs, while keeping annual global consumption unchanged. Between 1992 and 2018, carbon misallocation amounted to at least 11.00 gigatons of CO2-equivalent, incurring an environmental cost evaluated at $2.2 trillion (US$2018). This translates into a significant supply-side ecological debt for major producers of high-carbon oil. Looking forward, we estimate the gains from making deposit-level extraction socially optimal at about 9.30 gigatons of CO2-equivalent evaluated at $1.9 trillion along a future aggregate demand pathway coherent with the objective of net-zero emissions in 2050, and document unequal reserve stranding across oil nations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do global value chain (GVC) linkages modify countries’ incentives to impose import protection? Are these linkages important determinants of trade policy in practice? We develop a new approach to modeling tariff setting with GVCs, in which optimal policy depends on the nationality of value-added content embedded in home and foreign final goods. Theory predicts that discretionary tariffs will be decreasing in the domestic content of foreign-produced final goods and the foreign content of domestically-produced final goods. Using data for 14 countries between 1995 and 2015, we show that governments set lower tariffs and curb their use of temporary trade barriers where GVC linkages are strongest, consistent with theory. Turning to quantitative model counterfactuals, we find that severing GVC linkages would lead to the disappearance of tariff preferences. Further, targeted policies to decouple China from GVCs would increase the optimal tariff set by G7 countries on Chinese exports.</content>

    <title>Organizational Culture, Innovation, and Competitive Performance: A Multilevel Dynamic Model</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a dynamic evolutionary model of innovation culture and its organizational effects at three levels. At the frontline level, informal bottom-up innovation ideas are driven by unplanned interactions governed by cultural norms, as frontline employees sort themselves into idea generator or implementor behaviors. Management cannot directly control innovation interactions and thus culture, but it can imperfectly nudge it by influencing a sharing norm at the second level. At the third level, the culture influences the innovation performance and productivity of the firm and is thus relevant for the organization’s competitiveness. This modeling approach disentangles how top-down strategy interacts with implicit frontline dynamics of cultural evolution, in the context of innovation. Unguided culture does not lead to maximum firm performance. Management guidance may or may not improve performance, and industry competition may select higher-performing cultures, which then spread through the industry under some circumstances. We characterize under which conditions management has a strong influence on culture and performance and under which conditions performance is driven more by forces outside of management’s control.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05087 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present evidence that loan allocations and loan terms are closely linked to the strength of social connections between bank and borrower regions. Lending increases with social connectedness, particularly in the presence of strong screening incentives. If connectedness is high, banks discriminate between borrowers more, the terms of originated loans are more borrower friendly, and loan performance is better. Furthermore, social connectedness is associated with higher bank profitability and with lending-related increases in borrower-region GDP growth and employment. Our results suggest that lending barriers decrease with social connectedness, which helps our understanding of geographic lending patterns and regional economic disparities.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present a model rationalizing the economic value of digital tokens for launching peer-to-peer platforms. By using the blockchain to transparently distribute tokens before the platform launches, a token sale overcomes later coordination failures between the platform’s users. This result follows from forward induction reasoning, under which the costly and observable action of token acquisition credibly communicates the intent to participate on the platform. Our framework demonstrates the applications of digital tokens to entrepreneurship, and offers guidance for both practitioners and regulators. (JEL C72, C73, L26, D85, G23)</content>

    <title>Beefing IT Up for Your Investor? Engagement with Open Source Communities, Innovation, and Startup Funding: Evidence from GitHub</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the engagement of nascent firms with open source communities and its implications for innovation and attracting funding. To do so, we link data on 160,065 U.S. startups from Crunchbase to their activities on the open source software development platform GitHub. In a matched sample of firms with and without GitHub activities, difference-in-differences models reveal a substantial increase in the likelihood of being funded after early stage startups engage with open source communities on GitHub. This relationship is weaker for firms that employ GitHub for internal development only. Startups developing novel technologies tend to benefit more from engaging with open source communities, unlike those in highly competitive environments. This heterogeneity highlights a potential trade-off between engaging with open source communities and appropriability. To provide insight regarding mechanisms, we classify startups’ technology use-cases on GitHub using machine learning and exploit data on product launches. Our results from these additional analyses support the notion that one important channel potentially driving our findings is the access to external knowledge for technology development provided by open source communities. Engaging with these communities may thereby aid startups in innovating and creating a (minimum) viable product.Funding: A. Conti and C.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a unified framework to examine the implications of two primary approaches to strategic decision making under uncertainty: designing and shaping future scenarios vis-à-vis testing theories about future scenarios. We conducted a three-arm randomized controlled trial involving 308 early stage entrepreneurs, dividing them into three groups—design-based training, theory-based training, and a control group—and tracked them over approximately 1.5 years. Our findings reveal that both approaches reduce the need for information in decision making and lead to higher commitment rates. The design-based approach encourages action despite negative beliefs, resulting in less frequent and later project termination. In contrast, the theory-based approach promotes a more conservative termination rule, leading to earlier and more frequent project abandonment. Although the theory-based approach is associated with higher average performance upon survival, the design-based approach fosters breakthroughs for decision makers. In sum, the design-based approach is well-suited for innovative ventures that gather information to shape their environment, whereas the theory-based approach is optimal for pursuing high performance under lower degrees of uncertainty.Funding: The research leading to these results has received funding from the Italian Ministry for Education, “Entrepreneurs as Scientists: When and How Start-ups Benefit from a Scientific Approach to Decision Making” project [Grant PRIN 2017, Prot. 2017PM7R52, CUP J44I20000220001].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18245 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A project involves several participants—including clients, contractors, and subcontractors—that work concurrently on multiple projects and allocate resources among them. This interdependency creates a network of otherwise-unrelated projects. We map the network of U.S. government projects involving over 150,000 participants. We show that a seemingly localized disruption, affecting only one project site, eventually causes delays across unrelated projects. This is because participants opportunistically reallocate resources into disrupted projects, at the expense of other projects, triggering a domino effect of further reallocations in the network. Thus, the costs of on-site disruptions end up being shared by multiple participants in the network, rather than being fully absorbed by the affected project. Performance-based incentives, which reward contractors for timeliness, exacerbate these externalities by encouraging self-interested resource reallocation.This paper was accepted by Karan Girotra, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [Grant RGPIN-2017-04523].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01574 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study explores how organizational contexts, system design, and individual differences shape employees’ use of enterprise systems (ESs) and their impact on job outcomes. By examining leadership styles (transactional versus transformational), support structures (impersonal versus personal), and system characteristics (modularity and complexity), we highlight the role of employees’ situational regulatory focus (prevention versus promotion) in determining routine and innovative use of ES. Our findings show that leadership and support structures affect ES usage through employees’ regulatory focus, with transactional leadership and impersonal support fostering routine use and transformational leadership and personal support encouraging innovative use. System modularity enhances the relationship between prevention focus and routine use, whereas complexity strengthens the link between promotion focus and innovative use but weakens the relationship between prevention focus and routine ES use. Both routine and innovative ES use influence the employees’ job outcomes, including job performance and satisfaction. For organizations, this means that effective change management and ES design should align with employees’ regulatory focus and leadership strategies to maximize system adoption and improve performance. This study offers practical insights for designing more effective ES implementation strategies and tailoring support to boost employee engagement and outcomes.</content>

    <title>Banks, Low Interest Rates, and Monetary Policy Transmission</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study how the secular decline in interest rates affects banks' intermediation spreads and credit supply. Following a permanent decrease in rates, bank lending may rise initially but contracts in the long run. As lower rates compress deposit spreads even well above the zero lower bound, banks' retained earnings, equity, and lending fall until loan spreads have risen enough to offset the reduction in deposit spreads. A higher inflation target can support bank lending at the cost of higher liquidity premia. I find support for the model's predictions in U.S. aggregate and bank‐level data.</content>

    <title>Intrahousehold Disagreement about Macroeconomic Expectations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper highlights the simple fact that households typically consist of multiple members who may hold divergent views, a fact that existing approaches to measuring and modeling household macroeconomic expectations largely abstract from. Using unique data on the macroeconomic expectations of both spouses, I document substantial intrahousehold disagreement about inflation, economic recessions, and stock market returns. I further show that household asset allocation decisions are shaped by disagreement between spouses about future stock returns, and a preregistered randomized survey experiment confirms the causal impact of such disagreement on portfolio choice.</content>
