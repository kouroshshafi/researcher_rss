    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on HR attributions has received a considerable amount of attention in the study of employee perceptions of human resource management (HRM). This increased attention is based on the premise that employee attributions aboutwhycertain HR practices are implemented significantly influence employee outcomes. In this study, we review and meta‐analytically examine the relationships between two major types of HR attributions (i.e., commitment‐ and control‐focused) and various employee outcomes (i.e., employee vitality and engagement, work attitudes, and job performance). We also test several boundary conditions (e.g., the target of HR attributions) that may influence these relationships using multi‐level meta‐regression analysis. In addition, we meta‐analytically examine the relationships between two major HR attributions and their key antecedent—employee‐perceived high‐performance work systems (HPWS). Using the meta‐analytic data, we perform a path analysis to test a theory‐driven model that links employee‐perceived HPWS to commitment‐focused and control‐focused HR attributions and, ultimately, employee outcomes. We then conduct a general dominance analysis to compare the relative importance of employee‐perceived HPWS and the two types of HR attributions. As a supplementary analysis, we meta‐analyze the impact of demographic variables in shaping commitment‐ and control‐focused HR attributions. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and empirical implications of our findings, along with future research directions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document political sentiment effects on U.S. inventors. Democratic inventors are more likely to patent (relative to Republicans) after the 2008 election of Obama but less likely after the 2016 election of Trump. These effects are at least twice as strong among politically active Democrats and are present even within firms and within firm×technology. We also show that partisans tend to cluster in technologies (e.g., Democrats in Biotechnology and Republicans in Weapons), so that sentiment effects aggregate to more patents in the technologies dominated by the winning party.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study collusion among firms against imperfectly monitored environmental regulation. Firms increase variable profits by violating regulation and reduce expected noncompliance penalties by violating jointly. We consider a case of three German automakers colluding to reduce the effectiveness of emissions control technology. By estimating a structural model of the European automobile industry from 2007 to 2018, we find that collusion lowers expected noncompliance penalties substantially and increases buyer and producer surplus. Due to increased pollution, welfare decreases by € 1.57–5.57 billion. We show how environmental policy design and antitrust play complementary roles in preventing noncompliance.</content>

    <title>Policy Learning with Competing Agents</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this IssueHow to allocate limited resources when people compete for them?Data-driven decision rules are increasingly used to allocate limited resources. However, in domains such as college admissions and job hiring, these policies can be gamed and may perform poorly when people can strategically change their behavior and compete for the resource. Given a fixed selection criterion for scoring individuals, competition causes the threshold for receiving the resource to oscillate and change over time. As a concrete example, the median SAT score of an accepted student at a university can evolve over time because of competition. In “Policy Learning with Competing Agents,” Stanford researchers Roshni Sahoo and Stefan Wager demonstrate that this process can stabilize and reach an equilibrium. They develop an algorithm based on a local experimentation scheme to learn data-driven decision rules that maximize social welfare in the presence of competition.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using gender to identify analyst groups, we examine whether in-group bias affects the behavior of sell-side equity analysts and the information dissemination process. We find that analysts hold more optimistic and less accurate earnings expectations for firms with same-gender CEOs, where in-group bias is stronger among men. Greater exposure to out-of-group individuals weakens in-group bias, and the bias is also weaker among analysts located in U.S. states with greater gender equality. Group definitions based on race/ethnicity and name similarity yield similar results. These findings are robust and unlikely to reflect selective information access or various selection effects.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01467 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Lending relationships matter for firm financing. In a model of debt dynamics, we study how lending relationships are formed and how they impact the joint choice of leverage and debt maturity, thereby rationalizing recent empirical findings and generating new predictions. In the model, lending relationships evolve through repeated interactions between firms and debt investors. Stronger lending relationships lead firms to adopt higher leverage ratios, issue longer term debt, and raise funds from nonrelationship lenders via syndicated loans or bonds issues when relationship quality is sufficiently high. Debt contracts involving nonrelationship investors have longer maturity than those exclusively issued to relationship investors.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the Swiss Finance Institute, the Danish Finance Institute, and the Center for Financial Frictions [Grant DNRF102].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02415 .</content>

    <title>Financial Reporting Regulation in the Laboratory: A Case on Earnings Management</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a controlled laboratory experiment, we examine how financial reporting regulations—limits on earnings management and auditing—affect disclosure quality and market efficiency. Our findings indicate that a tight limit and the possibility of an audit enhance the informativeness of earnings disclosures, leading to improved pricing efficiency while a weak limit deteriorates disclosure quality and pricing efficiency. Financial reporting regulations enhance disclosure quality via both constraining earnings management practices and inducing signaling behavior. Auditing more effectively boosts social welfare by suppressing manipulation, whereas limits trigger overinvestment in costly signal. Our results also shed light on previously contradictory empirical findings regarding financial reporting regulations.This paper was accepted by Marie Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: Y.

    <title>Behind Emerging Market Firms’ Internationalization, Diversification, and Innovation: A Geographic Relational Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The internationalization of emerging market firms (EMFs) has attracted substantial research attention. Yet, how EMFs engage in diversification and innovation during internationalization remains underexplored. Drawing insights from a geographic relational perspective, we perform a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) on a sample of EMFs. Our findings suggest that EMFs can choose from multiple equifinal internationalization pathways to capture growth opportunities in diversification and/or innovation. These new insights emphasize that achieving diversification or innovation requires a combination of organizational contextuality, international path dependence, and geographic practice attributes. We further develop a taxonomy of five EMFs’ geographic relational configurations for diversification and/or innovation: entrenching specialist, niche explorer, global adapter, transnational agent, and strategic aspirant. Overall, by unleashing the power of configurational analysis, this paper reveals what is behind the intriguing internationalization of EMFs with a focus on diversification and innovation.</content>

    <title>Mitigating ingroup bias in regulatory firms: The role of inspector professionalism</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article adopts the lens of ingroup bias to study why regulatory firms tasked with enforcing regulatory compliance may underperform in their duties. We theorize that ingroup bias can lead regulatory agents to grant unwarranted trust to ingroup clients with whom they share salient characteristics, resulting in less stringent inspections for these clients compared to outgroup clients. We further examine how this effect is moderated by inspectors' professionalism, a human capital dimension reflecting an individual's engagement with their profession and internalization of its norms and standards. Using a difference‐in‐differences approach on micro‐data tracking 86 inspectors across 24,650 inspections of 462 vessels at a marine inspection firm, we find compelling evidence of ingroup bias and show that inspectors' professionalism mitigates its impact on regulatory enforcement stringency.</content>

    <title>Measuring Misreporting Incentives and Severity</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose an empirical measure of the types of financial misreporting based on misreporting incentives. We identify three distinct types: (1) misreporting driven by top executives’ wealth pursuits, (2) misreporting induced by capital market pressure, and (3) misreporting by subordinates due to inadequate management oversight. Our measure is developed by conducting a detailed analysis of the textual data from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases. We also provide rigorous empirical validations. Additionally, we create a composite misreporting severity score that incorporates the three misreporting incentives. Using our measure of misreporting incentives, we help reconcile previous mixed findings on the link between equity incentives and financial misreporting. Furthermore, in predicting market reactions to misreporting, our misreporting severity score outperforms a measurement that does not integrate misreporting incentives. Our measures can be practical tools for investigating a wide range of research questions related to the causes and consequences of financial misreporting.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1 [Grants RG101/22 and RG59/17].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00160 .</content>

    <title>From the Boardroom to the Jobsite: Female Board Representation and Workplace Safety</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Contributing to emerging research on corporate governance and operations management, our study examines the connection between board diversity and workplace safety. We propose that boards with a higher representation of female directors prioritize and thus enhance workplace safety due to women's distinct social‐cognitive perspectives on stakeholders, risk avoidance, and regulatory compliance. We also consider two conditions that may strengthen the relationship between female board representation and workplace safety: (1) the power of the female directors on the board, which may cause them to speak out more, and cause others to heed their perspectives; (2) accountability pressures faced by the board, which may increase board member epistemological motivation (the willingness to invest effort to fully understand the board's tasks and decisions being made). Analyzing a unique dataset that covers 1442 firm‐year observations across 266 firms, we show that female board representation improves workplace safety when women have more power and when boards face greater accountability pressures. In an empirical extension, we examine how the representation of racial/ethnic minority directors impacts workplace safety and the synergistic effect of female and minority board representation. Our findings deepen our understanding of how board diversity interacts with situational factors to influence operational outcomes.</content>

    <title>Contending with Perceived Legitimacy Tensions: Impact Investing in Pluralistic Institutional Environments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study advances our understanding of new venture legitimacy and resource acquisition by broadening the epistemological scope of our theory to be inclusive of non‐Western contexts. We conducted a qualitative study of entrepreneurs from India, Kenya, and Mexico seeking impact investments from Western impact investors to better understand how entrepreneurs in non‐Western contexts contend with perceived legitimacy tensions that arise when pursuing financial resources from non‐local investors. In contrast to the prevailing assumption that non‐Western entrepreneurs are resource‐constrained and adhere to existing strategies to seek legitimacy from financial resource providers, we find that such entrepreneurs perceive their local institutional environment to have important non‐financial resources that impact how they seek legitimacy from financial resource providers. This study offers a novel conceptualization of new venture legitimation by acknowledging non‐Western and Western institutional environments as important considerations in how entrepreneurs navigate legitimacy with both financial and non‐financial audiences over time.</content>

    <title>International contraction for the sake of international expansion</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present novel theoretical arguments suggesting that the contraction of international market presence does not only allow firms to expand their presence into new business domains, but also to resume their international market presence in the long term. We argue that when firms contract their international market presence, they spark two subsequent processes: First, they free up non‐scale free financial resources that become available for expanding into new business domains. Subsequently, such expansion creates new scale free technological knowledge resources that facilitate renewed international expansion. We find support for the existence of this novel growth trajectory in an analysis of changes in the international market presence and business segment presence of an extensive sample of public US‐based firms between 1997 and 2019.Managerial SummaryPolitical frictions, economic crises, and pandemics in the wake of the 21st century have led to volatility in the international presence of firms. In this article, we argue and show that firms that contract their international market presence can use scarce financial resources that are freed up due to such contraction to expand their business scope. In turn, business scope expansion allows these firms to create new technological knowledge resources that support resumed international expansion. Generalizing this phenomenon, we argue that, in an age where firms need to navigate international contraction and expansion, contracting international presence in the short term does not only allow the expansion of business domains but also supports the expansion of international presence in the long term. Studying an extensive sample of public US‐based firms between 1997 and 2019 lends support to this view.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Because invention activities involve accessing, identifying, and recombining relevant prior art, startups confront significant search cost and effort. Using Google Patents's 2006 digitization of inventive records as a natural experiment, we examine how digitization affects the directionality and nature of entrepreneurial innovation. We analyze 17,664 US‐based startups in the life sciences industry and find that digitization increases the quantity and quality of prior art used as innovation inputs and those of patent applications generated as innovation outputs. Moreover, our findings indicate that digitization enables startups to transcend local searches for relevant inputs and increase both their entry into new technological domains and output utility. Our study sheds new light on how digitization and its search functionalities reshape startup innovation in the digital era.Managerial SummaryGoogle Patents's 2006 digitization of inventive records transformed entrepreneurial innovation in the US Analyzing 17,664 life sciences startups, we find that digitization enhances search efficiency by alleviating constraints in accessing knowledge while boosting search effectiveness by improving inventive experimentation as online search features make identifying and utilizing relevant external knowledge timelier and more precise. Digitization enables startups to utilize greater volume, higher quality, and more diverse knowledge from prior art while also reinforcing invention outcomes, expanding into new technological domains, and generating more impactful inventions. This study highlights how digitization democratizes access to knowledge and improves search effectiveness and entrepreneurial experimentation, ultimately transforming the startup innovation landscape. Overall, digitization disproportionately benefits startups in areas geographically remote from physical knowledge repositories.</content>

    <title>How digital platforms affect local entrepreneurial activities: Evidence from the staggered entry of craigslist</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Access to markets is critical for entrepreneurial success, yet many face significant barriers. This study argues that digital platforms functioning as peer‐to‐peer marketplaces can facilitate entrepreneurial activity by improving market access for new ventures. Using the staggered entry of Craigslist into various markets, we find that Craigslist's entry increased local entrepreneurial activities, especially in low‐income regions. Moreover, individuals from lower‐income households, as well as Black and immigrant communities, were more likely to create new ventures following Craigslist's entry. Firms founded after Craigslist's entry were also smaller in size, potentially reflecting more efficient management, and primarily operated in B2C rather than B2B sectors. This study highlights how multisided platforms can empower individuals with limited market access and resources, ultimately democratizing entrepreneurship in the digital age.Managerial SummaryAccess to markets is essential for entrepreneurs to succeed, yet many face significant challenges in starting and growing their businesses. This study demonstrates how digital platforms like Craigslist can help overcome these barriers and create opportunities for more people to participate in entrepreneurship. When Craigslist expanded to new locations, it increased small business activity, particularly in low‐income areas. Individuals from lower‐income households, as well as Black and immigrant communities, were especially likely to benefit from it when starting businesses. These businesses were smaller in size, potentially indicating more efficient management and more B2C‐focused operations. This research underscores how digital platforms can make markets more accessible for traditionally disadvantaged groups, fostering a more inclusive entrepreneurial ecosystem.</content>

    <title>Political Districting to Optimize the Polsby-Popper Compactness Score with Application to Voting Rights</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When drawing political districts, important criteria include district compactness and the ability of minority groups to convert votes into seats. In litigation, compactness is usually measured via the Polsby-Popper score; however, this score has largely been absent from the operations research literature, presumably because of its nonlinear nature. In “Political Districting to Optimize the Polsby-Popper Compactness Score with Application to Voting Rights,” Belotti, Buchanan, and Ezazipour propose new mixed-integer second-order cone programs (MISOCPs) to optimize this score, enabling them to find optimally compact districts built from voting precincts. The methods are extended to find compact plans with many majority-minority districts. This is the task faced by plaintiffs in lawsuits brought under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 who must show that an alternative plan exists in which the minority group could achieve better representation. Computational experiments show that the MISCOP-based methods perform as well (or better) than state-of-the-art approaches for this task, scaling to instances with nearly 200,000 census blocks.</content>

    <title>Multi-item Online Order Fulfillment in a Two-Layer Network</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How Online Retailers Can Fulfill Orders Faster and Cheaper in Structured RDC–FDC NetworksThe global surge in online shopping has driven e-retailers to rapidly expand their warehouse networks for faster deliveries. However, this has significantly increased fulfillment costs. In the paper “Multi-item Online Order Fulfillment in a Two-Layer Network,” Zhao, Wang, and Xin explore efficient ways to reduce these costs by examining how orders are allocated among warehouses in real time. They analyze a simple “myopic” algorithm, where each order is assigned immediately to the cheapest available warehouse without considering future orders. Surprisingly, this straightforward algorithm proves effective in structured warehouse networks consisting of larger regional distribution centers (RDCs) and smaller front distribution centers (FDCs), like those operated by JD.com . This contrasts sharply with more flexible fulfillment networks such as Amazon’s, where myopic algorithms usually underperform because of more complex fulfillment options requiring more advanced real-time algorithms. The key takeaway for businesses facing uncertain demand is that a less flexible fulfillment network—such as one consisting of large RDCs and smaller FDCs—enables simple and effective allocation methods.</content>

    <title>Robustly Optimal Contracts for Agricultural Supply Chains</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Because of various factors (such as a lack of adequate statistical knowledge or data, unforeseen weather events), the yields of agricultural products often exhibit a high level of ambiguity. When facing distributional ambiguity in yields, farmers and landowners may base their contracting decisions on descriptive statistics, such as the mean and variance. To investigate how limited information could reshape optimal contract forms, we consider an agricultural supply chain in which a landowner contributes farmland and a skilled farmer exerts costly private effort to cultivate a crop. Both parties face distributional ambiguity in crop yield and employ a robust max-min decision rule. When the landowner possesses the bargaining power to draft the contract (the L model), we find that a hybrid contract of debt and equity is robustly optimal. In contrast, when the farmer possesses the bargaining power (the F model), the optimal contract could be a linear (equity) contract or a nonlinear quadratic debt contract, depending on the coefficient of variation (CV) and the landowner’s reservation profit. We use U.S. Department of Agriculture data to calibrate the model and find that, as the CV increases, the party that possesses the bargaining power tends to share more risk. We also find that when both the CV and the landowner’s reservation profit are sufficiently large, the L model induces a higher effort level; otherwise, the F model achieves better effort. Finally, we extend the model to consider various features, such as random crop price, farmer’s risk aversion and bounded crop yield.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: G.

    <title>Reshaping Corporate Boards Through Mandatory Gender Diversity Disclosures: Evidence from Canada</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study whether and how standardized gender diversity disclosure requirements affect women’s representation on corporate boards. Our analysis takes advantage of Canada’s 2014 regulation, which requires disclosures of consistent and comparable information on boards’ gender diversity policies and guidelines. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the disclosure regulation increases women’s representation on boards. The increase is more pronounced among firms with stronger shareholder oversight as proxied by ownership from environmental, social, and governance (ESG)–friendly investors, poor diversity performance preregulation, Toronto Stock Exchange index membership, and U.S. cross-listing. In addition, after the regulation, firms that make stronger diversity commitments (e.g., disclosing the adoption of written diversity policies and diversity targets) experience a higher increase in ownership by foreign ESG-friendly investors. Together, our findings suggest that standardized disclosure requirements enable shareholders to be better monitors, thereby improving board gender balance.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00509 .</content>

    <title>Insufficient Effort Responding in Management Research: A Critical Review and Future Directions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Insufficient effort responding (IER) presents a significant challenge in management research, potentially leading to flawed inferences. This review critically examines IER practices in 17 leading management journals from 2012 to 2023, highlighting inconsistencies in screening methods, cutoffs, and reporting. We find that IER screening is more prevalent in studies using online paid samples, experimental tasks, and computerized data collection. However, researchers’ IER-related practices, specifically the use of multiple detection methods, predicted IER removal rate above and beyond these study characteristics. Our review revealed that, despite increasing awareness, IER detection and reporting remain unstandardized, with varied practices across studies. While attention checks are frequently used, details about their implementation are often inadequately reported, and multiple detection methods, though recommended, are inconsistently applied. Variability in cutoffs and reliance on single-item checks raise concerns about the risk of retaining IER cases or mistakenly excluding attentive respondents. Our assessment of the impact of IER removal suggests that while it generally improves reliability and model fit, its effect can vary widely across measures and studies. We call on methodologists to resolve existing inconsistencies by developing clearer, empirically derived guidelines for IER detection and removal. We urge researchers to adopt more comprehensive and transparent reporting practices to enhance replicability and methodological rigor, with a flowchart to guide research design and method communication. This review underscores the need for a more systematic approach to IER mitigation in management research to enhance data quality and research validity.</content>

    <title>Mitigating Supply Risk with Limited Information: Emergency Supply and Responsive Pricing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the implications and interplay of emergency supply and responsive pricing—two effective strategies to mitigate supply risk—in response to yield randomness with limited distributional information. Specifically, we adopt a distribution‐free approach to study an ambiguity‐averse monopoly's joint price and production decisions given the random yield's mean and variance—arguably two of the most widely used and easy‐to‐estimate summary statistics. We derive for four models, which result from all possible combinations of the two strategies, closed‐form solutions of the optimal price and production decisions as well as the optimal profit. Through comparative analysis, we obtain several managerial insights based on the problem's parameters, including cost parameters, demand parameters, and supply variation. The firm can benefit more from pure emergency supply than from pure responsive pricing if the unit emergency purchasing cost is not larger than a certain threshold, and the strategic relation between emergency supply and responsive pricing also critically depends on the unit emergency purchasing cost as well as the type of distributional information we know about the random yield. We discuss how distributional information about mean and variance bridges the most and least variable situations of the random yield, thus establishing the gain and the limit of knowing variance.</content>

    <title>Volume Flexibility at Responsive Suppliers in Reshoring Decisions: Analysis of a Dual Sourcing Inventory Model</title>

            investigate how volume flexibility, defined by a sourcing cost premium beyond a base capacity, at a local responsive supplier impacts the decision to reshore supply. The buyer also has access to a remote supplier that is cheaper with no restrictions on volume flexibility. We show that with unit lead time difference between both suppliers, the optimal dual sourcing policy is amodified dual base‐stockpolicy with three base‐stock levelsS1f,S2f, andSs. The replenishment orders are generated by first placing a base order from the fast supplier of at mostkunits to raise the inventory position toS1f, if that is possible. After this base order, if the adjusted inventory position is still belowS2f, additional units are ordered from the fast supplier at an overtime premium to reachS2f. Finally, if the adjusted inventory position is belowSs, an order from the slow supplier is placed to bring the final inventory position toSs. Surprisingly, in contrast to single sourcing with limited volume flexibility, a more complex dual sourcing model often results in a “simpler” policy that replaces demand in each period. The latter allows analytical insights into the sourcing split between the responsive and the remote supplier. Our analysis shows how increased volume flexibility at the responsive supplier promotes the decision to reshore operations and effectively serves as a cost benefit. It also shows how investing in base capacity or additional volume flexibility act as strategic substitutes.</content>

    <title>Self-Preferencing and Search Neutrality in Online Retail Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent regulations on search neutrality prohibit retail platforms from self-preferentially prioritizing their first-party products over those of third-party sellers in consumers’ search rankings. This paper shows that, despite its good intention, search neutrality may unintendedly harm consumers and third-party sellers because of the strategic decisions of the platform and third-party sellers. In the short term, search neutrality can weaken the price competition between the platform and third-party sellers, which will hurt consumers if many of them ex ante prefer the third-party product, and can increase the platform’s profit if many consumers ex ante prefer the first-party product. In the long term, search neutrality can incentivize the platform to preempt the entry of third-party sellers if their entry cost is intermediate, further harming consumers and third-party sellers. Both unintended harms stem from two unique features of online retailing platforms: platforms personalize consumers’ search rankings, and consumers observe product prices before searching a product in depth. Alternative formulations of search neutrality, consumers’ search costs, and their product match likelihoods are considered to demonstrate the robustness of the main results.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Conflict of Interest Statement: All authors certify that they have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with any financial interest or nonfinancial interest in the subject matter or materials discussed in this manuscript.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01795 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a comprehensive database of corporate relocation events in the United States from 1994 to 2017, we investigate the impact of headquarters relocation on the local economy by examining its spillover effects on the housing market. We find that headquarters relocation into a district at zip code level leads to 10% higher housing price growth. We also document a temporal spillover effect whereby housing prices increase one year before the relocation and rise further until two years afterward and a significant spatial spillover effect of corporate relocation on nearby zip codes’ housing markets up to 15 miles. We show the positive spillover effect on housing price growth is more pronounced for relocating firms with larger employee sizes and economic bases. We further find local economic spillover and agglomeration economies associated with corporate relocation. Overall, our study indicates that corporate relocation exhibits a significant impact on the local housing market.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: The project received research grant from the Alrov Institute for Real Estate Research.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.01819 .</content>

    <title>Optimizing Offline Product Design and Online Assortment Policy: Measuring the Relative Impact of Each Decision</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Revenue management decisions often involve both offline and online decisions. Offline decisions are made first and establish the broad and long-term operational context in which online decisions are frequently and repeatedly made, often in real time. We consider a joint optimization of offline and online decisions. Specifically, we examine a setting in which the offline decision concerns the selection of product-design characteristics (e.g., price, capacity, return eligibility, and other characteristics) and the online decision concerns the dynamic assortment optimization over a selling season. Our formulation has many applications, including optimizing products’ return eligibility and determining product discounts, and a key feature of our model is its explicit consideration of complex return dynamics and accompanying financial implications. We formulate an optimization problem that combines the impact of both offline and online decisions on the expected revenue. To determine the product design, we reformulate the choice-based deterministic linear program, solve its continuous relaxation, and round the resulting solution. Using value function approximations enables us to obtain a dynamic assortment policy whose expected revenue is at least a constant fraction of the choice-based deterministic linear program. Combining these two results, we show that our approach provides an approximate solution to the joint optimization problem with performance guarantees. Numerical experiments based on real transaction data from a major U.S. retailer show that our method achieves 95%–97% effectiveness, an advantage of up to 18% over methods that disregard the interplay between offline and online decisions. This framework also yields a systematic quantitative measure of the relative importance of both offline and online decisions. Based on this measure, numerical experiments highlight the crucial role of product design, accounting for 94% and 85% of the observed variation in effectiveness across various methods in applications involving volume discount and return eligibility, respectively.This paper was accepted by Victor Martinez de Albeniz, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation’s Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation [Grant 2226901].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01167 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The main contribution of this paper resides in developing a new algorithmic approach for addressing the continuous-time joint replenishment problem, termed [Formula: see text]-pairwise alignment. The latter mechanism, through which we synchronize multiple economic order quantity models, allows us to devise a purely combinatorial algorithm for efficiently approximating optimal policies within any degree of accuracy. As a result, our work constitutes the first quantitative improvement over power-of-2 policies, which have been state-of-the-art in this context since the mid-1980s. Moreover, in light of recent intractability results, by proposing an efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme for the joint replenishment problem, we resolve the long-standing open question regarding the computational complexity of this classical setting.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: This work was supported by the Israel Science Foundation [Grant 1407/20].</content>

    <title>Who Does the Talking Here? The Impact of Gender Composition on Team Interactions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze how the gender composition of teams affects team interactions. In an online experiment, we randomly assign individuals to gender-homogenous or gender-mixed teams of four. Teams meet in an audio chat room and jointly work on a team task that is gender-neutral in terms of individual productivity. By design, effects on team performance can only work through communication. We find that all-male teams communicate more than all-female teams and outperform teams of both alternative gender compositions. In mixed teams, men strongly dominate the team conversation quantitatively. Considering the ranking in terms of communication shares in mixed teams, we document that high-skilled men talk the most, followed by low-skilled men. High-skilled women talk more than low-skilled women, but much less than low-skilled men. We conclude that gender composition significantly impacts the way how teams exchange information.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [RI 1959/5-1] and Hans-Frisch-Stiftung.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03411 .</content>

    <title>Does Bank Monitoring Reduce Corporate Misreporting? Evidence from Foreign Bank Entry in China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a model of bank monitoring and borrower financial misreporting. Using the staggered liberalization of the banking sector in China as a natural experiment, we find that, consistent with the model’s prediction, entry by more efficient foreign banks reduces corporate misreporting fraud. Fraud reduction is greatest among borrowers of foreign banks, but fraud also drops among borrowers of domestic banks, suggesting a spillover effect. As predicted by the model, fraud reduction is greatest for borrowers with higher levels of fixed assets or lower levels of current assets. Our evidence suggests that improved bank monitoring reduces financial misreporting.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Funding: M.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the consequences of holding multiple accounts for payout decisions at retirement. Using proprietary data of retirees’ annuitization decisions, we find that small accounts are more likely to be cashed out. We use occupation information as a proxy for wealth to disentangle income from the multiple-accounts effect. We show that individuals with high expected wages are more likely to annuitize overall but less likely to annuitize their small accounts (comparing to individuals with low wages). A laboratory experiment and an online experimental survey (with a large representative sample) suggest that the composition of multiple accounts affects the annuitization rates via the decisions regarding small versus large accounts.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the Albertson-Waltuch Chair in Business Administration, the Kruger Center at the Hebrew University, the Think Forward Initiative, and the German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development and by funding from the Center for Agriculture, Environment and Natural Resource.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02489 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the construction of variable importance measures for multivariate responses using the theory of optimal transport. We start with the classical optimal transport formulation. We show that the resulting sensitivity indices are well-defined under input dependence, are equal to zero under statistical independence, and are maximal under fully functional dependence. Also, they satisfy a continuity property for information refinements. We show that the new indices encompass Wagner’s variance-based sensitivity measures. Moreover, they provide deeper insights into the effect of an input’s uncertainty, quantifying its impact on the output mean, variance, and higher-order moments. We then consider the entropic formulation of the optimal transport problem and show that the resulting global sensitivity measures satisfy the same properties, with the exception that, under statistical independence, they are minimal, but not necessarily equal to zero. We prove the consistency of a given-data estimation strategy and test the feasibility of algorithmic implementations based on alternative optimal transport solvers. Application to the assemble-to-order simulator reveals a significant difference in the key drivers of uncertainty between the case in which the quantity of interest is profit (univariate) or inventory (multivariate). The new importance measures contribute to meeting the increasing demand for methods that make black-box models more transparent to analysts and decision makers.This paper was accepted by Baris Ata, stochastic models and simulation.Funding: A.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this study, we provide evidence on the effects of state tax whistleblower laws. We exploit a novel 2010 amendment to New York’s False Claims Acts (FCA) that explicitly extended whistleblower incentives to corporate income tax whistleblowers. We identify treated firms (firms exposed to New York’s FCA) using establishment-level data and descriptive analyses. Using a sample of firms exposed to New York and neighboring states, we find evidence that New York’s FCA reduced state tax avoidance. In cross-sectional tests, we find that effects are increasing in firms that grant fewer employee stock options and industry regulation, consistent with deterrence increasing in employee and regulator monitoring. We also find evidence that New York’s FCA deterred federal tax avoidance, consistent with positive vertical tax externalities. Next, we focus on particular tax strategies and find evidence of a reduced probability of Double Irish tax structures, reduced relationships to tax planning banks, reduced use of special purpose vehicles, and reduced outbound tax-motivated income shifting. We also find evidence that firms with the lowest (highest) cost of relocation (1) reduced (did not change) establishment counts in New York but (2) did not change (reduced) state tax avoidance. Finally, we disentangle general ex ante deterrence from ex ante peer deterrence using hand-collected New York tax whistleblower press releases from the Attorney General. We find evidence of both types of deterrence. Overall, this study provides policy-relevant evidence on the deterrence effects of tax whistleblower laws.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: Y.

    <title>The Value of Robust Assortment Optimization Under Ranking-Based Choice Models</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a class of robust assortment optimization problems that was proposed by Farias et al. [Farias VF, Jagabathula S, Shah D (2013) A nonparametric approach to modeling choice with limited data. Management Sci. 59(2):305–322]. The goal in these problems is to find an assortment that maximizes a firm’s worst-case expected revenue under all ranking-based choice models that are consistent with the historical sales data generated by the firm’s past assortments. We establish for various settings that these robust optimization problems can either be solved in polynomial time or can be reformulated as compact mixed-integer optimization problems. To establish our results, we prove that optimal assortments for these robust optimization problems have a simple structure that is closely related to the structure of revenue-ordered assortments. We use our results to show how robust optimization can be used to overcome the risks of estimate-then-optimize and the need for experimentation with ranking-based choice models in the overparameterized regime.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.04059 .</content>

    <title>Batching and Optimal Multistage Bipartite Allocations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In several applications of real-time matching of demand to supply in online marketplaces, the platform allows for some latency to batch the demand and improve the efficiency of the resulting matching. Motivated by these applications, we study the optimal trade-off between batching and inefficiency in the context of designing robust online allocations. As our base model, we consider K-stage variants of the classic vertex-weighted bipartite b-matching in the adversarial setting, where online vertices arrive stagewise and in K batches—in contrast to online arrival. Our main result for this problem is an optimal [Formula: see text]-competitive (fractional) matching algorithm, improving the classic [Formula: see text]-competitive ratio bound known for its online variant [Mehta A, Saberi A, Vazirani U, Vazirani V (2007) Ad words and generalized online matching. J. ACM 54(5):22–es; Aggarwal G, Goel G, Karande C, Mehta A (2011) Online vertex weighted bipartite matching and single-bid budgeted allocations. Proc. 22nd Annual ACM-SIAM Sympos. Discrete Algorithms (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Philadelphia), 1253–1264]. We also extend this result to the general problem of multistage configuration allocation with free disposals [Devanur NR, Huang Z, Korula N, Mirrokni VS, Yan Q (2016) Whole page optimization and submodular welfare maximization with online bidders. ACM Trans. Econom. Comput. 4(3):1–20], which is motivated by the display advertising application in the context of video streaming platforms. Our main technique at a high level is developing algorithmic tools to vary the trade-off between “greediness” and “hedging” of the matching algorithm across stages. We rely on a particular family of convex programming–based matchings that distribute the demand in a specifically balanced way among supply in different stages while carefully modifying the balancedness of the resulting matching across stages. More precisely, we identify a sequence of polynomials with decreasing degrees to be used as strictly concave regularizers of the maximum weight–matching linear program to form these convex programs. At each stage, our fractional multistage algorithm returns the corresponding regularized optimal solution as the matching of this stage (by solving the convex program). By providing structural decomposition of the underlying graph using the optimal solutions of these convex programs and recursively connecting the regularizers together, we develop a new multistage primal-dual framework to analyze the competitive ratio of this algorithm. We further show this algorithm is optimal competitive, even in the unweighted case, by providing an upper bound instance in which no online algorithm obtains a competitive ratio better than [Formula: see text]. For the extension to multistage configuration allocation, we introduce a novel extension of our regularized convex program that provides separate regularization at different “price levels.” Despite the lack of a relevant graph decomposition in this extension, in contrast to our base model, we show how we can directly use convex duality to set up a primal-dual analysis framework for our new algorithm.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: R.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An influential line of research emphasizes that colonial legacy plays a key role in formal financial development. Can colonial legacy also shape informal finance? We investigate the impact of colonial legacy on informal financial development using a manually georeferenced data set within a credible empirical framework. In the 19th century, Europeans arbitrarily designed colonial borders that partitioned many ethnicities across multiple countries in Africa. Leveraging several spatial regression discontinuity designs across national borders and within British-French–partitioned Cameroon and a unique natural experiment where the same former British colony is compared with two otherwise similar areas with different exposures to French colonization, we discover that former British colonies today have better informal financial development than former French colonies. Exploring the channels, we find that places with a British colonial legacy maintain a style of social control that facilitates information flow, supports private enforcement and market interactions, and promotes strong legal cultures.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: C.

    <title>Don’t Fake It If You Can’t Make It: Driver Misconduct in Last-Mile Delivery</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the last two decades, last-mile delivery (LMD) firms have seen immense growth fueled by the success of e-commerce, leading to faster and cheaper deliveries. Operating on thin margins, LMD firms strive for successful first-time deliveries to avoid the financial and reputational costs of reattempts. Delivery agents (DAs) are integral to LMD efficiency, influencing customer experience, delivery success, and productivity. However, most LMD performance enhancement research focuses on process, technology, and incentives, which presume workers will conform to procedures and monitoring tools will function flawlessly. Nevertheless, in practice, DAs deviate from expected behaviors, that is, indulge in misconduct, negatively affecting delivery efficiency, often resulting in returned parcels. One of the major forms of misconduct is entering fake remarks about deliveries, wherein DAs intentionally do not deliver the parcels and provide fake reasons for it. For instance, even without reaching a delivery address, a DA remarks “customer unavailable” and records a delivery failure. In this study, we collaborated with a leading Indian LMD firm and, using instrumental variable regression, found that such misconduct leads to a spillover productivity loss. This effect reduces the next day’s successful deliveries by 1.60% and first-time-right deliveries by 1.86%. We discuss misconduct’s correlation with factors such as task complexity and offer novel insights into how opportunistic circumstances can influence worker behavior.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Funding: V.

    <title>The Impact of Peer Performance and Relative Rank on Managerial Career Attainment: Evidence from College Students</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The ranking system within academic environments may impact future professional trajectories. Examining the influence of class rank on college students’ managerial attainment is crucial for understanding some determinants of career advancement. This paper estimates the effect of a low rank in a high-performing class on the probability of college students attaining a managerial position in the future. Our data combine administrative records from a highly selective university in Brazil and employment registries. For most programs, this university divides first-year students into two classes based on their preferences and admission scores. In a regression discontinuity design, we control for students’ preferences and inherent skills by comparing the last student admitted to the high-score class (the “first class”) with the first student excluded from this class, who joins the “second class.” Results show that the last student in the first class is 10 percentage points less likely to attain a managerial position soon after graduating than a similar student in the second class. Although this effect is initially similar between genders, it diminishes for men over time while persisting for women. Overall, our study indicates that better-performing peers can hinder a student’s managerial career by lowering their relative rank in the classroom.This paper was accepted by Isabel Fernandez-Mateo, organizations.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02988 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper establishes the optimal selling mechanism when a seller can incentivize an existing buyer to refer his privately known potential buyer to participate. We identify three optimal channels for providing referral incentives. First, if the existing buyer declares that no potential buyer exists, his virtual value is penalized. Second, if the existing buyer refers the potential buyer to the seller, his virtual value is boosted. Third, in some scenarios where this carrots-and-sticks-via-virtual-value approach is insufficient for creating proper referral incentives, the existing buyer is then given a constant referral bonus for referring the potential buyer. We also provide conditions under which the optimal mechanism can be implemented using simple mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate that the conventional resale mechanism is suboptimal.This paper was accepted by Itai Ashlagi, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: H.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To understand the disruption and implications of distributed ledger technologies for financial reporting and auditing, we analyze firm misreporting, auditor monitoring and competition, and regulatory policy in a unified model. A federated blockchain for financial reporting and auditing can improve verification efficiency not only for transactions in private databases but also for cross-chain verifications through privacy-preserving computation protocols. Despite the potential benefit of blockchains, private incentives for firms and first-mover advantages for auditors can create inefficient under-adoption or partial adoption that favors larger auditors. Although a regulator can help coordinate the adoption of technology, endogenous choice of transaction partners by firms can still lead to adoption failure. Our model also provides an initial framework for further studies of the costs and implications of the use of distributed ledgers and secure multiparty computation in financial reporting, including the positive spillover to discretionary auditing and who should bear the cost of adoption.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, finance.Funding: The authors gratefully acknowledge research support from the FinTech Laboratory at J.

    <title>The Marginal Value of Cash: Structural Estimates from a Model with Financing and Agency Frictions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How much value does an additional dollar of cash create for a firm? It is generally recognized that the marginal value of cash (MVC) can either exceed or fall below one dollar. Estimates of MVC can guide corporate cash and payout policy, indicate the quality of governance, and make a firm a target for takeover or activism. Yet the existing methods of estimation lack a rigorous theoretical foundation and often provide implausibly high or low estimates. In this paper, we provide a formulation of MVC and structurally estimate the MVC based on a model that encompasses the important determinants for the choice of cash savings, including financing and agency costs. We find that firms with large cash and capital stocks have lower marginal value of cash, whereas the relationship between leverage and marginal value of cash is hump shaped. Two quasi-natural experiments validate the MVC estimates.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research indicates that narcissistic executives engage in earnings management and other negative organizational behaviors, and many studies ponder why firms hire such individuals, especially into corporate accounting positions. Utilizing a selection of terms from real-world job postings that we characterize as describing either a “Rule-Bender” or “Rule-Follower” candidate, we first conduct several validation studies which reveal that these terms vary predictably across types of job postings, that people generally agree with our categorization of these terms, and that Rule-Benders are viewed as possessing worse managerial skills but a higher proclivity for unethical behavior. We then demonstrate that narcissistic job seekers are more attracted to job postings that describe the ideal candidate using Rule-Bender terms for both general positions (Experiment 1) and senior accounting positions (Experiment 2). Finally, we examine firm characteristics that might lead professional recruiters to incorporate Rule-Bender language into Chief Accounting Officer job postings and find that Rule-Bender terms are preferred for higher-growth, higher-innovation firms (Experiment 3), and when more aggressive reporting would benefit the firm (Experiment 4). Our results suggest that recruiters’ language choices can attract Rule-Bending narcissists to firms, perhaps even in unintended circumstances.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05254 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a dynamic general equilibrium model with costly-to-short stocks and heterogeneous beliefs. Costly short sales drive a wedge between the valuation of assets that promise identical cash flows but that are subject to different trading arrangements. In particular, we show that the price of an asset is given by the risk-adjusted present value of its future cash flows, which include both dividends and an endogenous lending yield that we characterize explicitly. This valuation formula implies that stocks with low and high shorting costs should offer similar risk-return trade-off once returns are appropriately adjusted for lending revenues and thus, sheds light on recent empirical findings about the explanatory power of shorting costs in the cross-section of returns.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01887 .</content>

    <title>Social Preferences and the Informativeness of Subjective Performance Evaluations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study biases and the informativeness of subjective performance evaluations in an online experiment, testing the implications of a standard formal framework of rational subjective evaluations. In the experiment, subjects in the role of workers perform a real effort task. Subjects in the role of supervisors observe samples of the workers’ output and assess their performance. We conduct six experimental treatments varying (i) whether workers’ pay depends on the performance evaluation, (ii) whether supervisors are paid for the accuracy of their evaluations, and (iii) the precision of the information available to supervisors. Moreover, we use the exogenous assignment of supervisors to workers to investigate the association between supervisors’ social preferences and their rating quality. In line with the model of optimal evaluations, we find that ratings are more lenient and less informative when they determine bonus payments. Rewards for accuracy reduce leniency and can enhance informativeness. When supervisors have access to more detailed performance information, their ratings vary more with the performance signal and become more informative. Contrary to expectations, we do not find that more prosocial supervisors are systematically more lenient when their ratings affect workers’ payoffs. Instead, they are more diligent in their rating behavior, resulting in more accurate and informative performance evaluations.This paper was accepted by Marie Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: Funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany’s Excellence Strategy [Grant EXC 2126/1-390838866].Supplemental Material: The online supplement and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02267 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Analyzing the specifications of pricing models for the joint valuation of S&amp;P 500 and VIX options, I find that the existing models cannot adequately represent the two options markets. I introduce a new factor that controls the higher-order moments of the risk-neutral return distribution. The model I propose significantly outperforms all other alternatives, and particularly improves on the benchmark two-variance-factor model with cojumps by 23.66% in-sample and 31.64% out-of-sample. The performance analysis shows that the better fit results from improvements in the modeling of both S&amp;P 500 and VIX options, highlighting the model features that are critical for reconciling the two markets.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72233003 and 72303233].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00327 .</content>

    <title>Matching and Pricing in Ride Hailing: Wild Goose Chases and How to Solve Them</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that ride-hailing markets are prone to a matching failure (“wild goose chases”) in which high demand sets off a harmful feedback cycle of few idle drivers, high pickup times, and low earnings, drastically reducing welfare. After characterizing these failures theoretically and showing empirical evidence of their relevance, we analyze how platforms can avoid them. Raising prices brings demand back under control. Platforms can thus set a uniform high price, or they can use high “surge” pricing during high demand times while keeping prices low at other times. Some adjustments to the matching algorithm can also avoid the problem, but surge pricing performs better than them.This paper was accepted by Itai Ashlagi, revenue management and market analytics.Funding: This research was supported by the Kapnick Foundation Fellowship through a grant to the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research and by the John S. and James L.

    <title>A Dynamic Matching Mechanism for College Admissions: Theory and Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Market design provides managerial insights into the success and failure of various market institutions in allocating scarce resources. We investigate a dynamic matching mechanism used in real-world college admissions, where students share a common priority ranking. Theoretically, we prove that efficient and stable matching occurs with an arbitrarily high probability, assuming sufficient revision opportunities and rationality. This predicts that the dynamic mechanism is less stable than the deferred acceptance mechanism and less efficient than the Boston mechanism. We confirm this prediction in a low-complexity laboratory setting. However, in a high-complexity setting, the dynamic mechanism matches the stability of the deferred acceptance and the efficiency of the Boston mechanism, as both underperform in this setting. This finding indicates that the dynamic mechanism is more resilient to increased complexity. We attribute this resilience to its belief-independent characterization of rationalizable strategies. Beyond college admissions, the dynamic mechanism has potential applications in housing assignments, job allocations, and ascending auctions.This paper was accepted by Axel Ockenfels, decision analysis.Funding: B.

    <title>How Does Artificial Intelligence Shape Audit Firms?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does artificial intelligence (AI) displace auditors? We exploit the staggered hiring of AI employees at audit office locations across the United States as a proxy for the use of AI at local audit offices. The main findings are as follows. First, relative to audit offices that do not yet hire AI employees, those that do hire AI employees have a 4.3% increase in the number of auditor jobs, particularly among junior and midlevel auditors. Second, using AI is associated with an increased demand for soft skills (e.g., cognitive skills) in auditor jobs. Third, audit offices that use AI have more accurate going concern and internal control opinions. Semistructured interviews of 11 seasoned audit partners confirm that investment in AI is centralized at the national level, but the decision to deploy it often resides at the local audit office level. Notably, none of the partners believe that AI has replaced or will replace human auditors. Overall, our study—comprising both empirical and qualitative data—suggests that using AI does not replace auditors, but rather changes the skills required for these jobs and improves audit quality.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: K.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fund companies regularly send shareholder letters to their investors. We use textual analysis to investigate whether these letters’ writing style influences fund flows and whether it predicts performance and investment styles. Fund investors react to the tone and content of shareholder letters: a less negative tone leads to higher net flows. Thus, fund companies can use shareholder letters as a tactical instrument to influence flows. However, at the same time, a dishonest communication that is not consistent with the fund’s actual performance decreases flows. A positive writing style predicts higher idiosyncratic risk as well as more style bets, whereas there is no consistent predictive power for future performance.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03417 .</content>

    <title>Coopetition in Platform-Based Retailing: On the Platform’s Entry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the dynamic incentive interactions between a platform and a third-party seller over two stages, where the seller exerts product-value-enhancement effort in the first stage in anticipation of the platform’s potential entry in the second stage. Upon entry, the platform can exert effort to boost the value of the product sold by the platform, with positive spillovers to the value of the product sold by the platform. We show the existence of both the protective and the receptive regimes, characterizing the necessary and sufficient conditions for each regime. These conditions are of thresholds type with respect to the parameters including the degree of spillover, the referral rate, and the competition intensity. In the protective (receptive) regime, the seller is worse (better) off with the platform’s entry than without, thereby distorting effort downward (upward) from the first best to deter (induce) the platform’s entry to the products of intermediate value. Notably, if the spillover effect is negative, only the protective regime will arise. We also provide the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the platform’s nonentry commitment strictly improves the platform’s profits by restoring the seller’s effort to the first best, achieving the win-win outcome for both the platform and the seller.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: H.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents a theoretical framework for determining the ownership stakes held by financial investors in companies competing in the same product market, commonly referred to as the level of common ownership. In our model, these investors are primarily motivated by the anticipation of capital gains resulting from the impact of common ownership on product market competition, which enhances profitability for the firms involved. However, common ownership also undermines effective corporate governance by diminishing blockholders’ incentives to engage in value-enhancing behaviors, such as managerial monitoring. These adverse effects on corporate governance act as limiting factors, ultimately determining the equilibrium level of common ownership.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.</content>

    <title>Stress Testing Spillover Risk in Mutual Funds</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a framework to quantify the vulnerability of mutual funds to fire-sale spillover losses. We account for the first-mover incentive that results from the mismatch between the liquidity offered to redeeming investors and the liquidity of assets held by the funds. In our framework, the negative feedback loop between investors’ redemptions and price impact from asset sales leads to an aggregate change in funds’ net asset value, which is determined as a fixed point of a nonlinear mapping. We show that a higher concentration of first movers increases the aggregate vulnerability of the system as measured by the ratio between endogenous losses triggered by fund redemptions and exogenous losses caused by initial price shocks only. When calibrated to U.S. mutual funds, our model shows that, in stressed market scenarios, spillover losses are significantly amplified through a nonlinear response to initial shocks that results from the first-mover incentive. Higher spillover losses provide a stronger incentive to redeem early, further increasing fire-sale losses and the transmission of shocks through overlapping portfolio holdings.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, finance.Funding: The research of A.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers can sometimes be exploited because they make mistakes in their valuation of products. We present the results from a large-scale experimental study that examines whether third-party spectators from the general population in the United States cancel a voluntary deal where a buyer has made a mistake in the valuation of a product and agreed to pay more for the product than the seller knows it is worth. We find that the majority of the spectators cancel such deals, even when the seller’s involvement is limited to accepting a proposal made by the buyer. A substantial share of these spectators is also willing to fine the seller. However, a large minority of the spectators are willing to uphold the deal even when the seller has proposed the deal and obfuscated the information provided to the buyer. Our results shed new light on when people view market transactions as acceptable and their attitudes to government regulation of businesses.This paper was accepted by Axel Ockenfels, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This project was financed with support from the Norges Forskningsråd [Centres of Excellence Scheme Centre for Experimental Research on Fairness, Inequality and Rationality Project 262675 Grants 236995, 250415, 262636, and 302145].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When an agent receives information from a source whose accuracy might be either high or low, standard theory dictates that she update as if the source has medium accuracy. In a laboratory experiment, subjects deviate from this benchmark by reacting less to uncertain sources, especially when the sources release good news. This pattern is validated using observational data on stock price reactions to analyst earnings forecasts, where analysts with no forecast records are classified as uncertain sources. A theory of belief updating where agents are insensitive and averse to information accuracy uncertainty can explain these results.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: Y.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that private equity leveraged buyouts reduce perceived job quality despite not impacting average base pay. This appears to reflect employees bearing more risk. Both job quality and employee incentive pay are more related to firm performance at private equity-owned companies than at public control firms with 1% higher deal rate of return associated with 0.7% more employee incentive pay. Deals with high leverage and employees with worse outside options fuel the declines in job satisfaction after a buyout. Our results highlight how job quality is tied to job security and how ownership affects employees through mechanisms beyond base pay.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Funding: W.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms have inefficiently low incentives to innovate when other firms benefit from their inventions and the innovating firm therefore does not capture the full surplus of its innovations. We show that, in theory, common ownership of firms mitigates this impediment to corporate innovation. By contrast, without technological spillovers, innovation has the effect of stealing market share from rivals and in that case more common ownership reduces innovation. Empirically, the association between common ownership and innovation inputs and outputs decreases with product market proximity and increases with technology proximity. The sign and magnitude of the overall relationship between common ownership and corporate innovation thus varies considerably across the universe of firms depending on their relative proximity in technology and product market space. Some of these results persist if we use only variation from BlackRock’s acquisition of BGI. Our findings inform the debate about the welfare effects of increasing common ownership among U.S. corporations.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: The authors acknowledge grant funding from the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite strong theoretical predictions based on disagreement, limited empirical evidence links short-selling restrictions to higher prices. We test this relationship using quasi-experimental methods based on rule 201, a threshold-based policy that restricts aggressive short selling when intraday returns cross −10%. When comparing stocks on either side of the threshold in the same hour of trading, we find that the restriction leads to 8% lower short-sale volume and 35 basis points higher daily returns. These price effects do not reverse after the restriction is lifted.This paper was accepted by Bruno Biais, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.4987 .</content>

    <title>Double Marginalization Because of External Financing: Capacity Investment Under Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper considers a firm’s investment decision determining the timing and capacity level in a dynamic setting with demand uncertainty. Its investment is financed by borrowing from a lender that has market power, generating a capital market inefficiency. We show that the firm’s investment is subject to double marginalization in the sense that the need for external financing results in a considerably smaller investment and thus, a reduction in welfare. In addition, we find that the presence of the bankruptcy option mitigates the double-marginalization effect unless the bankruptcy cost is small. The firm’s investment size is increasing in bankruptcy costs, albeit at the expense of an investment delay. Based on this, an increase of bankruptcy costs raises social welfare.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Funding: X. Wen and H.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many products are most meaningfully described using unstructured data such as text or images. Unstructured data are also common in e-commerce, in which products are often described by photos and text but not with standardized sets of attributes. Whereas much is known about how to efficiently measure consumer preferences when products can be meaningfully described by structured attributes, there is scant research on doing the same for unstructured data. This paper introduces a real-time, adaptive survey design framework for measuring preferences over unstructured data, leveraging Bayesian optimization. By adaptively choosing items to display based on uncertainty around a nonparametric utility model, the proposed method maximizes information gain per question, enabling quick estimation of individual-level preferences. The approach operates on embeddings of the unstructured data, thereby eliminating the requirement for manual coding of product attributes. We apply the method to measuring preferences over clothing and highlight its potential for both the general task of marketing research and the specific task of designing customer onboarding surveys to mitigate the cold-start recommendation problem. We also develop methods for interpreting the nonparametric utility functions, which allow us to reconstruct consumer valuations of discrete attributes, even for attributes that were not considered or available a priori.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Fundings: Funding for this project was provided by Analytics at Wharton, the Wharton Behavioral Lab, and the Wharton Dean’s Fund.

    <title>Feature Misspecification in Sequential Learning Problems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a class of sequential learning problems where a decision maker must learn the unknown statistical characteristics of a finite set of alternatives (or systems) using sequential sampling to ultimately select a subset of “good” alternatives. A salient feature of our problem is that system performance is governed by a set of features. The decision maker postulates the dependence on these features to be linear, but this model may not precisely represent the true underlying system structure. We show that this misspecification, if not managed properly, can lead to suboptimal performance because of a phenomenon identified as sample-selection endogeneity. We propose a prospective sampling principle—a new approach that eliminates the adverse effects of misspecification as the number of samples grows large. The proposed principle applies across a very general class of widely used sampling policies, enjoys strong asymptotic performance guarantees, and exhibits effective finite-sample performance in numerical experiments.This paper was accepted by Vivek Farias, data science.Funding: This work was supported by the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation [Grant 2020063] and the Hong Kong Research Grant Council [GRF Grant 16501821 and ECS Grant 24210420].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00328 .</content>

    <title>Intersectionality: Affirmative Action with Multidimensional Identities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Studying the design of affirmative action policies when identities are multidimensional, we provide a formal demonstration of the importance of intersectionality. Prevailing affirmative action policies are based only on one identity dimension (e.g., race, gender, socioeconomic class). We find that any such nonintersectional policy can almost never achieve a representative outcome. In fact, nonintersectional policies often increase the underrepresentation of underrepresented groups in a manner undetected by standard measures. Examples based on race and gender reveal significant hidden inequality arising from nonintersectional policies. We show how to construct intersectional policies that achieve proportional representation.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund [FG 6-G, I 3487] and the Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-19-CE48-0018-01, ANR-19-P3IA-0003, and ANR-23-PEIA-0003].</content>

    <title>Do Physicians Improve More from Positive or Negative Feedback?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use clinical data on more than 240,000 surgeries and quasi-experimental methods to examine how physicians respond to the surprise release of a performance “report card.” Such feedback interventions are commonly used to encourage physicians to improve performance yet show limited evidence of success. Our results show that these limited effects mask heterogeneous behavioral responses to feedback valence. In particular, physicians improve more from positive feedback than from negative feedback, with negative feedback even reducing performance for a nontrivial share of patients. Experiments with laypersons replicate these results and show that struggles with negative feedback can be mitigated by giving incentives directly tied to improvement and by adding qualitative information that helps individuals interpret past performance. These results are consistent with behavioral models that suggest cognitive and emotional difficulties limit how well individuals use negative feedback. Thus, feedback interventions in healthcare should be carefully designed to mitigate these counterproductive behavioral responses.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: We acknowledge generous funding provided by Tilburg University and the University of Massachusetts Amherst to run the laboratory experiments.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01340 .</content>

    <title>Prismatic Trust: How Structural and Behavioral Signals in Networks Explain Trust Accumulation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The predominant focus of the organizational literature on trust has been on direct interactions between actors. Whereas this emphasis has solidified our understanding of the dyadic foundations of trust, we know relatively little about the mechanisms of trust creation in network contexts. In this paper, we introduce the network mechanism of prismatic trust to explain why some actors are more trusted than others. Specifically, we posit that networks act as prisms that generate signals of trustworthiness based on not only actors’ positions in the social structure, but also their networking behavior. Moreover, we also theorize that the combination of signals from network structure and behavior amplifies trust accumulation in network actors. We test our predictions using data from an online social trading platform with more than 28,000 traders across 38 weeks. We find that traders who occupy positions of higher status in the network and those who express positive sentiments in the content of their communications (networking behaviors), accumulate more trustors. Furthermore, the positive effects of network status and the expression of positive sentiments on trust accumulation are mutually reinforcing. In sum, we contribute to the organizational literature on trust by proposing the role of a prismatic view in explaining how trust accumulates in network actors as a function of their position in social structure, their networking behavior, and a combination of the two.This paper was accepted by Isabel Fernandez-Mateo, organizations.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02810 .</content>

    <title>Fast Delivery: B2B Field Experiments Amid COVID-19 Outbreak and New Normal</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Procuring essential products during disasters can save lives and livelihoods; nevertheless, limited research has explored this critical issue. In this paper, we collaborate with a buying company to run a unique B2B field experiment during the early COVID-19 outbreak that prompts an urgent need for personal protective equipment. We find that suppliers would deliver products faster by quoting a significantly shorter lead time when the buying company purchases products for donation rather than for resale. Similarly, suppliers quote a shorter lead time when the company provides crisis information—the number of COVID-19 cases in the region with high crisis levels—to highlight the urgent need for products. Interestingly, faster delivery does not come at the expense of the buying company. Buyers receive the products faster but also pay less. We collaborate with the same company to rerun the field experiment in the new normal and find that the buyer’s intent of donation leads to shorter lead time but not to lower wholesale price. Moreover, providing the COVID-19 information of the local community to suppliers has no impact on their decisions. Overall, our paper provides the first empirical evidence on suppliers’ lead time and wholesale price decisions during and after a disaster, thereby helping companies to deliver emergency products in a timely and efficient manner as well as designing their philanthropic and information strategies.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by a Behavioral Research Assistance Grant from the C.

    <title>Shuffling as a Sales Tactic: An Experimental Study of Selling Product Rankings</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the strategic interaction between a product expert and a consumer. The expert publicly commits to a ranking methodology to rank two products with uncertain relative merits; the consumer decides whether to acquire the ranking report to guide her product choice. The expert cares only about selling the report; the consumer derives utility from the product itself and an extra ranking attribute controlled by the expert. Strategic shuffling, in which the expert induces demand for his report by manipulating the uncertainty in product rankings, emerges as an equilibrium phenomenon. When the consumer highly values the top-ranked product, the expert-optimal equilibrium, which features shuffling, diverges from the consumer-optimal equilibrium. Laboratory evidence supports the predictions of the expert-optimal equilibrium. With limited field data because of the proprietary nature of ranking methodologies, our study provides useful alternative evidence on how ranking publishers may adopt methodologies that are not in consumers’ best interests.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by the Office of the Vice President and Associate Provost for Research and Graduate Studies at Lehigh University [Faculty Research Grant 606975] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Key Project 72033006].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02088 .</content>

    <title>LIBOR Discontinuation and the Cost of Bank Loans</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) being replaced by risk-free rate (RFR)-based alternative reference rates, the fundamental differences between the two benchmarking frameworks impose significant risks on banks. Exploiting the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)’s announcement of the phase-out of LIBOR, we conduct a difference-in-differences analysis based on banks’ reliance on LIBOR and show that LIBOR discontinuation entails higher interest rate spread of bank loans. The result implies that banks tend to compensate for the LIBOR-to-RFR risks by passing on the transition costs to borrowers. This effect is attenuated if multiple benchmarks are already in use, for relationship lending, and among banks operating in a competitive environment. We further find that LIBOR discontinuation leads to more collateral and covenant requirements in loan terms. After the FCA announcement, banks are inclined to switch away from LIBOR dependence by referencing alternative rates.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Funding: J.-B.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economists often measure discrimination as disparities arising from the direct effects of group identity. We develop new tools to model and measure systemic discrimination, capturing how discrimination in other decisions indirectly contributes to disparities. A novel experimental design, the Iterated Audit, identifies systemic discrimination. We then illustrate these new tools in two field experiments. The first experiment shows how racial discrimination can accumulate across multiple rounds of hiring through the interaction of two forces: greater discrimination against inexperienced workers, which affects the opportunity to obtain experience, and high subsequent returns to experience. The second experiment shows how gender-based differences in the language of recommendation letters can translate into systemic gender discrimination in STEM hiring. We discuss how our findings qualify previous results on direct discrimination and how our tools can be used to target policy interventions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a new foundation of risk aversion by showing that this attitude is fully captured by the propensity to seize insurance opportunities. In our main results, we first characterize Arrow-Pratt (1963–1964) risk aversion in terms of propensity to full insurance and the stronger notion of risk aversion of Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970) in terms of propensity to partial insurance. We then extend the analysis to comparative risk aversion by showing that the classical notion of Yaari (1969) corresponds to comparative propensity to full insurance, while the stronger notion of Ross (1981) corresponds to comparative propensity to partial insurance.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide the first evidence on how workers invest in human capital after losing ability. Using quasi-random work accidents in Danish administrative data, we find that workers enroll in bachelor’s programs after physical injuries, pursuing degrees that build on their past training and experience. Exploiting institutional differences in the stackability of degrees, we find that higher education moves injured workers from disability benefits to full-time employment, earning 25 percent more than before injury. Reskilling subsidies for injured workers pay for themselves four times over, and current rates of reskilling are substantially below the social optimum, especially for middle-aged workers.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entry represents a fundamental threat to cartels. We study the extent and effect of this behavior in the largest price-fixing case in US history, which involves generic drug manufacturing. We link information on the cartel’s internal operations to regulatory filings and market data. There is a substantial increase in entry after cartel formation, but regulatory approvals delay most entrants by two to four years. We estimate a structural model and simulate counterfactual equilibria. Absent entry, cartel profits would be dramatically higher. Correspondingly, reducing regulatory delays by just 1–2 years equates to consumer compensating variation of $612  million–$1.5  billion. (JEL L12, L13, L25, L51, L65, M31, O34)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The child mental health crisis has been described as the “defining public health crisis of our time.” This article addresses three myths about the crisis: (i) the idea that the crisis is new; (ii) the belief that increases in youth suicide mainly reflect deterioration in children’s underlying mental health; and (iii) the myth that investments in children have little impact on children’s mental health. In fact, the crisis has existed for decades, youth suicides vary asynchronously with other mental health measures and are impacted by external factors such as firearms legislation, and investments can improve child mental health and prevent suicide.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is substantial spatial heterogeneity in household carbon emissions. I leverage movers in two decades of administrative Decennial Census and American Community Survey data to estimate place effects—the amount by which carbon emissions change for the same household living in different places—for almost 1,000 cities and roughly 61,500 neighborhoods across the United States. I estimate that place effects account for 14–23 percent of overall heterogeneity. A change in neighborhood-level place effects from 1 standard deviation above the mean to 1 below would reduce household carbon emissions from residential energy and commuting by about 40 percent.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study one benefit to firms of selling subscriptions: the prospect that consumers will continue to pay for subscriptions they no longer value. We use comprehensive data from a large payment card network to document that months during which cards are replaced, when active renewal is required, are associated with much higher rates of cancellation. Using two stylized models of consumer inertia—driven by inattention or switching costs—we estimate that these cancellation frictions roughly double seller revenues on average, holding fixed initial subscribers. We use the estimated models to explore the impact of possible regulatory remedies. (JEL D12, D18, L81, L88)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With a growing mental health crisis and a shortage of behavioral health specialists, those seeking mental health treatment often face long wait times to obtain care. I study how clinic congestion affects mortality for veterans experiencing mental health emergencies. I find that longer waiting times make it more likely that patients miss their follow-up mental health visit, consequently increasing the probability that they permanently disengage from care. A 1 standard deviation increase in wait time between the emergency department visit and follow-up appointment date (11.7 days) increases two-year mortality by about 1.5 percent.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use public finance sufficient statistic approaches to characterize the welfare effects of “nudges,” such as simplified information and warning labels, in markets with taxes and endogenous prices. While many studies focus on average effects, we show that welfare also depends on how the nudge affects the variance of choice distortions, and average effects become irrelevant with zero pass-through or optimal taxes. We implement the framework with experiments evaluating automotive fuel economy labels and sugary drink health labels. Labels decrease purchases of low-fuel economy cars and sugary drinks but may decrease welfare because they increase the variance of choice distortions.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how couples allocate retirement-saving contributions across each spouse’s account. In a new dataset covering over a million US individuals, we find retirement contributions are not allocated to the account with the highest employer match rate. This lack of coordination—which goes against the assumptions of most models of household decision-making—is common, costly, persistent over time, and cannot be explained by inertia, auto-enrollment, or simple heuristics. Complementing the administrative evidence with an online survey, we find that inefficient allocations reflect both financial mistakes as well as deliberate choices, especially when trust and commitment inside the households are weak.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is limited evidence on how university spin‐offs (USOs) respond to external crises. We fill this gap by assessing how UK digital USOs responded to the recent COVID‐19 pandemic. Specifically, we examine how USOs' capabilities (scaling‐up, fundraising, and intellectual property) and access to their parent university's financial resources/infrastructures interact intertemporally to address demand and supply challenges associated with the pandemic. Our analysis revealed that the interplay of (a) USOs' scaling‐up and fundraising capabilities and (b) USOs' fundraising capabilities and university parent's support infrastructure constituted the best strategy for developing intertemporal resilience during the crisis.Managerial SummaryWe investigate the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on digital USOs. Assuming support from parent universities, we explored how their scaling‐up efforts, fundraising efforts, and intellectual property addressed demand and supply challenges during these unprecedented times. First, USOs that could scale up while fundraising were more likely to sustain operations and satisfy demand through various stages of the pandemic. Second, USOs with fundraising capabilities and parent university support demonstrated greater resilience. These findings suggest valuable insights for CEOs of USOs and their parent universities in handling external crises.</content>

    <title>Do digital platforms create entrepreneurial opportunities? Evidence from marginal areas</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article enters the debate on the effects of digital platforms on entrepreneurial opportunities by estimating whether the entry of a home‐sharing platform shapes entrepreneurial decisions in marginal areas. We add a novel perspective to the literature, as we contend that when economic conditions are unfavorable, digital platforms, acting as External Enablers, stimulate entrepreneurship. We test these arguments on the unique setting of 270 Italian Borghi and the entry of Airbnb, employing a staggered difference‐in‐difference design. We show that, following the entry of Airbnb, the entrepreneurial activity of the surrounding area increases, with effects that are heterogeneous across sectors and stronger in more depressed areas. We also show qualitative–quantitative evidence of the mechanisms explaining these effects. Finally, we discuss theoretical contributions to digital‐entrepreneurship literature and implications.Managerial SummaryThis study provides implications for both prospective entrepreneurs and policymakers willing to incentivize the creation of new businesses in marginal and remote areas. First, we show that, in marginal locations, digital platforms act as facilitators for entrepreneurs facing a complex and risky decision to embark on new business activities, particularly, if these are along the scope of the platform. This happens because platforms create demand—if not existing—and reduce entry and operating costs by internalizing specific business processes. Second, we offer a clear recommendation to policymakers. We show that digital platforms represent an indirect and effective way of pursuing the development of entrepreneurship in marginal areas. This aspect is relevant as scholars have demonstrated that direct approaches are not always effective.</content>

    <title>Effort Redirection Across Multiple Career Tracks: Salary-Cut Policy and State-Owned Enterprises in China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior literature in agency theory assumes that when incentives decrease, agents may shirk and reduce effort. We extend this work to multiple career tracks and suggest that a salary decrease may not necessarily lead to effort reduction, but instead may redirect efforts across multiple career tracks. Using an exogenous salary-cut policy shock levied on top executives of Chinese central state-owned enterprises (SOEs), our difference-in-differences analysis reveals that salary cuts motivate SOE top executives to redirect efforts from improving internal management (i.e., operational efficiency) to political objectives (i.e., job creation). A further test reveals that job creation mediates the relationship between salary cuts and SOE top executives’ political appointments. Moreover, top executive age, as an indicator of political incentive, and media coverage, which reflects external monitoring, weaken the impact of the salary-cut policy on effort redirection between the two career tracks. These findings provide implications for research on agency theory, SOEs, and public policy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies whether investor composition affects the sovereign debt market. We construct a data set of sovereign debt holdings by foreign and domestic bank, nonbank private and official investors for 101 countries across three decades. Compared with other investors, private nonbank investors absorb a disproportionate share of the debt supply, and their demand for emerging market debt is most price responsive. A counterfactual analysis of emerging market sovereigns shows a 10% increase in debt leads to a 5.8% yield increase but an outsized 8.4% increase without nonbank investors. We conclude that sovereigns are vulnerable to the loss of nonbanks. F34, G11, G15, F41</content>

    <title>Courting the Sharks: The Influence of CEO Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry on New Venture Funding</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We draw from the social psychology literature to introduce an alternative conceptualization of executive narcissism—narcissistic admiration and rivalry. In the context of chief executive officers (CEOs) pitching to investors, we theorize how narcissistic CEOs may use distinct behavioral strategies to pursue status, thereby shaping investor sentiment and ultimately affecting investors’ funding decisions. Using Shark Tank data, we find evidence that narcissistic admiration and rivalry are associated with opposing patterns in new venture funding, as shaped by investor sentiment. Specifically, CEO narcissistic admiration is positively associated with new venture funding by increasing investor sentiment, whereas CEO narcissistic rivalry is negatively associated with new venture funding by decreasing investor sentiment. These results highlight the need to separate narcissistic admiration and rivalry in executive narcissism research and illustrate the underlying mechanisms through which executive narcissism shapes organizational outcomes. Overall, this study provides new insights into two pathways of executive narcissism and offers evidence consistent with the idea that executive narcissism matters in entrepreneurial contexts.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.17024 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stock and bond prices of a country move together with increasing country-specific risk. Bonds effectively hedge growth expectation risk when country-specific risk is low, resulting in a negative stock-bond correlation. However, as country-specific risk increases, hedging is less effective because (1) rising domestic prices tend to reduce a country’s growth potential and (2) global growth expectation shocks are more persistent than country-specific ones. Consequently, countries with greater country-specific risk exhibit a relatively positive stock-bond correlation. Equity investments in these countries outperform those with negative relationships by 7%–11% annually. The superior performance is not driven by investing in a fixed set of countries.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmidt, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Yonsei University [Grant 2024-22-0467].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07047 .</content>

    <title>Business Acquisition Disclosures: The Effect of Identifying Intangible Assets on Investors’ Judgments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Disclosures about a business acquisition help investors understand what assets are acquired and how the acquiring company plans to benefit from the transaction. However, in practice, these disclosures exhibit significant variation and often fall short of providing meaningful information to investors. Our experiment provides evidence that separately identifying intangible assets acquired in a business combination (i.e., what was acquired) can compensate for shortcomings in an acquirer’s disclosures about how the transaction will benefit the acquiring firm. An additional experiment indicates that the benefits of separately identifying acquired assets do not extend to tangible assets, suggesting our insights may be unique to intangibles.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: Z.

    <title>Switching the Telescope Lens: A Sociomaterial Perspective of Sustainable Agricultural (Proto)Practices Transfer in an Agrifood Supply Chain</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the implementation and transfer of sustainable agricultural practices (SUSAPs) across a multitier agrifood supply chain (SC) using Brazilian poultry farming as the empirical context. We conduct an interpretive case study of buyer–supplier–subsupplier triads, including those certified under Global Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and noncertified counterparts, using interviews, observations, and secondary data. Adopting a sociomaterial perspective, we investigate how SUSAPs' components—meanings, materials, and competencies—are embedded within specific SC tiers and transferred across the triad. A zoom‐in analysis reveals that only animal welfare is a fully adopted practice, whereas waste management, working conditions, and biosecurity remain in development as protopractices. A zoom‐out analysis of SUSAPs' components shows limited buyer influence across the triad, while first‐tier suppliers facilitate SUSAP transfer. We advance theory by demonstrating how a sociomaterial perspective explains the degree of SUSAPs' implementation and transfer, and introducing theboomerang effect, illustrating how first‐tier suppliers enable SUSAP implementation among certified and noncertified subsuppliers to ensure safer and more sustainable products. These insights help managers transfer SUSAPs into their SCs by leveraging first‐tier suppliers as boundary spanners.</content>

    <title>The Costs of Ambiguous Information Disclosure: On the Unintended Consequences of Providing Restaurant Hygiene Scores on Platforms in the United States</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Information disclosure on digital platforms is ubiquitous, yet it frequently results in unintended consequences, given the prevalence of simplified cues prone to ambiguity in digital platforms’ information design. We study how the addition of hygiene inspection scores, in the form of simplified information disclosure, to restaurant webpages on Yelp across the United States affects restaurant demand. We find that showing high (clean) hygiene scores on Yelp paradoxically reduces restaurant demand relative to restaurants for which Yelp does not show hygiene scores on their Yelp pages. We argue that consumers conflate online hygiene scores with the healthiness and tastiness of the food, thus intuitively leading to reduced demand. Our results reveal that ambiguity is the primary cause of misperceptions about hygiene scores. We also show that providing simple clarifications about the correct meaning of hygiene scores, as well as tweaking the displayed hygiene information to resolve ambiguity, helps mitigate consumer misperceptions. Our research informs practice on how valuable information can be presented online effectively in such a way as to reduce ambiguity, especially on social media platforms. We provide managerial implications for platforms such as Yelp and city municipal authorities that would like to disclose key information online.</content>

    <title>International institutions and firms' assessment of the domestic institutional environment: Evidence from the investor‐state dispute settlement system</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do firms assess their institutional environments? Beyond domestic cues, we examine the role of international institutions. In the global investment treaty regime, foreign firms can bring legal claims against sovereign states in international venues for alleged property rights violations. We argue that rulings by international tribunals in favor of or against the state provide domestic observer firms additional cues about property rights protection and the legitimacy of state policy. We compare domestic firms' assessment of their institutional environment shortly before versus after a tribunal ruling to obtain quasi‐random variation in firms' exposure to international institutions. Analyzing 14,338 firm responses across 16 countries, we find that domestic firms assess their institutional environment favorably when states win and unfavorably when states lose.Managerial SummaryTo ensure that their strategic choices fit the institutional environment in which they operate, firms must assess and update their perceptions of the institutional environment. We examine how firms' perceptions of their institutional environment are shaped by rulings of international tribunals in investor‐state disputes. When an international tribunal adjudicates an investment dispute between a foreign firm and a sovereign state, domestic firms use the ruling as cues about property rights protection and the legitimacy of state policy. Using data on firm‐level assessments of their institutional environments across 16 countries and rulings by international tribunals, we demonstrate that domestic firms perceive their domestic institutional environment more favorably when states win and less favorably when states lose.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many countries base college admissions on a centrally-administered test. Students invest a great deal of resources to improve their performance on the test, and there is growing concern about the high costs associated with these activities. We consider modifying the test by introducing performance-disclosure policies that pool intervals of performance rankings. Pooling affects the equilibrium allocation of students to colleges, which hurts some students and benefits others, but also affects students’ effort. We investigate how such policies can improve students’ welfare in a Pareto sense, study the Pareto frontier of pooling policies, and identify improvements that are robust to the distribution of college seats.We illustrate the potential applicability of our results with an empirical estimation that uses data on college admissions in Turkey. We find that a policy that pools a large fraction of the lowest performing students leads to a Pareto improvement in a contest based on the estimated parameters. A laboratory experiment based on the estimated parameters generally supports our theoretical predictions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this study, we investigate the impact of organizational structures on supply chain participants, specifically when retailers establish strategic inventory in a competitive environment. We build a two-period supply chain model in which two retailers procure from a common supplier, compete in multiple markets, and can carry inventory from the first period to the second. We characterize the optimal strategies for firms under three scenarios, depending on whether each retailer operates under centralization or decentralization. Contrary to previous research, we find that it is not beneficial for a retailer to hold strategic inventory when the retailer is decentralized and the rival is centralized, regardless of how small the holding cost is. This result demonstrates the existence of free-riding behavior, where a decentralized retailer does not carry any inventory but benefits from the rival’s strategic inventory, provided the rival is centralized. Furthermore, centralization increases a retailer’s strategic inventory level but lowers its rival’s level, irrespective of the rival’s organizational structure. Centralization by any retailer enhances the overall strategic inventory level in the supply chain.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online reviews play an important role in explaining product demand. Our study extends the literature by assessing how arousal (the intensity of the emotion), an important dimension of emotion, and valence (the positiveness of the emotion) can affect product demand across different customer groups. Specifically, regarding product demand from new customers, consumers infer service quality from expressed valence and arousal from other consumers’ reviews. Regarding product demand from returning customers, consumers develop perceptions of service quality based on experienced valence and arousal (reflected in their reviews). We then examine product demand from new customers (Study 1 and Study 2a) as well as that from returning customers (Study 1 and Study 2b), and establish the external and internal validity regarding the moderating effects of arousal on different types of product demand. The results reveal that, although arousal has positive moderating effects for both new and returning customers, the strengths of the moderating effects differ. Furthermore, valence and arousal from other customers do not have significant effects for returning customers. Our study contributes to the literature by clarifying the moderating effect of arousal on product demand and by providing a more nuanced understanding of product demand at the customer profile level. Our results thus offer important practical suggestions regarding how to explain product demand across different customer groups by considering the textual information (i.e., arousal) of customer reviews.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Reducing Food Waste in U.S. Food Banks: The Role of Distribution Strategies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Up to 40 percent of the food supply in the U.S. goes uneaten while one in nine individuals struggle to put enough food on their table. Food banks serve an important role in addressing food insecurity by matching the supply of excess food with the demand from the food-insecure population. They collect in-kind donations (“non-discretionary” food), often perishable and highly variable in their quality, quantity, content, and timing, and then distribute these donations to serve the needs of the food-insecure population. Reducing waste in the food distribution process is critical to improving the effectiveness of food banks. Our study provides a holistic investigation of food waste at food banks, utilizing data from 200 food banks within the Feeding America network over a five-year horizon. We utilize a two-stage least squares approach for our analysis, accounting for the potential endogeneity bias in this setting. We find that while food waste increases with the proportion of non-discretionary food supply, with a larger impact at higher levels of non-discretionary food, a larger fleet size and gaining faster access to clients through an on-site emergency pantry can mitigate this rate of increase. Furthermore, the use of direct distribution strategies to reach clients faster, such as just-in-time delivery using mobile pantries, can significantly reduce food waste. On the other hand, the impact of agency-empowered delivery, where food banks coordinate the distribution of the donated food directly from donors to the partner agencies, depends on the size of the network. We validate our findings using structured interviews with 19 food bank employees from five different food banks in various positions. Overall, our results provide a better understanding of the impact of direct distribution strategies, an increased trucking capacity, or an increased pantry size on the level of food waste in the distribution process, which can help food banks make more informed decisions on where to invest their limited resources to reduce food waste.</content>

The value function depends on the belief, so the functional Bellman equation is infinite-dimensional. Significantly, in contrast with the traditional approach, we derive a functional equation for the derivative of the value function with respect to the inventory level, which provides a direct approach to computing the optimal base-stock policy. In two well-known cases, we characterize how the base-stock level depends on the belief, and we implement the approach to compute the optimal base-stock level. In the first case of conjugate probabilities, the infinite-dimensional state reduces to a finite-dimensional sufficient statistic. That allows us to solve two numerical examples of exponential and Weibull demands. Moreover, for the exponential demand example, we compare the optimal cost with the costs achieved by two myopic policies with three guesses of the initial belief. We find that the optimal policy improves upon the first myopic policy by 12.6%, 13%, and 9.2%, and upon the second myopic policy by 29.2%, 26.9%, and 27.7%. The second case considers the demand to come from one of two possible distributions, but we do not know which. Here, we derive a functional equation in one hyperparameter expressing the ratio of the weights assigned to the two distributions. We then develop an approximation scheme to solve it, show that it converges, and implement it numerically to obtain the optimal base-stock levels over time.</content>

    <title>On the Sparsity of Optimal Linear Decision Rules for a Class of Robust Optimization Problems with Box Uncertainty Sets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One of the major reasons for the popularity of robust optimization is that these problems are often amenable to efficient approximations in operational planning problems where decisions must be made over time under uncertainty. The most common approximation is based on restricting the control policies to “linear decision rules”, that is, linear functions of the information revealed up in the past. In the paper “On the Sparsity of Optimal Linear Decision Rules for a Class of Robust Optimization Problems with Box Uncertainty Sets,” Lu and Sturt prove for a class of robust inventory management problems that there always exists an optimal linear decision rule in which the number of nonzero parameters in the linear decision rule grows linearly in the number of time periods. This is the first result to prove that optimal linear decision rules are sparse in a widely studied class of robust optimization problems with many time periods. Harnessing this sparsity guarantee, the authors develop a novel reformulation technique and active set algorithm for computing optimal linear decision rules that yield a 32× speedup over state-of-the-art linear programming solvers in numerical experiments on production–inventory problems with hundreds of time periods.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traders operating in informal economies tend to use nonaccounting metrics in their credit allocation decisions. By using a combination of survey questions and a hypothetical choice experiment, we explore wholesalers’ preferences for retailers’ accounting information and, importantly, the reasons for its limited use. Based on estimates of wholesalers’ willingness to pay for retailer information, we find that, although wholesalers continue to value nonaccounting information such as retailers’ community membership and relationship length, wholesalers also overwhelmingly value sales and profits in making credit decisions. However, wholesalers do not use accounting information because it is perceived to be unreliable, and retailers do not share this information because it might be misused. Our findings suggest that improving the reliability of accounting information and preventing its misuse will increase the use of such information in credit allocation in informal markets.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: R.

    <title>Essentiality Checks for Standard Essential Patents</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is widespread concern about the lack of transparency regarding standard essential patents (SEPs). This paper examines the proposal to introduce essentiality checks, a certification scheme for declared SEPs. We develop a framework that allows us to evaluate how essentiality checks would impact licensing, litigation, and incentives to innovate. In our model, an upstream innovator invests in R&amp;D and privately learns about the likely essentiality of its patents for a standard. The innovator then licenses the patents to a downstream implementer who can contest the essentiality of the patents in court. We show that, although essentiality checks can reduce litigation, they also raise incentives for R&amp;D investment. Because the latter can be excessive if FRAND requirements are ineffective and spillovers are small, the overall welfare impact of essentiality checks is ambiguous.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: C.

    <title>The Beauty Bias and Leader Emergence: A Theoretical Integration, Extension, and Meta-Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leader emergence is a critical organizational phenomenon, influenced by various individual attributes. One such attribute—often overlooked by scholars and practitioners—is physical attractiveness. This study provides a comprehensive meta-analysis of the beauty bias and its relationship to leader emergence. We first review implicit leadership and status generalization theories as the dominant frameworks explaining this bias. Next, we assess the magnitude of the physical attractiveness–leader emergence relationship and test the “beauty is beastly” effect by evaluating leader gender as a moderator. We also identify two key mechanisms—perceived warmth and perceived competence—that explain this relationship. Additionally, we explore the robustness of the beauty bias across different contexts, including observer characteristics, leadership roles, and national culture. Our findings confirm that physical attractiveness is significantly related to leader emergence, primarily through perceptions of warmth, but also through perceptions of competence. This relationship holds equally for male and female leaders and is stronger in informal leadership contexts. It is slightly more pronounced among college students than full-time employees and in collectivist rather than individualistic national cultures, yet remains equally strong across executive and non-executive leadership roles. Overall, our findings highlight the strength and consistency of the physical attractiveness–leader emergence relationship, underscoring the need for organizations to mitigate the beauty bias from influencing decisions around leader emergence.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We find that common ownership among acquirers enhances rather than hinders competition in the firm sale process. One common owner raises the likelihood that target firms are sold through auction (vs. negotiation with one buyer) by 21.5%. The effect is causal according to identifications based on mergers between financial institutions. Exploring economic channels, we observe selling firms respond to common ownership among acquirers by avoiding cross-owned acquirers, bargaining hard, and inviting more buyers when cross-owned acquirers initiate the deal but not by terminating the deal. Consistent with enhanced competition, common ownership among acquirers is positively associated with deal quality.</content>

    <title>Does Speculative News Hurt Productivity? Evidence from Takeover Rumors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that productivity at both the firm and employee (i.e., analyst and inventor) level temporarily declines upon announcements of takeover rumors that do not materialize. Such speculative news may hurt productivity because uncertainty and the threat of job loss cause anxiety, distraction, and reduced commitment among employees and managers. Consistently, we observe a more pronounced productivity dip for rumored targets and when the likelihood of job loss is higher. Firm performance mirrors these results. We find no indication of reverse causality. The evidence fosters our understanding of potential real effects of speculative financial news and the costs of takeover threats.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We model two methods of executing segregated retail orders: brokers' routing, whereby brokers allocate orders using the market maker's overall performance, and order‐by‐order auctions, where market makers bid on individual orders, a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposal. Order‐by‐order auctions improve allocative efficiency, but face a winner's curse reducing retail investor welfare, particularly when liquidity is limited. Additional market participants competing for retail orders fail to improve total efficiency and investor welfare when entrants possess information superior to incumbent wholesalers. Our results hold when new entrants are less informed or the information structure differs. We also examine the cross‐subsidization of brokers' routing.</content>

    <title>The Diversity Paradox: The Unintended Consequences of Gender Diversity on Gender Pay Equity</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how gender diversity and employees' internal pay position interact to explain gender differences in pay raises. Integrating equity theory and institutional theory, we argue that pay raises are guided by equity‐based reward allocation policies. Further, we expect a decoupling between these policies and their implementation if other gender diversity goals, such as a balanced ratio of female and male employees at the work‐unit level, are achieved. Specifically, gender diversity at the work‐unit level provides legitimacy that corporate diversity goals are being pursued. This makes the implementation of reward allocation policies aimed at increasing gender pay equity less salient in work units with high levels of gender diversity. We test our hypotheses using a multilevel moderated mediation model on a longitudinal sample of 9,246 observations from 4,003 employees in a large German company. Our results show an indirect effect of gender on pay increases over 3 years via compa ratio (i.e., the relative pay position for a given job grade). In support of equity theory, the results show that women receive higher pay increases than men over time to compensate for a lower compa ratio. Moreover, in work units with high gender diversity, the indirect effect of gender on pay raise is weaker, suggesting a decoupling between equity‐based reward allocation policies and their implementation. Our results offer valuable insights into the interaction of equity and institutional theory‐based explanations of reaching corporate diversity goals.</content>

    <title>Unpacking the inertia in resource allocation adjustments of multi‐business firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Resource allocation inertia—firms' insufficient responsiveness in adjusting resource allocation across business units—hinders adaptation and competitive advantage. Yet, it is unclear why some firms are more prone to this inertia. We develop and test theory suggesting that resource allocation inertia increases with unrelated diversification, which arises when firms operate in multiple, unrelated industries, because of greater information complexity and HQ detachment. This disadvantage, however, diminishes in dynamic environments. Likewise, both recent experience in entering new markets and organizational slack can help firms counteract resource allocation inertia. Our findings contribute to the resource allocation literature by clarifying how unrelated diversification drives resource allocation inertia and how managers can mitigate it.Managerial SummaryResearch finds that many firms do not adjust resource allocation sufficiently over time, which undermines their competitiveness. Our paper shows that resource allocation inertia increases with unrelated diversification, which occurs when firms operate in multiple, unrelated industries. This inertia arises because the high complexity and cognitive demands of portfolios of unrelated businesses make it difficult for headquarters to comprehensively understand each unit's unique needs and opportunities for adjustments. However, we show that corporate managers of firms with high unrelated diversification can mitigate resource allocation inertia by accumulating experience in entering new markets and maintaining organizational slack, both of which enhance their ability to process complex information.</content>

    <title>How high‐performance outliers affect relative entrepreneurial entry on competing crowdfunding platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs have increasingly entered digital crowdfunding platforms as a viable option for acquiring capital. This paper examines how high‐performance outliers—projects that raised substantial amounts of capital—affect other entrepreneurs' decisions to enter crowdfunding. The present study focuses on the two largest rewards‐based crowdfunding platforms, Kickstarter and Indiegogo. Results indicate that, following outliers, entry was relatively higher on the platform with less restrictive, entrant‐friendly governance (i.e., Indiegogo). This effect was more pronounced among low‐quality entrants and moderated by projects in categories that have higher capital requirements. The findings suggest that differences in platform governance influence how subsequent entrepreneurial entrants behave.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs use crowdfunding as a viable source of capital. This paper looks at how outliers—projects that raise substantial capital—affected subsequent entry decisions by other entrepreneurs onto the two largest platforms, Kickstarter and Indiegogo. Outliers led to relatively more projects joining Indiegogo, but those projects were disproportionately of low quality. Projects in categories that typically seek more money disproportionately joined Kickstarter. When considered in the context of platform competition, not only does platform governance affect levels of entry on a platform, it also alters the relative mix of entrants that join each platform.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How can the selection of innovation projects be designed to reduce false positives and false negatives? Prior research has provided theoretical insights into organizing to reduce errors, yet we know little about how organizations adapt selection over time and the effects of this on selection outcomes. Drawing from qualitative data from 126 interviews conducted over several years, we explore how an accelerator evolved through three selection regimes for high-stakes funding decisions, focusing on the organizational changes and their underlying reasons. We then analyze quantitative data from all 3,580 submissions they received, assessing false positives and false negatives across these regimes. Our findings reveal a persistent occurrence of both types of errors, with relatively small differences across the regimes despite deliberate efforts to enhance the process. In the final regime, which increased submission quality by emphasizing applicant track record and adding additional layers of screening, evaluators surprisingly became more prone to making selection errors. This finding stands net of accounting for (1) differences in the pool of submissions, (2) differences in treatment effects through training and resources provided, (3) learning, and (4) market evolution. By combining qualitative and quantitative data, we explain this through two mechanisms: (1) mean reversion in combination with increased emphasis on applicant track record and (2) within-type adverse selection enabled by a more stringent selection process. The study reveals that evolving an organization’s selection regime may require adjustments across multiple aspects, resulting in unintended consequences.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17482 .</content>

    <title>Employee “Free” Speech vs. Organizational Censorship on Social Media: Balancing the Tension Between Free Expression and Safeguards to Foster Psychological Safety</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Free speech is a core principle in most democratic societies. However, the proliferation of prejudiced speech on social media has prompted intense debates about censorship. As a corollary in the workplace, and against the backdrop of online boundary blurring, we recruited a U.S. nationally representative sample to document that coworkers’ prejudiced social media posts concern Democrats whereas employer censorship of such posts concerns Republicans. To investigate this tension, we integrated boundary research into the psychological safety literature to theorize that organizational censorship on social media differentially affects liberals’ and conservatives’ individual-level psychological safety at work. We also theorized that psychological safety may be fostered—for all employees—by exploiting the tension between safeguards and free expression in organizational social media policies. Taking a multimethod approach, we first explored reactions to organizational censorship of prejudiced speech using open-ended responses (Study 1). Next, we demonstrated in preregistered observational and experimental surveys that such censorship increases Democrats’ psychological safety but decreases Republicans’ psychological safety (Studies 2–3). Finally, in a preregistered, conjoint survey experiment (Study 4), we examined moderators that could help manage this tension. We found that alignment between organizational values and censorship practices, as well as censorship of anti-Black speech, threatening speech, and references to one’s organization, can improve psychological safety for Democrats without undermining psychological safety for Republicans. As political polarization permeates societies worldwide, maintaining the social-relational fabric of organizations will require policies that balance ideological demands. We conclude by discussing implications for psychological safety, “free” speech, and organizational censorship.Funding: This project was funded by the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business and Rooney Center for the Study of American Democracy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.19506 .</content>

The research focuses on improving policy optimization by reusing historical trajectories through importance sampling in natural policy gradient methods. The authors rigorously analyze the convergence properties of this approach and demonstrate that reusing past data enhances convergence rates while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Their findings have practical implications for applications where data collection is costly or limited, such as robotics and autonomous systems. By integrating these insights into policy optimization frameworks, the study provides a valuable contribution to the field of reinforcement learning.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We test how effective a human–algorithm interaction is at stopping users from overdrawing their bank accounts. We use a randomized field experiment and draw our sample from users of a large personal financial management platform operating in the United States and Canada. We find that sending as-needed reminders is effective in and of itself, and the impact is intensified by the human response to the structure of the message. More simple messages are more effective, and the framing of the simplified message makes a difference. Users with medium to high annual incomes and users with fair to good credit scores are most likely to respond positively. We find that the investigated artificial intelligence solution reduces information-gathering costs and has a positive effect but is not sufficient in all cases. Those with challenging financial situations may find it harder to act upon the warning. For our analysis, we employ parametric identifications and time-to-event semiparametric analysis. Our work contributes to the literature on financial technology as advisors, human–computer interaction, limited attention, behavioral finance, and experimental finance.This paper has been accepted by Jean-Edouard Colliard for the Special Issue on The Human–Algorithm Connection.Funding: O.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do dealers use their financing discretion to charge higher interest rate markups to high-risk customers? We use unique transaction-level data to examine finance and vehicle profits in the subprime auto market with three main results. First, financing subprime customers is costly for dealerships because of loan discounts that are only partially offset by proceeds from interest rate markups. Second, financing is costliest to dealers for deep subprime customers with low credit scores and low incomes. Third, instead of offsetting financing costs, vehicle markups are lowest for deep subprime customers. Finance margins and vehicle markups are also positively correlated more generally.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.04086 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the effects of incentive plans on the quantity and quality of creative production. We examine a serial publishing platform that switched from a uniform commission (UC) plan to a quantity-based commission (QBC) plan offering a bonus commission rate when writers’ production meets a preset threshold. Our analysis reveals that, for a given book, chapters published in the months when writers reached the preset threshold quantity, and thus earned bonus commission rates, exhibited higher quality, as measured by the chapter-to-chapter customer retention rate. Such a positive correlation was nonsignificant for books published under the UC plan. We interpret that the implementation of a QBC plan enhanced the complementarity between quantity and quality in the writers’ payoff function. Further empirical analysis shows that this effect persisted over time. Moreover, the degree of enhanced complementarity was lower for writers who earned commissions from multiple books. Our key result remains robust when measuring quality by reader comments sentiment. Overall, the findings underscore the critical role of well-designed incentives in enhancing the platform’s effectiveness in managing mass creativity.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the London School of Economics and Political Science [Internal Research Fund, Department of Management], the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology [Yuk-Shee Chan Professorship Fund], the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto [China Research Initiative Grant], and McGill University [Desautels Faculty of Management Research Support F].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Management scholarship's apparent lack of impact is a misconception based on the presumption that impact involves a direct and visible influence of papers or research projects on management practice. Theory‐building impacts management practice in diverse, sometimes indirect and unnoticed, manifold ways. Supported by intermediaries such as management education, the media, and consulting, impacts emerge through interest‐driven knowledge production that contributes to the wider uptake and reproduction of management theory's main ideas and assumptions. We draw on Jürgen Habermas's theory of knowledge and human interests, aiming to expand how impact from scholarship can be understood, and what forms it might take as part of the kinds of knowledge‐constitutive interests that are pursued through theory‐building. We elaborate these different forms, building a pluralist framework of what we call ‘programmatic’ and ‘hybrid’ types of impact. We advance the argument that diverse knowledge‐constitutive interests pursued through theory‐building contribute to our field's impact on management practice in distinct, yet complementary ways.</content>

    <title>Improving Human Sustainability at Work by Focusing on Cognitive Load of Task Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mounting information processing demands in contemporary organizations spotlight the need to better understand how to maintain and improve performance without increasing cognitive load. Research in organizational behavior suggests that primed goals provide performance benefits similar to assigned goals but with little cost to attention. Yet, some research in social psychology suggests that any form of goal use, including primed goals, usurps attention. To reconcile these viewpoints, we examined the relationships among assigned and primed goals, performance, and demands on attention (measured as cognitive load) in three experiments. Experiment 1 (n = 233) showed that when a primed goal is aligned with an assigned goal, performance improved without increasing cognitive load. In contrast, Experiment 2 (n = 515) demonstrated that when a primed goal is misaligned with an assigned goal, performance worsened and cognitive load increased. Study 3, a quasi-field experiment with 315 working professionals, added internal and external validities to the prior experiments. We also examined task novelty and complexity as boundary conditions. For novel tasks (Experiments 1 and 2), when perceptions of task complexity increased, the positive effect of an aligned primed goal diminished. However, for a well-practiced task (Experiment 3), increased task complexity did not diminish the positive effect of aligned goals.</content>

    <title>The Impact of Transparency-Inducing Management Information System Use on Employees’ Daily Work Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the impact of management information systems (MIS) on employee performance, emphasizing the role of transparency induced by MIS. The study highlights the importance of balancing transparency with privacy to maximize MIS benefits. Managers should create environments that foster self-directed transparency, where employees have access to their own performance data. This allows employees to self-assess and improve their performance based on accurate and timely information, likely to enhance the positive outcomes of effective MIS use on employee performance. Thus, managers should encourage this type of transparency by providing tools and training that help employees understand and utilize their performance data effectively. In contrast, team-directed transparency induced by MIS should be carefully managed to avoid negative impacts on performance. This kind of transparency can lead to feelings of surveillance and privacy invasion, with negative consequences for the performance outcomes of employees’ MIS use. Managers should therefore be cautious about which and how much performance data are shared among team members, for example, by establishing clear guidelines and policies defining what information is shared among colleagues and how it is used.</content>

    <title>Star Wars: An Empirical Study of Star Performer Turnover and Content Supply on Multisided Streaming Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice AbstractLive-streaming platforms fiercely compete for top content creators, yet little is known about the effects of losing a star performer. This study examines the impact of the 2019 departure of Fortnite streamer Richard Tyler “Ninja” Blevins from Twitch to Mixer. Using a quasi-experimental research design, we find that Ninja’s exit led to a 20.4% decline in content production from peer creators, which reveals a critical spillover effect on content supply. Contrary to concerns that creators would abandon Twitch entirely, our findings suggest that they instead downsized their output. Notably, streamers with diversified content portfolios and larger followings were more resilient to the star’s departure. For platform managers, these results highlight the strategic importance of retaining top creators to sustain both direct and indirect content supply. Managing star departures effectively is crucial for ensuring a stable content ecosystem. Efforts to counteract negative spillovers may include incentivizing content diversification and mitigating reliance on individual stars, for instance, through enhancing visibility and monetization opportunities for midtier creators. Strengthening platform loyalty through long-term incentives might also reduce the risk of sudden exits.</content>

    <title>More Than a Personal Decision: A Relational Theory of Quiet Quitting</title>
    <updated>2025-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Quiet quitting first exploded in social media and has gained considerable traction in media, practitioner, and scholarly outlets. While much of this attention has been focused on why employees quiet quit, there has been less consideration about how it is perceived by their coworkers. Combining insights from relational climate and social networks scholarship, we develop a novel theory about its potential interpersonal consequences. Our theory elucidates how employee quiet quitting and coworker reactions will differ across market pricing, equality matching, and communal sharing climates. We propose that while harmonious relational climates will facilitate the most support from coworkers, these climates will also trigger the most harmful responses when quiet quitting does not eventually dissipate. We also theorize how the collective monitoring and reporting norms that typically develop within these climates will facilitate sanctions via collective forms of mistreatment, such as social undermining and ostracism. Not only does our theory extend the relevant consequences of quiet quitting to include interpersonal ones, but it also therefore explains how seemingly positive climates can inadvertently enable mistreatment. We outline the contributions of our theory to the growing literature on quiet quitting, suggest directions for future research, and offer implications for human resource management practitioners.</content>

    <title>The perils of a soft start: Initial conditions, early strategy selection, and small firm performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article analyzes the impact of initial conditions on firm strategy selection and performance amongst small firms in emerging markets. Leveraging a proprietary dataset from a minibus taxi financier in South Africa, I estimate the impact of lower than expected fuel prices in the first 3 months of operation on a critical strategic choice: asset utilization. Firms receiving this fuel shock are more likely to operate fewer days, drive fewer kilometers, and work fewer hours. This pattern persists beyond the firm's founding and is correlated with worse loan repayment. This result challenges the assumption that smaller firms always benefit from easier founding conditions. Qualitative and survey evidence suggest that firms determine their profitability frontier early in their lifecycle, and lower cost pressure might encourage them to adopt less profitable strategies. The results suggest incentivizing small firms to adopt more profitable strategies early on might positively influence their long‐term survival.Managerial SummarySmall firms in emerging markets represent a substantial portion of global economic activity. However, researchers and policymakers have spent little time considering the importance of these firms' strategic decisions. This article uses a proprietary dataset to explore the early strategic choices of minibus taxi firms in South Africa. Firms exposed to lower‐than‐expected fuel prices in the first 3 months of operation adopt less profitable strategies. Qualitative and survey evidence suggests that firms determine their strategy when they begin operations, and lower variable costs might lead them to adopt less profitable ones. The results suggest incentivizing small firms to adopt more profitable strategies early on might improve performance.</content>

    <title>Lives Versus Livelihoods: The Impact of the Great Recession on Mortality and Welfare</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage spatial variation in the severity of the Great Recession across the United States to examine its impact on mortality and explore the quantitative implications. We estimate that an increase in the unemployment rate of the magnitude of the Great Recession reduces the average annual age-adjusted mortality rate by 2.3 percent, with effects persisting for at least 10 years. Mortality reductions appear across causes of death and are concentrated in the half of the population with a high school degree or less. We estimate similar percentage reductions in mortality at all ages, with declines in elderly mortality thus responsible for about three-quarters of the total mortality reduction. Recession-induced mortality declines are driven primarily by external effects of reduced aggregate economic activity on mortality, and reduced air pollution appears to be a quantitatively important mechanism. Incorporating our estimates of pro-cyclical mortality into a standard macroeconomics framework substantially reduces the welfare costs of recessions, particularly for people with less education, and at older ages.</content>

    <title>“Why I Searched Alone”: Understanding Mothers’ Hesitation to Seek Network Assistance During Workforce Reentry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although prevalent network theories posit that job seekers are motivated to utilize networks for instrumental benefits, we argue that sociopsychological barriers can discourage network use even when access is readily available. We examine this overlooked dynamic by exploring how sociopsychological factors influence network activation among mothers reentering the workforce after child-related career breaks. Analyzing panel data from a representative sample of Korean job seekers, we find that these mothers are markedly less inclined to use network-based search methods than other groups of women. This inclination remains when we account for individual fixed effects, employment gap length, and potential network disturbances. To uncover the reasons behind this distinct job-search behavior, we conducted in-depth interviews with 60 mothers who experienced child-related employment breaks and 38 other individuals, including mothers without such breaks, nonmothers, and fathers. Whereas existing theories attribute limited network use to restricted access, our qualitative evidence reveals deeper sociopsychological hurdles: mothers often anticipate challenges in reciprocating job-related assistance and the potential revelation of their inferior status when seeking help. These multifaceted internal conflicts not only hamper mothers’ swift reintegration into the labor force but also nudge them toward roles for which they are overqualified. As we bridge these findings, we identify novel theoretical avenues for future research, underscoring how sociopsychological hurdles to network activation can produce gender inequalities in the labor market.Funding: Support from the Wharton Dean’s Research Fund and Wharton’s Center for Human Resources.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ambiguities in Average Speed of Answer TargetsStaffing problems are often formulated as satisfization problems, in which the cost of servers is minimized subject to quality of service constraints. These constraints are intended to capture customers’ disutility from waiting or, at least, its structure. In “What’s in a constraint? On the ambiguity of standard delay targets,” Soh and Gurvich show that such targets—especially the popular average speed of answer—are ambiguous: they give rise to multiple optimal solutions (prioritization policies), each consistent with different assumptions about how customers value their time. By choosing, among all optimal solutions, the one that minimizes a weighted index of diversion (a generalization of variance for the multiclass queue), a service provider can ensure that its ASA-based staffing and prioritization decisions align with a convex model of customer delay disutility. Nonambiguity can also be enforced by restricting attention to fixed queue ratio priority policies.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Uncertainty About Future Accounting Standards on Financial Reporting Quality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Financial statement preparers frequently trade off the benefit of reporting biased estimates with potential penalties for misreporting. In making this trade-off, preparers often face uncertainty about potential changes to accounting standards (“standard-setting uncertainty”) that could affect the future benefits of biased reporting. Our experiment documents two novel behavioral effects of standard-setting uncertainty on preparers’ estimates. First, standard-setting uncertainty causes preparers to make less biased estimates, even though reduced bias conflicts with their financial incentives in our setting. Second, standard-setting uncertainty increases preparers’ sensitivity to measurement imprecision, which is important for high-quality financial reporting. Although standard-setting uncertainty is often criticized, our theory and results suggest that increased financial reporting quality can be an unanticipated benefit of the uncertainty that naturally arises from a measured and deliberative standard-setting process.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: Research funding was provided by The University of Arizona, The University of Texas at Austin, and Cornell University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01469 .</content>

    <title>The Performance Effects of Giving Front-Line Employees Direct Access to Performance Data and Thereby Limiting the Supervisor’s Feedback-Intermediation Role: Evidence from a Field Experiment</title>
    <updated>2025-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Ethan Bernstein, Shelley Xin Li</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how giving front-line employees direct access to their performance data affects performance. To explore that impact, we conducted a field experiment at a service organization that made employees’ daily time-use analytics—previously available only to supervisors—simultaneously available to the employees themselves. We find, compared with the preintervention mean value, a significant treatment effect (an 11% decrease) in nonproductive time relative to the control group. That time, however, flows not strictly to productive (revenue-generating) activities but largely to the most convenient outlets, suggesting—as supported by our qualitative evidence—that data transparency on average shifted behavior more toward avoiding nonproductive activities than toward approaching productive activities. (As one participant observed, it led people to “conform, not excel.”) We examine three relational factors we believed, based on prior feedback research, could moderate the performance effect: perceived supervisor support, social comparison orientation, and work motivation type. Performance improvements are greater for employees who perceived their supervisors as less supportive and for those with low intrinsic motivation or high extrinsic motivation; we fail to find a moderating effect of social comparison orientation. Therefore, although we identify the avoidance (although not approach) value of transparent performance data, our results also tell a nuanced story about the supervisor’s optimal role in delivering feedback: The ability to shift people away from “bad” and toward other uses of time depends on the employee’s perception of supervisor quality and the employee’s motivation type.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, organizations.Funding: We are grateful to the Division of Research and Faculty Development at the Harvard Business School and the USC Marshall School of Business for funding this research.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02395 .</content>

    <title>Ideation with Generative AI—in Consumer Research and Beyond</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The use of generative AI (genAI) in consumer research is rapidly evolving, with applications including synthetic data generation, data analysis, and more. However, their role in creative ideation—a cornerstone of consumer research—remains underexplored. Drawing on the human creativity literature, we propose that ideation with genAI is facilitated by its productivity and semantic breadth, which are psychologically analogous to the dual pathways of persistence and flexibility in human ideation. Further, we distinguish between the utility of genAI as a key ideator versus humans as key ideator, conceptualized through the genAI ideation roles of Designer and Writer and of Interviewer and Actor. While genAI excels in generating incremental improvements, its potential for groundbreaking innovation could be unlocked by leveraging its ability to prompt human creativity. This article advances the theoretical and practical understanding of genAI in ideation for consumer research, offering numerous practical guidelines for integrating generative AI into research while emphasizing human–AI collaboration to achieve radical insights.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a novel generative AI (GenAI) trajectory, “democratization-average trap-model collapse,” to identify data and model challenges posed by GenAI, from which we project the GenAI future of consumer research. This trajectory consists of three key phenomena: democratization broadens consumer participation, the average trap produces generic responses, and model collapse occurs when GenAI outputs lose human sensibilities. Data and model challenges arise as democratization enhances data representation while also embedding real-world biases. The average trap, caused by next-token prediction models, leads to generic outputs that lack individuality. Additionally, model collapse occurs when GenAI increasingly learns from its own outputs, amplifying machine bias and diverging from human behavior. To address these challenges, researchers can leverage democratization to study marginalized consumers and prioritize human-centered research over purely data-driven methods. The average trap can be mitigated by fine-tuning models with task-specific and marginalized consumption data while engineering responses for uniqueness. Preventing model collapse requires integrating human–machine hybrid data and applying theories of mind to realign AI with human-centric consumption. Finally, we outline three future research directions: preserving data distribution tails to support consumption democratization, countering the average trap in next-token prediction, and reversing the trajectory from democratization to model collapse.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Explorations of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) have moved to the forefront of consumer research, as scholars examine its implications for ideation and conceptualization, data collection and analysis, and writing and publishing. Introducing this special section of the Journal of Consumer Research on GenAI and consumer research, the author calls for a critical—and self-critical—engagement with GenAI, calling on researchers to embrace its potential while remaining mindful of both its constraints and their own biases.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has introduced new possibilities for both the creation and analysis of language, which is one key input for consumer culture researchers who analyze qualitative and textual data. How can consumer culture researchers use GenAI to produce insights and work with qualitative data? What are the possibilities and challenges of using these tools? And what are some valuable practices and principles for integrating GenAI into the research process? Building from interviews with researchers who use these tools, the authors identify relevant theoretical, embodied, empirical, and historical contextual dimensions that produce opportunities and challenges for human–AI collaboration. The authors then propose a set of collaborative practices and offer practical guidelines for using GenAI to generate novel and meaningful insights into consumer culture and society.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online sales of limited inventory such as flash sales and lightning deals have become popular among e-commerce retailers including Amazon and eBay. This study focuses on the retailer’s best timing of disclosing inventory information to maximize the expected sales in a finite horizon. We consider how two prominent customer mechanisms, herding effect and scarcity effect, affect the relative performance of different policies. We analyze the following common policies in practice: “always disclose,” “never disclose,” and the fixed threshold policy, which broadcasts the inventory level once it drops below a predetermined level. We also propose a novel time-dependent threshold policy, which we prove to be the optimal policy under reasonable assumptions. We devise efficient algorithms to optimize the policy parameters, and we compare all policies through a numerical study. We find that both threshold policies significantly outperform the two simple policies. Moreover, herding effect and scarcity effect have significant impacts on the relative performance of different policies. Our study provides not only effective and efficient algorithms for policy optimization but also guidelines for policy selection. Policymakers can refer to our study to identify the most appropriate policy, depending on the relative strength of the two customer mechanisms on the platform.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digital platforms have revolutionized business sectors; however, despite their significant success, platform unicorns remain rare. While extensive research exists on digital platform growth, it is uncertain what entrepreneurial decisions achieve unicorn status. We address the research question of what combination of complementary entrepreneurial decisions increases and decreases the likelihood of becoming a platform unicorn. The study examines 125 digital mental health platform ventures, including 12 unicorns, using the Dealroom database and decision tree methodology. We provide combinations of complementary decisions concerning fundraising timing, funding sources, digital technologies, and business model choices that affect a platform venture's probability of becoming a unicorn. The study offers decision profiles for navigating the uncertainties of the digital age. We discuss implications for strategic entrepreneurship and a judgment‐based approach.Managerial SummaryIn the digital age, achieving unicorn status depends on the right combination of complementary decisions about fundraising timing, funding sources, digital technology, and business model choices. Entrepreneurs dealing with uncertainty frequently rely on their intuition to make such decisions. Our research complements intuition with evidence that can now be obtained by deploying artificial intelligence tools like decision trees and highlights complementary decision profiles that have a higher likelihood of becoming unicorns, such as profiles with early‐stage funding, no government funding, and deep tech serving the B2B market. Conversely, we identify combinations with less than 1% success rates, indicating failed judgments. Research insights can help entrepreneurs and investors make better‐informed decisions to enhance mental health platform venture success and be aware of possible failure.</content>

    <title>Expectations and Exits: The Effect of CEO Agency and Communion on Boards’ Expectancy Violations and Dismissal of CEOs Following Breaches of Stakeholder Rights</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How well CEOs manage and protect their stakeholders’ interests has risen as an important criterion in boards’ evaluation of CEOs. Research supports this notion by showing that CEOs who underinvest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) often face bleak job prospects. Therefore, when firms are involved in regulatory sanctions concerning stakeholders’ interests, CEOs may face the risk of dismissal, albeit to different degrees because boards may interpret such events in light of their expectations of CEOs’ stakeholder orientation. We suggest that these expectations are in part formed by boards’ perception of CEOs’ agency and communion—fundamental and distinct motives that signal CEOs’ differential commitment to personal competence, independence, control, and managing relationships with stakeholders. Building upon expectancy violations theory, we argue that following stakeholder-related regulatory sanctions, a CEO faces a higher likelihood of dismissal when perceived by the board as more communal or less agentic but a lower likelihood of dismissal when perceived as more agentic or less communal. We also posit that such tendencies hinge on firms’ CSR efforts and media sentiment, which further affect boards’ expectations of CEOs’ stakeholder management. A series of analyses shows strong support for our predictions, offering novel insights into the role of CEOs’ agency and communion in influencing CEOs’ career outcomes following stakeholder regulatory sanctions.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.17114 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Routing a Vehicle to Collect Data After an EarthquakeIn the immediate aftermath of a major earthquake, it is crucial to quickly and accurately assess structural damage throughout the region. It is especially important to identify buildings that have become unsafe in order to prioritize evacuation efforts. Only a very small number of building inspections can be feasibly performed in a narrow time frame; however, their results can then be combined with other data sources to predict damage at other locations that were not inspected. In “D-Optimal Orienteering for Postearthquake Reconnaissance Planning,” Wang, Xie, Ryzhov, Marković, and Ou present a novel nonlinear integer program that combines vehicle routing with a statistical objective, the goal being to maximize data quality. An exact method based on row and column generation is developed to solve problems with up to 200 buildings. The approach is validated in a realistic case study using real-world building data obtained from a state-of-the-art earthquake simulator.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate a structural, nominal, life-cycle portfolio choice model with exogenous housing tenure and use shopping costs to generate money demand. Homeowners (renters) with negative (positive) net bond positions react differently to changing inflation risks. The correlation between real bond and real stock returns emerges as the strongest inflation risk quantitatively and generates large increases in stock market demand for homeowners in a 1970s counterfactual. Higher expected inflation encourages stock market participation but affects negatively poorer households without access to that adjustment. A more negative inflation-bond return correlation pushes homeowners more into the stock market, whereas poorer renters move into money.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02007 .</content>

    <title>Uncertain Search with Knowledge Transfer</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a sequential search over a group of similar alternatives. The individual value of an alternative contains two components: an observable utility and an idiosyncratic value. Observable utilities share an unknown population distribution, which captures the similarity across the alternatives and allows for knowledge transfer within the group. Once a decision maker encounters an alternative, its utility is revealed immediately, whereas the idiosyncratic value is unobservable and needs to be learned by sampling. The goal is to select an alternative with the highest individual value, accounting for the sampling and search costs. A novel feature of this problem is the combination of the individual and population levels of learning. We formulate the problem as a Bayesian dynamic program and characterize the optimal policy by a threshold structure. We show that it depends on the difference between the mean estimates of the current alternative and the population. It is optimal to continue sampling if the difference is between a threshold pair; otherwise, accept the current alternative if it exceeds the upper threshold, and switch to a new one if it is below the lower threshold. Other structural properties are also derived to shed light on the effects of the two levels of learning. A key insight is that more uncertainty is preferable at the individual level, but less uncertainty is preferable at the population level. Various practical variants of the problem are also considered.This paper was accepted by Ilia Tsetlin, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: W. T.

    <title>Steering a Ship in Illiquid Waters: Active Management of Passive Funds</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are typically viewed as passive index trackers. In contrast, we show that corporate bond ETFs actively manage their portfolios, trading off index tracking against liquidity transformation. In our model, ETFs optimally choose creation and redemption baskets that include cash and only a subset of index assets, especially if those assets are illiquid. Our evidence supports the model. We find that ETFs dynamically adjust their baskets to correct portfolio imbalances while facilitating ETF arbitrage. Basket inclusion improves bond liquidity in general, but worsens it in periods of large imbalance between creations and redemptions, such as the COVID-19 crisis. (JEL G12, G23)</content>

    <title>Industry Tournament Incentives and the U.S. Financial Systemic Risk</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by Coles, Li, and Wang (2020)’s prediction that industry tournament incentives are linked to heightened risk-seeking behavior, we examine whether these incentives contribute positively to systemic risk. Using a measure of systemic risk that captures the cross-sectional tail-dependency between the U.S. financial system and individual financial institutions, we find that the external pay gap is positively related to an institution’s contribution to systemic risk. Consistent with our expectation, industry tournament incentives are positively associated with individual financial institutions’ stock return volatility, Value at Risk, and crash risk, thus indirectly contributing to systemic risk due to financial institutions’ inherent interconnectedness. More interestingly, the external pay gap is positively related to an institution’s financial industry beta and encourages systemically risky activities, suggesting an important impact channel through institutions’ undertaking correlated activities.</content>

    <title>Bank Compensation for the Penalty-Free Loan Prepayment Option: Theory and Evidence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While it is standard for corporate bonds to include a loan cancellation fee, a surprising 90% of tranche A commercial and industrial term loans allow borrowers to prepay the loan without penalty. We use a simple framework with dynamic learning to derive testable implications for the required bank compensation when including a penalty-free prepayment option. In this framework, after loan origination, borrowers receive noncontractible public information about the value of the project funded by the bank loan. This information causes some ex post high-value borrowers to prepay or renegotiate the loan to obtain a lower rate, deteriorating the credit quality of the bank’s remaining borrower pool. To avoid credit rationing of borrowers with a high prepayment risk, we show that the bank’s compensation must be in the form of an upfront fee rather than a higher initial loan rate, as the latter only exacerbates the adverse prepayment incentive. The model also accounts for the possibility that in relationship lending, an upfront fee may dominate a loan cancellation fee when the latter triggers costly ex post bargaining with high-value clients. To test model predictions, we construct a prepayment risk index, which contains proxies for borrower upside potential and loan renegotiation costs, and we use aggregate industry-level merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity as an instrument for exogenous variation in loan prepayment risk. The tests support that upfront fees increase with borrower prepayment risk. In addition, upfront fees are lower for credit lines and loans with performance-sensitive pricing, as predicted.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Funding: Partial financial support from Tuck’s Lindenauer Forum for Corporate Governance (Eckbo) and from the Norwegian Research Council [Grant 273678] (Thorburn and Su) is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00159 .</content>

    <title>Contextual Learning with Online Convex Optimization: Theory and Application to Medical Decision-Making</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Optimizing the treatment regimen is a fundamental medical decision-making problem. This can be thought of as a two-dimensional decision-making problem with a nested structure because it involves determining both the optimal medication and its optimal dose. Identifying the most effective medication for an individual often poses considerable difficulty, and even when a suitable medication is ascertained, dosing it optimally remains a significant challenge. Making these two nested decisions necessitates the adaptive learning of a personalized disease progression control model. To address this problem, we propose a novel contextual multiarmed bandit model under a two-dimensional control with a nested structure. For this model, we develop a new joint contextual learning and optimization algorithm, termed the stochastic subgradient descent atop contextual multiarmed bandit (SGD-MAB) algorithm. It sequentially selects for a patient (i) the best medication based on their contextual information and (ii) the corresponding dose optimized over the prior history of those patients who received the same medication. We prove that it admits a sublinear regret, which is tight up to a logarithmic factor. Our regret analysis leverages the strengths of both contextual bandit approaches and online convex optimization techniques in a seamless fashion. We substantiate the practicality of SGD-MAB using clinical data on patients with hypertension and heightened cardiovascular risks. Our analysis indicates that SGD-MAB has the potential to surpass current practices. We benchmark several policies to show the advantages of our approach and offer critical insights. Our framework holds promise for various applications beyond healthcare that require nested decision-making.This paper was accepted by J.

    <title>Indigenous peoples’ reactions to foreign direct investment: a social movement perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A growing body of literature highlights that large-scale investments in sensitive contexts can undermine both firm financial performance and peace-positive development. We investigate whether and under what conditions foreign direct investment (FDI) proximate to Indigenous land claims increases or decreases conflict. Drawing on social movement theory’s identification of powerful frames and political opportunity structures as drivers of mobilization, we predict that FDI proximate to Indigenous land claims will promote conflict. We leverage novel data on the global location of Indigenous land claims and a global corpus of more than 4 billion news articles. We find that when locations with Indigenous land claims are treated with FDI, we observe an increase in media-reported armed conflict events. We further argue and find this effect to be driven by rebels acting on behalf of Indigenous people who target (multinational) corporations and the governments who offer them the formal license to operate. These negative effects are found across a wide range of industries. Our results underscore that for investments in sensitive socio-political contexts, such as Indigenous lands, firm performance and the livelihoods of community members are heavily influenced by conflict risk mitigation efforts.</content>

    <title>“Extortionality” in Ransomware Attacks: A Microeconomic Study of Extortion and Externality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractRansomware attacks have emerged as one of the biggest threats to cybersecurity. Faced with business disruptions, many organizations accede to ransom demands, and in doing so, they embolden the attackers to launch more attacks, elevating the chance of a future breach for others. We study this externality using a multiperiod game among multiple firms, each of which has a choice to pay or not pay if breached in a particular period, its action having implications for future periods. How should a policymaker intervene to mitigate this externality, and is prohibition necessary? What might work or how it might work as a policy tool depends critically on the behavior of the attacker (extortionist). If the attacker is not strategic, fiscal interventions could work, and a complete prohibition on ransom payment is unnecessary. If the attackers are strategic, though, they may respond to the policymaker’s tax/subsidy in a manner that could increase victims’ propensity to pay, rendering fiscal intervention ineffective as a policy lever. In such a case, prohibition may be the only way to mitigate the externality. Overall, our analysis provides a framework for comparing different types of policy interventions and raises concerns for policymakers and social planners to pause and ponder.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study reveals how incumbent actors leverage physical place as a source of differentiation in response to the threat of digital commoditization. Through a longitudinal, qualitative analysis of the U.S. independent bookselling industry from 1995 to 2019, we outline how dispersed organizational actors responded to the rise of Amazon.com, an online retailer that threatened to displace brick-and-mortar retail. While many analysts predicted that Amazon’s emergence would incite a retail apocalypse, independent bookstores proved to be far more resilient than expected. We identify organizational emplacement—a process by which actors infuse meaning into physicalspaces, thereby transforming them into valuableplaces—as a novel mechanism of value creation. Several practices are associated with this mechanism, including architecting the physical environment, anchoring to the local community, and sanctifying the meaning of place. This study offers a counterbalance to narratives of digital displacement and shows how physical place can be converted from a liability into an asset in the digital era.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The view that a business unit can better compete against product-market rivals if granted funding from its parent firm’s internal capital market (ICM) has lost traction within strategy, despite conflicting evidence. We develop a theory to explain when funding from a parent firm’s ICM should enable a business unit to more effectively capture value (i.e., profit) from its investment opportunities under product-market competition. We depart from prior theories by examining how opportunities relate to competition. Specifically, we propose a typology of opportunities along two strategic dimensions. The first dimension is firm-specificity, a concept derived from the resource-based view. It refers to whether an opportunity stems from unique firm resources and capabilities and is therefore exclusive to a business unit rather than shared with (and contestable by) its product-market rivals. The second dimension is uncertainty about the investment path, a concept derived from the literature on investment under uncertainty and real options. When present, it is impossible (and undesirable) to commit upfront to a fully predetermined set of investments in an opportunity. These dimensions imply that different opportunities may have distinct critical needs in terms of funding—such as secrecy, timeliness, and reliability—that must be satisfied for a business unit to capture value. Ultimately, our theory indicates that receiving funding from a parent firm’s ICM increases a business unit’s chances of capturing value when those critical needs are present, suggesting that units with ICM funding may prevail in some competitive environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop anex antemeasure of commercial potential of science, an otherwise unobservable variable driving the performance of innovation‐intensive firms. To do so, we rely on large language models and neural networks to predict whether scientific articles will influence firms' use of science. Incorporating time‐varying models and the quantification of uncertainty, the measure is validated through both traditional methods and out‐of‐sample exercises, leveraging a major university's technology transfer data. To illustrate the methodological contributions of our measure, we apply it to examining the impact of university reputation and university privatization of science, finding that firms' reliance on reputation may lead to foregone opportunities, and privatization (i.e., patenting) appears to increase firms' use of the science of one university. We make our measure and method available to researchers.Managerial SummaryUsing machine learning, we develop a measure that estimates the probability that a scientific discovery will contribute to a commercially valuable innovation. This work addresses a key challenge: the inability to observe what scientific discoveries are worth pushing forward into commercial application. We illustrate the usefulness of this measure with two examples: 1.) firms’ use of research from prestigious universities over equally promising work from less prominent ones; and 2.) how patenting affects the diffusion of commercially relevant science across firms. For practitioners, this measure can inform R&amp;D, licensing, and other innovation related decisions by guiding firms’ search for commercially relevant scientific research. The measure and the associated code are publicly available.</content>

    <title>How Ideologically Opposed Stakeholders Influence Organizational Practice Adoption: Theory and Evidence from the Diffusion of Domestic Partner Benefits in Higher Education</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the concept of ideologically opposed stakeholders and its implications for the adoption and justification of contentious organizational practices. When organizations face stakeholders who oppose the ideological content of a new organizational practice, we theorize that this opposition causes organizations to emulate prior adopters whose animating values resonate with these opposed stakeholders. We further argue that if they adopt the practice that their stakeholders oppose, such organizations will be more apt to rhetorically justify the practice in a way that resonates with those opposed stakeholders’ values. Using the adoption of same-sex domestic partner benefits among U.S. public universities as our empirical setting, we find support for these ideas. When universities have conservative state policymakers (a key opposed stakeholder), this reality amplifies the university’s emulation of proximally headquartered for-profit corporations and at the same time, weakens their emulation of other universities in their intercollegiate sports network. Universities facing conservative policymakers are also more likely to issue market-based (as opposed to social equity-based) justifications when announcing domestic partner benefits adoption. These findings contribute to organizational research on diffusion, political ideology, stakeholders, and nonmarket strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.17219 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The signature transform is a powerful tool for feature extraction in time series analysis, yet its statistical properties remain underexplored. In their paper in Operations Research, Guo et al. examine the consistency of signature when used with Lasso regression. The study establishes conditions under which Lasso achieves consistent feature selection, both asymptotically and in finite samples. A key finding is that the Itô signature performs better for processes resembling Brownian motion, whereas the Stratonovich signature is more effective for mean-reverting processes. The authors further demonstrate the practical relevance of their results by applying signature-based Lasso regression to option pricing, highlighting its potential in financial modeling. These insights provide a crucial theoretical foundation for improving predictive performance across various domains, including operations research and machine learning.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Marketing Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of a ban on unsolicited store flyers in seven Dutch municipalities that shifted from an opt-out to an opt-in policy between 2018 and 2020. Despite a 50% drop in flyer distribution, household grocery shopping behavior remained largely unchanged. The findings suggest that reducing flyer waste may be possible without substantially disrupting shopping behavior.</content>

    <title>Leveraging Expert Consistency to Improve Algorithmic Decision Support</title>
    <updated>2025-05-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to support high-stakes decisions. However, there is frequently a construct gap: a gap between the construct of interest to the decision-making task and what is captured in proxies used as labels to train ML models. As a result, ML models may fail to capture important dimensions of decision criteria, hampering their utility for decision support. Thus, an essential step in the design of ML systems for decision support is selecting a target label among available proxies. In this work, we explore the use of historical expert decisions as a rich—yet also imperfect—source of information that can be combined with observed outcomes to narrow the construct gap. We argue that managers and system designers may be interested in learning from experts in instances where they exhibit consistency with each other while learning from observed outcomes otherwise. We develop a methodology to enable this goal using information that is commonly available in organizational information systems. This involves two core steps. First, we propose an influence function-based methodology to estimate expert consistency indirectly when each case in the data are assessed by a single expert. Second, we introduce a label amalgamation approach that allows ML models to simultaneously learn from expert decisions and observed outcomes. Our empirical evaluation, using simulations in a clinical setting and real-world data from the child welfare domain, indicates that the proposed approach successfully narrows the construct gap, yielding better predictive performance than learning from either observed outcomes or expert decisions alone.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [Grant R01NS124642], Good Systems, University of Texas at Austin, the Metro 21 Institute, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [Grant FA8750-17-2-0130], the National Science Foundation [Grant 1939606], Google [Award for Inclusion Research], and the UK Medical Research Council [Grants MC UU 00002/2, MC UU 00002/5, and MC UU 00040/02–Precision Medicine].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01576 .</content>

    <title>Lost in the Crowd: How Group Size and Content Moderation Shape User Engagement in Live Streaming</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Live streaming platforms such as Twitch and YouTube Live now play a central role in digital engagement, offering real-time interaction that grows increasingly complex with larger audiences. Our study leverages the exogenous viewer influx from Twitch’s Raid function to examine how increases in group size affect user engagement. Analyzing chat histories from more than 7,000 playbacks using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that although attracting more viewers, larger group sizes also lead to reduced engagement among existing participants. This decline is linked to increased topic incoherence and heightened emotional volatility—or comment polarity—in live chats. Importantly, our results highlight that targeted moderation strategies can mitigate these negative effects. Bot moderators are particularly effective in maintaining coherence during large-scale raids, whereas human moderators better manage emotional surges when the incoming group is smaller. These findings reveal a congestion effect in synchronous digital environments and offer clear practice- and policy-oriented implications: Online synchronous platforms should consider the scalability of viewers and commenters and use flexible moderation strategies to sustain user engagement and foster healthier, more constructive real-time interactions.</content>

    <title>Learning by helping: Evidence from Chinese brokerages' community &lt;scp&gt;CSR&lt;/scp&gt;</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose that firms engaging in community corporate social responsibility (CSR) can acquire valuable local knowledge that improves their core operations. We test our proposition leveraging a unique context‐the Securities Association of China's pairing assistance scheme under the country's targeted poverty alleviation program. Under this scheme, financial brokerage houses conducted community CSR in quasi‐randomly matched impoverished regions. We find support for the local knowledge learning effect of CSR by showing how community CSR participation enabled brokerages to more accurately forecast the earnings of companies in those regions. We complement our quantitative analyses with qualitative data from in‐depth interviews, surveys of brokerage employees, and archival documents. The evidence indicates that forecast accuracy improved when CSR engagements enhanced learning about local companies' capabilities and business environment.Managerial SummaryMany firms engage in community CSR, leveraging their expertise to address issues beyond the capacity of governments and public organizations. Firms can benefit from these CSR efforts, often experiencing performance improvements driven by enhanced corporate reputation and stronger stakeholder relationships. Our research highlights an additional, understudied benefit: CSR can serve as a channel for local knowledge acquisition, whereby firms learn by helping. In a unique context where financial brokerage houses participated in community CSR through quasi‐randomized regional matching, we find that community CSR enabled brokerages to more accurately forecast the earnings of companies in those regions. This improvement occurred because brokerages, through community CSR, gained a deeper understanding of local companies' capabilities and business environment.</content>

    <title>A Stationary Mean-Field Equilibrium Model of Irreversible Investment in a Two-Regime Economy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study firms size distribution in a mean-field model of Cournot competition in a commodity market, where price follows an inverse power demand function. Firms face irreversible investment decisions and constant depreciation of production capacity. Output is affected by Gaussian productivity shocks, whose volatility and the price function can shift due to rare macroeconomic events modeled by a two-state Markov chain. Firms aim to maximize expected discounted profits, net of investment and operating costs, based on the long-run stationary price. We establish existence and uniqueness of a stationary mean-field equilibrium and characterize it through a barrier-type investment strategy with endogenous thresholds for each economic regime. A quasi-closed form for the stationary distribution of firms’ states is provided. The model generates Pareto-distributed firm sizes, consistent with empirical industry data. It also shows that downturns raise market concentration and that firm performance depends on depreciation rates and the persistence of economic fluctuations.</content>

    <title>Strategic Residential Location Choice: How Parents Game Priorities in School Matching</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most school choice matching mechanisms employed in theory and practice assume that schools rank students by characteristics that cannot be manipulated. However, parents may have incentives to misstate information used for determining school priorities, such as the proximity of the residential address to a school, particularly when such misrepresentations are difficult to detect or carry minimal penalties. If manipulation of school priorities occurs, the efficiency and fairness of the matching mechanism may be affected. Using official registration data on 330,000 children from the city of Vienna, I demonstrate that such strategic parental behavior occurs and establish lower bounds for its prevalence. Some parents register their child at a different residential address a few months before applying to a school and change the official residential address back to the original address after the child has been successfully enrolled. Migrants and families with lower education levels are less likely to game the system. A survey among 1,300 parents of first graders suggests that this negatively affects parents and children who are sincere.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: The parents survey was funded by the Institute for Markets and Strategy, Vienna University of Economics and Business.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03711 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In algorithm-augmented service contexts where workers have decision authority, they face two decisions about the algorithm: whether to follow its advice and how quickly to do so. The pressure to work quickly increases with the speed of arriving customers. In this paper, we ask the following. How do workers use algorithms to manage system loads? With a laboratory experiment, we find that superior algorithm quality and high system loads increase participants’ willingness to use their algorithm’s advice. Consequently, participants with the superior algorithm make higher-quality recommendations than those with no algorithm (participants with the inferior algorithm make slightly lower-quality recommendations than those without). However, participants do not necessarily speed up by using algorithms’ advice; their throughput times only decrease compared with the no-algorithm baseline when the system load is high and algorithm quality is superior, although participants would benefit from working faster in all treatments. This happens in part because participants in the high-load, superior-algorithm treatment serve customers more quickly than participants in the other treatments, conditional on using the algorithm. Participants in the high-load, superior-algorithm treatment work especially quickly in later periods as they increasingly default to their algorithm’s advice. Our findings show that algorithms can have benefits for both decision quality and speed. Quality benefits come from workers’ decision to use their algorithms’ advice, whereas speed benefits depend on workers’ algorithm use and the time they spend deliberating about their algorithm use. Ultimately, algorithm quality and system load are mutually reinforcing factors that influence both service quality and especially speed.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01989 .</content>

    <title>Strange Dance Partners: Supply Chain Cyberattacks and Chained Vulnerability</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The concept of “chained vulnerability” addresses the cyberattack risks for organizations through interconnected internal and external actors (e.g., employees and suppliers). As organizational defenses and tactics of antagonistic actors (e.g., hackers) adapt to emerging conditions, certain actors of organizations become compromised as entry points into the targeted organizations. A disruption (i.e., COVID‐19) induces operational changes (i.e., digital transformation), and we study the co‐evolution of attacks and defenses as if the antagonistic actors, organizations, and their internal and external actors are engaged in a dance together. Building on routine activity theory, our study theorizes the adaptive target suitability where the properties of actors, the types of actors involved, and the consequential phases co‐evolve following the disruption. We leverage the COVID‐19 pandemic as the empirical context and use a novel dataset of 3497 publicly reported cyber breaches. Analyses reveal that cyberattacks initially focused on internal actors (i.e., deception‐based attacks on employees) and then shifted to external actors (i.e., system vulnerability‐based attacks on digital infrastructure providers and product suppliers). Semi‐structured interviews with experts (e.g., hackers and cybersecurity managers) and subsequent econometric analyses elucidate how strategic interactions between dance partners lead to disruptions that dynamically reshape the landscape of chained vulnerability.</content>

    <title>Short-Term Fulfillment: How Supervisors’ Motives for Abusive Behaviors Influence Need Satisfaction and Daily Outcomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing research assumes that supervisors invariably feel bad after engaging in abusive behaviors. We challenge this assumption by proposing that supervisors’ motives of abusive supervision shape their post-abuse experiences. Drawing on the social interactionist theory of aggression and theories of self-regulation, we suggest that instrumental (or goal-driven) abusive behaviors provide a temporary sense of fulfillment, whereas spontaneous (or reactive, emotionally-driven) abusive behaviors diminish need satisfaction and foster negative outcomes. Using an exploratory study and an event-contingent experiencing sampling study, we found that supervisors may justify their abuse with effecting compliance motives when subordinates perform poorly, which fulfills task achievement needs and increases next-day work engagement. Similarly, supervisors may also justify their abuse with identity maintenance motives when subordinates are disrespectful, thus enhancing social identity needs and next-day organizational-based self-esteem. We also found that when supervisors justify their abusive behaviors with spontaneous motives (i.e., depletion and negative affect), it has negative implications for need satisfaction and outcomes. Lastly, we highlight supervisor’s psychological power as a boundary condition of these effects. All told, our findings indicate that, at the within-person level, supervisors’ daily motives for abusive behaviors matter, given that certain motives actually yield short-term benefits for supervisors.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Voice AI on Digital Commerce</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research examines the impact of voice-activated shopping assistants, such as Alibaba’s Tmall Genie, on consumer behavior in online shopping. Analyzing real-world purchase data using econometric models, this work finds that the average consumer’s weekly spending on Alibaba increased by 16.6% within the first four months after adopting voice AI. Additionally, we explore specific product features that moderate the effect of Genie adoption by examining the repeat purchase and product substitutability and familiarity, supporting a mechanism that involves reducing information acquisition costs. The positive effects of Genie adoption remain significant on repeat purchases in the long term, although they attenuate over time. Furthermore, our analyses reveal that on average, the voice channel has a positive spillover effect on spending on the PC channel but no significant effect on the mobile channel. The channel dynamics are contingent on specific shopping contexts. These results demonstrate that voice AI devices with shopping capabilities can enhance the growth of the affiliated e-commerce platform. As the first study to empirically examine the impact of voice AI adoption on e-commerce consumption, our paper provides valuable implications for e-commerce platforms and retailers leveraging voice-activated shopping.</content>

    <title>Tiered status hierarchies and competitive actions</title>
    <updated>2025-05-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Rankings often create tiered status hierarchies—for example, top, middle, and lower status tiers—of the ranked organizations. We study how an organization's position within a tier, particularly near tier boundaries, influences its competitive behavior. We propose atier‐aspiration effect, where those at the top of a lower tier pursue more and riskier competitive actions to advance to the higher tier, and atier‐maintenance effect, where those at the bottom a tier engage in more and riskier competitive actions to maintain their position when there is a greater threat from competitors at the top of the neighboring lower tier. Empirical analyses of Korean business groups' rankings and acquisitions between 2001 and 2018 support these predictions, revealing how positional differences shape competitive actions within tiered status hierarchies.Managerial SummaryRankings often group organizations into tiers—like top, middle, and lower tiers—but not all companies within a tier behave the same. We analyze acquisitions of Korean business groups ranked in an asset‐based ranking and find that firms near the top or bottom of a tier act more competitively than those in the middle. More specifically, those at the top of a lower tier tend to engage in greater and more unrelated acquisitions to move up to a higher tier. Meanwhile, those just above a tier cut‐off engage in greater and more unrelated acquisitions to retain their tier position, especially if they face strong competition from below. These insights can help managers better understand how rankings drive competitive behavior, beyond economic motivations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide novel evidence that aggregate investor attention to stocks predicts marketwide returns, but with a striking difference across investor clienteles. Daily aggregate retail attention (ARA) negatively predicts one-week-ahead market returns, is associated with aggregate retail order imbalance and flows to equity mutual funds, and exhibits a stronger predictability during periods of high marketwide uncertainty, poor liquidity, or more costly short selling. In contrast, aggregate institutional attention (AIA), when observed before major news announcements, positively predict future marketwide returns. In cross-sectional analysis, we show that the predictability is stronger for ARA among illiquid stocks and for AIA among high-beta stocks. The predictability results are robust out-of-sample and correspond to meaningful expected utility gains even for diversified investors. The findings are consistent with the idea that attention-driven retail buying can generate an aggregate price pressure on the stock market, whereas institutional attention precedes the resolution of marketwide uncertainty and the accrual of risk premiums.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Funding: J.

    <title>Beyond IID: Data-Driven Decision Making in Heterogeneous Environments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How should one leverage historical data when past observations are not perfectly indicative of the future, for example, because of the presence of unobserved confounders which one cannot “correct” for? Motivated by this question, we study a data-driven decision-making framework in which historical samples are generated from unknown and different distributions assumed to lie in a heterogeneity ball with known radius and centered around the (also) unknown future (out-of-sample) distribution on which the performance of a decision will be evaluated. This work aims to analyze the performance of central data-driven policies and also near-optimal ones in these heterogeneous environments, and it aims to understand key drivers of performance. We establish a first result that allows us to upper bound the asymptotic worst-case regret of a broad class of policies. Leveraging this result, for any integral probability metric, we provide a general analysis of the performance achieved by sample average approximation (SAA) as a function of the radius of the heterogeneity ball. This analysis is centered around the approximation parameter, a notion of complexity we introduce to capture how the interplay between the heterogeneity and the problem structure impacts the performance of SAA. In turn, we illustrate, through several widely studied problems—for example, newsvendor, pricing—how this methodology can be applied and find that the performance of SAA varies considerably depending on the combinations of problem classes and heterogeneity. The failure of SAA for certain instances motivates the design of alternative policies to achieve rate optimality. We derive problem-dependent policies achieving strong guarantees for the illustrative problems described above and provide initial results toward a principled approach for the design and analysis of general rate-optimal algorithms.This paper was accepted by Vivek Farias, data science.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03448 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a general simulation-based procedure for estimating the quality of approximate policies in heterogeneous-agent equilibrium models, which allows us to verify that such approximate solutions describe a near-rational equilibrium. Our procedure endows agents with superior knowledge of the future path of the economy, while imposing a suitable penalty for such foresight. The relaxed problem is more tractable than the original, and results in an upper bound on agents’ welfare. Our method applies to various solution algorithms. We illustrate our approach in two applications: the incomplete-markets model of Krusell and Smith (1998) and the heterogeneous firm model of Khan and Thomas (2008).

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Markdown Policies for Demand Learning with Forward-Looking CustomersDemand uncertainty and forward-looking customer behavior pose substantial challenges for sellers. In “Markdown policies for demand learning with forward-looking customers,” Birge, Chen, and Keskin analyze a markdown pricing problem involving demand model uncertainty and strategic customers. The authors identify that strategic customer behavior creates a strong intertemporal dependence, where early markdowns influence later demand outcomes. They characterize the impact of this intertemporal dependence on demand learning and develop near-optimal policies that judiciously delay markdowns to manage forward-looking customer behavior while ensuring efficient learning.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;ORLM: Pioneering Open-Source Framework for Automated Optimization ModelingA study titled "ORLM: A Customizable Framework in Training Large Models for Automated Optimization Modeling" has been published, introducing the first open-source framework designed to automate optimization modeling using large language models (LLMs). This innovative approach addresses critical challenges in the field of operations research (OR), particularly the overreliance on closed-source LLMs like GPT-4, which raises privacy concerns and limits customization in industrial applications.The research team proposed OR-Instruct, a semiautomated data synthesis framework that generates high-quality training data tailored to specific optimization modeling requirements. They also introduced IndustryOR, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs’ performance on real-world OR problems. By training several 7B-scale open-source LLMs with the synthesized data, the team achieved state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, including NL4Opt, MAMO, and IndustryOR.This advancement not only enhances the accessibility and applicability of optimization modeling, but also paves the way for more efficient and privacy-conscious solutions in various industrial sectors. The ORLM framework exemplifies the potential of open-source initiatives in driving innovation and democratizing advanced analytical tools for operations research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that public charities with corporate directors on their boards are more likely to lobby on behalf of connected corporate interests. We document this result using granular fixed effects and alternative measures, excluding donor firms, focusing on specific legislation bills, and shocks to board connections. The effects of connections are stronger when firms face more competition, have better corporate governance, and are more exposed to political risks. Through connected charity lobbying, firms enjoy political benefits in the form of governmental procurement contracts. Policies aimed at improving the transparency of nonprofits help discipline charities who would otherwise seek funding benefits through procorporate lobbying activities. Our results highlight directors’ charitable engagement as a complementary avenue for corporate political activities.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00165 .</content>

    <title>Is Relevancy Everything? A Deep-Learning Approach to Understand the Effect of Image-Text Congruence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms increasingly use a combination of image and text description when displaying products and engaging consumers. Existing research has examined consumers’ response to text and image stimuli separately but has yet to systematically consider how the semantic relationship between image and text impacts consumer choice. In this research, we conduct a series of multimethod empirical studies to examine the congruence between image- and text-based product representation. First, we propose a deep-learning approach to measure image-text congruence by building a state-of-the-art two-branch neural network model based on wide residual networks and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers. Next, we apply our method to data from an online reading platform and discover a U-shaped effect of image-text congruence: Consumers’ preference toward a product is higher when the congruence between the image and text representation is either high or low than when the congruence is at the medium level. We then conduct experiments to establish the causal effect of this finding and explore the underlying mechanisms. We further explore the generalizability of the proposed deep-learning model and our substantive finding in two additional settings. Our research contributes to the literature on consumer information processing and generates managerial implications for practitioners on how to strategically pair images and text on digital platforms.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Funding: J.

    <title>EXPRESS: Sustainable Product Profit Potential and Availability</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers have become more interested in purchasing products produced using more sustainable practices, with much of the recent growth in consumer-packaged goods (CPGs) within the United States from products with clearly labeled sustainability claims on their packaging. However, many categories have low levels of sustainable product market share, with substantial geographic variation. We assess the role of demographic variables on the availability of sustainable products, after controlling for their relative “profit potential” (determined by quantity, price, and price elasticity). To estimate profit potential, we estimate product and county-specific demand elasticities for seven CPG subcategories in the grocery and mass merchandiser formats. A meta-analysis of the estimates show that the relative profit potential of sustainable products increases with income and Democratic vote share. These variables predict greater sustainable product availability than would be expected from their higher profit potential. The fraction of the county that is white does not significantly impact profit potential but leads to higher sustainable product availability. Our findings provide evidence that managers likely use simple demographic heuristics to make product stocking decisions (supported by a separate survey of retailers) that do not necessarily reflect preferences for sustainable products and their profitability.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Dynamic Effects of TV Ad Suspension on Keyword Search: Evidence from the U.S. Telecom Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates the dynamic effects of temporarily suspending TV ads on online keyword search through a large-scale quasi-experiment in the U.S. wireless telecom industry. One top carrier, which spends stably around one million USD per day on TV advertising, halted its TV ads for a randomly selected week over our (6-month) study window. The primary challenges in this event study — continuously changing treatment variables and establishing valid control groups to account for time-varying confounders—are addressed using the generalized synthetic control estimator (GSC). Findings reveal significant immediate and lasting declines in the focal brand’s search volume, with reductions of 5-15% per day persisting for two weeks after TV ads resumed. The effects varied significantly across search categories: informational searches related to TV ad content experienced drops of up to 30% per day but recovered more quickly, while navigational searches showed smaller but more prolonged declines. Furthermore, the intervention had modest, short-lived spillover effects on three competitors. Interestingly, the suspension tended to hurt the competitor most similar to the focal brand, while benefiting leading competitors. These spillover effects were particularly pronounced in informational and channel searches, suggesting that competitors’ visibility was significantly affected by the focal brand’s absence.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Automated versus Human Agents: A Meta-Analysis of Customer Responses to Robots, Chatbots, and Algorithms and Their Contingencies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This meta-analysis examines when three types of automated agents (AAs)—robots, chatbots, and algorithms—are equivalent to human agents (HAs) in marketing roles. Analyzing 943 effect sizes from 327 studies provides novel insights. First, customers may be skeptical of AAs; however, they value their performance and eventually choose or buy from them as if they were interacting with HAs. Second, each of the three AA types has a unique set of contingencies that affect its human equivalence; previously identified contingencies do not generalize and can even have opposing effects across AA types. This study also identifies novel contingencies, such as the multifaceted concept of artificial intelligence required to fulfill a task. Third, some contingencies make AAs more humanlike, while others make their machine characteristics salient. These findings enrich the concept of automated social presence (ASP), suggesting that AAs are hybrid beings with a social presence (i.e., the feeling of interacting with a humanlike entity) and an automated presence (i.e., the feeling of interacting with a machine entity). The authors provide recommendations on when AAs can replace HAs in marketing roles to release capacity and alleviate labor shortages. They also suggest a future research agenda.</content>
