    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employer reviews (i.e., online workplace ratings authored by employees) attract broad interest and shape the opinions of potential employees. Thus, companies face the challenge of dealing with these workplace judgments that are outside their direct control. While prevailing theoretical perspectives suggest that responding to third‐party judgments may be an effective way for companies to deal with them, they focus on responses to negative judgments that threaten companies' reputations. Based on signaling theory, we argue that employer responsiveness, signaled by an employer's first response to an employer review, serves as a mechanism of indirect control over employer reviews. Applying a difference‐in‐differences approach—a statistical technique to estimate the causal effect of the treatment (i.e., responsiveness) by comparing it to a control group without the treatment—on a sample of 298,269 reviews of 21,099 employers over 45 quarters posted on the employer review website Kununu, we hypothesize and find that compared to nonresponsive employers, responsive employers receive more diverse (i.e., variety of topics covered) and extensive (i.e., amount of information provided) employer reviews. These effects are especially pronounced in the case of negative employer reviews. Our findings can serve as a guide for employers in dealing with third‐party judgments by demonstrating that employer responsiveness is a valuable signal enhancing online review quality. We contribute to the growing body of HRM research on employer reputation on social media, a critical factor influencing recruitment and retention outcomes. Our study opens new avenues for research to explore the role of responsiveness as a strategic signal in employer brand management.</content>

    <title>Keep Up the Good Work… or Else! Exploring Supervisor Responses to Quiet Quitting</title>
    <updated>2025-06-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A Google search of “quiet quitting” yields over 350 million results, which is remarkable given that the term is only a few years old. Although quiet quitting is a relatively new trend, the concept it describes—an employee's conscious decision to do the bare minimum in their job rather than going above and beyond—is familiar to researchers who have investigated organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). However, for those interested in the effective management of human resources, what is important—yet unknown—is how managers respond to employees who engage in quiet quitting. Therefore, in this conceptual paper, we use attribution theory to explore supervisor responses to employees who engage in quiet quitting and subsequently withhold OCB. We propose that supervisors will generally have negative reactions to employees' withholding OCB, but we further explain how evaluations of locus, controllability, and stability and principles of discounting and augmenting influence supervisor attributions. Finally, implications for human resource theory, research, and practice are discussed.</content>

    <title>Data Donations for Digital Contact Tracing: Short- and Long-Term Effects of Monetary Incentives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractData donations promise to unlock the social benefits of personal data. Recently, contact-tracing apps were developed to collect data from individuals to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Because the success of these apps depends on widespread adoption and continuous data collection, we evaluate the effectiveness of monetary incentive mechanisms at promoting verified installations of the German Corona-Warn-App and short- and long-term data donations. We find monetary incentives are effective in the short term: They significantly increase app installations and short-term data donations, tripling the number of data donors after 14 days compared to no compensation. However, the positive stimulus of monetary incentives vanishes in the long term: After eight months, installers in treatments with monetary incentives are significantly more likely to have stopped donating data than intrinsically motivated installers who did not receive monetary incentives, as a consequence of experienced opportunity costs and a lack of perceived benefits. Consequently, long-term data donation rates are not significantly higher in treatments with monetary incentives. This suggests one-time payments are ineffective at promoting long-term data donations, as the short-term crowding-in of less intrinsically motivated installers is difficult to sustain when passive app usage limits opportunities for habit formation and convincing users of contact-tracing benefits.</content>

    <title>To Split or to Merge? How Partitioning Affects Consumption and Engagement with Digital Content</title>
    <updated>2025-06-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study reveals how partitioning serialized e-books into many short episodes (small partitioning (SP)) or fewer but lengthier segments (large partitioning (LP)) shapes reading behavior and economic outcomes. Using actual consumption data, we find that SP fosters higher total word consumption but can reduce overall progression through a title. Conversely, LP boosts completion rates, encourages deeper engagement through annotations and reviews, and spurs subsequent purchases. These positive effects are stronger when a book is popular or high in quality. Our results challenge the conventional view that shorter episodes automatically increase user attention, highlighting the need for a tailored approach. Stakeholders can implement LP for well-regarded or lengthy titles to maximize reader satisfaction and stimulate both reviews and further sales. Smaller partitions, however, might be beneficial for shorter works under a pay-per-word scheme or for certain audience preferences. By aligning partitioning strategies with content characteristics, publishers and platform owners can maintain robust consumer engagement, manage possible drawbacks of segmentation, and support sustainable growth. This research provides clear, actionable insights for digital publishing professionals seeking to optimize user experiences and drive profitability. These findings also encourage further inquiry into how partitioning strategies interact with rapidly evolving consumer preferences and reading technologies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Short-form video platforms such as TikTok and Douyin are widely used but have sparked serious concerns about their impact on youth mental health, especially suicidal thoughts. This study introduces a novel knowledge-guided neural topic model that predicts a video’s potential to induce suicidal thoughts in viewers at the time of upload. Unlike existing models, our approach integrates medical knowledge on suicide risk factors with user-generated content to improve prediction accuracy and explainability. Tested on real-world data from two major platforms, the model not only outperforms current machine learning and deep learning benchmarks but also uncovers emerging content themes linked to suicidal thought risk. For practice, this tool can be directly integrated into platforms’ content moderation pipelines, identifying high-risk videos for follow-up human review before harm spreads. For policy, it offers a scalable and ethically informed method to mitigate digital risks to youth mental health, balancing user safety with content creator rights. This work offers a critical step forward in responsible AI and public mental health protection in the era of algorithm-driven media.</content>

    <title>Toward Sustainable Electricity Markets: Capacity-Based Pricing for Electric Vehicle Smart Charging</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As electric vehicles (EVs) become more widespread, cities face the growing challenge of managing charging demand without overloading the grid. This study presents a novel information systems (IS) solution that supports smart and sustainable EV integration. The authors develop a capacity-based pricing model that adjusts in real time based on charging rates and grid capacity. Unlike many existing approaches, it avoids “avalanche effects” where synchronized charging behavior creates new demand peaks. The presented solution is also computationally efficient, making it practical for real-world use. Evaluated through simulations based on realistic urban scenarios, the model reduces demand volatility, aligns EV charging with renewable energy availability, and maintains overall charging costs for users. This work offers policy makers and energy providers a concrete tool to balance environmental goals with energy system reliability. For urban mobility planners, it provides a scalable, adaptive method to support the transition to cleaner urban mobility.</content>

    <title>Family Demands Diversity, Team Work–Family Conflict, and Team Effort: A Moderated Mediation Model</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most research on family demands has been conducted at the individual level, showing that they can negatively influence employees' abilities to manage the work‐family interface. We challenge this existing paradigm by arguing that at the team level, family demands diversity (i.e., differences among members of the same team with respect to their family demands) can enable the entire team to better manage the work‐family interface. Drawing on the categorization‐elaboration model and social exchange theory, we found that family demands diversity was indirectly and positively related to team effort through team backup behavior and team work‐to‐family conflict, and these effects were stronger when team family identity was low and supervisor family support was high. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings and the practical implications for HR policies and practices.</content>

    <title>Silence Inside Systems: Roots and Generativity Consequences</title>
    <updated>2025-06-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Modern information technology (IT) systems evolve less through visible coordination and more through subtle behavioral patterns—most notably, silence: the relative absence of interaction internally. We conceptualize silence as a dynamic system-wide behavior distinct from architecture. This quietness is a powerful design trait. Our study of nearly 1,400 systems over 25 years shows that when modules “talk” less, developers focus more, accelerating evolutionary innovation. Silent systems produce cleaner, more maintainable code and are 600 times more likely to be extended by others. This matters now more than ever. As systems grow larger and more entangled, brittleness has become a pressing problem; small tweaks routinely trigger large failures. Brute-force solutions, like scaling compute power, are reaching physical and economic limits. Silence is an architectural antidote; by reducing internal dependencies, it lets teams adapt swiftly, avoid technical debt spirals, and better steward artificial intelligence-driven and autonomous systems. For practitioners and policymakers, this paper urges a rethink of how we build and sustain IT systems. Rather than endlessly scaling resources to support chatty, tightly linked modules, designers should prioritize structural quietness. Silence is not just good hygiene; it is a lever for IT resilience, scalability, and generative innovation. Silence is golden; it is what sharpens attention, anchors stability, and unlocks generative possibility.</content>
