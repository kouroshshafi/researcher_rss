    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms enter new sectors by either building on their resources or buying existing companies. Using French administrative data, we propose a measure of human capital distance between a firm and a sector of entry. Using a shift-share instrument, we show that firms build in close sectors and buy in distant sectors in terms of human capital distance. Firms build by hiring new workers, which becomes increasingly costly in distant sectors as it requires not only hiring more workers but also having more organizational capital to integrate these workers. Hence, firms buy in distant sectors to acquire already operational human capital. (JEL L25, J24, J30, G34)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A combinatorial market consists of a set of indivisible goods and a set of buyers, where each buyer has a valuation function that represents the buyer’s preferences over the subsets of items. In the dynamic pricing model, the buyers arrive in a sequential order, and each buyer selects a bundle of the remaining items that maximizes her utility. The buyers’ preferences are known in advance, and the seller is allowed to update the prices between the arrivals of buyers based upon the remaining set of items but without knowing the identity of the next buyer. We study the existence of optimal dynamic prices under fairness constraints in unit-demand markets and propose five possible notions of envy-freeness depending on the period over which agents compare themselves to others: the entire time horizon, only the past, only the future, a mixture of the two, or only the present.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online Allocation of Reusable Resources: New Algorithms and Analytical ToolsIn the paper “Asymptotically Optimal Competitive Ratio for Online Allocation of Reusable Resources,” the authors develop novel algorithms and analysis techniques for online allocation of reusable resources. Their approach leads to an algorithm with the highest possible competitive ratio, a result that was previously out of reach with the algorithms and techniques that are used in classic settings in which resources are nonreusable. More generally, their LP-free analysis approach is useful for analyzing the performance of online algorithms for various other settings in which the standard primal-dual approach fails.</content>

    <title>A Preregistered Falsification Test of the Decision by Sampling Model and Rank-Order Effect</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many social scientists have assumed that people’s preferences can be described by stable and coherent “utility” functions. This notion of stable utility functions has been challenged by cognitive psychologists who suggest that preferences are malleable and constructed in the moment, but neither camp has explained how the subjective valuations underpinning preferences arise. One influential attempt to do so is the Decision by Sampling (DbS) model, which suggests that a quantitative attribute’s (e.g., money sum’s) subjective value is its rank order in a momentarily activated memory sample. DbS thus implies that manipulating the recently experienced attribute distribution should change people’s subsequent valuations of that attribute: for example, from the typically assumed concave shape of the utility function to a convex shape. However, recent studies have pointed out methodological concerns in the evidence previously thought to support this prediction (and thus, DbS). In this preregistered study, we replicate the previous paradigm but address the methodological concerns to test if such a “rank-order” manipulation does change valuations. We derive qualitative predictions from DbS to verify that our conditions yield distinct predictions. We find strong evidence against the DbS’s prediction that a “rank-order” manipulation changes what options the participants select and how strongly they prefer the options. We also find extreme evidence in favor of a contextualization effect, implying that people value formally identical gambles differently depending on whether they cue a real-life setting or not. Although we encourage replication by independent laboratories, these results suggest that the DbS is falsified for this binary choice task.This paper was accepted by Yuval Rottenstreich, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This research was funded by the Marcus and Amalia Wallenberg Foundation [Grant MAW 2016.0132] and the Swedish Research School of Management and IT.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03611 .</content>

    <title>Sampling-Based Approximation for Series Inventory Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study inventory management of an infinite-horizon, series system with multiple stages. Each stage orders from its immediate upstream stage, and the most upstream stage orders from an external supplier. Random demand with unknown distribution occurs at the most downstream stage. Each stage incurs inventory holding cost while the most downstream stage also incurs demand backlogging cost when it experiences inventory shortage. The objective is to minimize the expected total discounted cost over the planning horizon. We apply the sample average approximation (SAA) method to obtain a heuristic policy (SAA policy) using the empirical distribution function constructed from a demand sample (of the underlying demand distribution). We derive an upper bound of sample size (viz., distribution-free bound) that guarantees that the performance of the SAA policy be close (i.e., with arbitrarily small relative error) to the optimal policy under known demand distribution with high probability. This result is obtained by first deriving a separable and tight cost upper bound of the whole system that depends on (given) echelon base-stock levels and then showing that the cost difference between the SAA and optimal policies can be measured by the distance between the empirical and the underlying demand distribution functions. We also provide a lower bound of sample size that matches the upper bound (in the order of relative error). Furthermore, when the demand distribution is continuous and has an increasing failure rate (IFR), we derive a tighter sample size upper bound (viz., distribution-dependent bound). Both distribution-free and distribution-dependent bounds for the newsvendor problem, a special case of our series system, improve the previous results. In addition, we show that both bounds increase polynomially as the number of stages increases. The performance of SAA policy and the sample size bounds are illustrated numerically. Finally, we extend the results to finite-horizon series systems.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Funding: K.

    <title>Crowdfunding Success for Female Versus Male Entrepreneurs Depends on Whether a Consumer Versus Investor Decision Frame Is Salient</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ensuring equal access to entrepreneurship and startup funding for both female and male entrepreneurs is crucial for societal perceptions of justice and long-term prosperity. Previous research presents contrasting findings, with some studies indicating a male advantage and others suggesting a female advantage. This research reconciles these inconsistencies by identifying the decision frame as a moderator. Specifically, in crowdfunding contexts, a consumer decision frame leads to stronger reliance on communal evaluation norms, resulting in favoring female entrepreneurs who are perceived as more disadvantaged. Conversely, an investor decision frame leads to stronger reliance on exchange evaluation norms, resulting in favoring male entrepreneurs who are perceived as more determined/passionate. Based on this, the authors propose that the strategic use of an entrepreneur's profile, activating a specific evaluation norm, and showing crowdfunding dependence attenuate the differential support for female versus male entrepreneurs, resulting in equal support for both. Results from six studies using a multimethod design provide converging support for this framework. This research is the first to differentiate between and directly compare consumer and investor decision frames, advancing the related literature and offering valuable guidelines for entrepreneurs, funding platforms, and public policy makers.</content>

    <title>Collective Layoffs and Offshoring: A Social Contract Account</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Collective layoffs can occur for many reasons, often related to a firm’s pursuit of greater efficiency and cost reduction, and they tend to trigger negative reactions among the public. Anecdotal evidence suggests that offshoring, one of the most controversial and politicized aspects of globalization, evokes particularly negative reactions. We propose a social contract account of consumer reactions to collective layoffs and demonstrate differential consumer responses to collective layoffs due to offshoring versus other reasons, such as automation. Layoffs due to offshoring are perceived as an especially egregious violation of the normative expectation that firms should support members of their society. Data from nine experimental studies (N = 5,568; seven reported in the main paper and two in the General Discussion), public consumer responses to layoffs in a large online community (N = 29,045), and layoff announcements in the European Union (N = 1,261) show that consumers react more negatively to collective layoffs due to offshoring compared to other reasons. Supporting our social contract account, the negative effect of offshoring is stronger when offshoring affects workers in the consumers’ home (vs. foreign) country, when the firm is domestic (vs. foreign), and when most customers are domestic (vs. foreign).</content>

    <title>When and Why Consumers (Erroneously) Believe Income Impacts the Enjoyment of Consumption Experiences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how people (as observers) anticipate levels of happiness from psychological consumption experiences (e.g., learning a new language or visiting a park). All else being equal, we propose and demonstrate that people expect differences in happiness based on income. Specifically, we show that relative to observers themselves, individuals simultaneously expect low-income consumers to enjoy psychological consumption experiences less and high-income consumers to enjoy them more. This is because consumers hold a lay theory that human needs must be fulfilled in a sequential, linear manner, which leads to income-based inferences of need prioritization. Thus, observers simultaneously believe that low-income consumers do (and should) prioritize their low-level physical needs first, but high-income consumers (who have presumably already fulfilled their physical needs) can prioritize their high-level psychological needs. Critically, we demonstrate that these lay theory-driven inferences are faulty, showing that the priority level assigned to these needs and the actual happiness resulting from psychological consumption experiences do not follow the predicted pattern. Namely, income either has no relationship with actual happiness (visitors to theme parks, sporting events, and concerts), or the reverse relationship, such that lower-income consumers report greater happiness than higher-income consumers (secondary data from a major league professional sports team).</content>

    <title>Informal networks and information environments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managers draw on their informal networks of peers outside of their firm to better understand uncertain markets and help their firms adapt. This helps firms enhance their performance in information environments characterized by idiosyncratic and difficult‐to‐standardize soft information. However, in information environments characterized by standardized hard information, joint discussions facilitated by informal networks can make managers and their firms maladaptive towards uncertain markets. Based on the performance of two different categories of hedge funds during the 2008 financial crisis, we find that long–short funds, which heavily draw on soft information, performed better when embedded into networks of closely connected managers. In contrast, relative value funds, which heavily draw on hard information, performed better when their managers were more disconnected.Managerial SummaryWhen are managers’ professional networks with peers in the industry valuable to the firm? We examined how hedge fund managers performed during the 2008 financial crisis to find out. When fund managers worked primarily with idiosyncratic and difficult‐to‐standardized soft information, we found that their networks helped them make sense of such information. In contrast, when fund managers worked primarily with quantified and codified hard information (e.g., financial statements and ratings), we found that their networks became echo chambers reinforcing similar opinions, which caused managers to fail to adapt quickly to the market crisis. Our findings counterintuitively suggest that funds using hard information may better off hiring relatively isolated managers who are not deeply tied to the industry.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Investor Learning in Crowdfunded Supply Chain Finance Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crowdfunded Supply Chain Finance (SCF) represents a novel market design that transforms financial flows within the SCF paradigm. It enables crowd investors to serve as financers, lending vital working capital to suppliers facing liquidity problems. A distinctive feature of this market is the mandatory involvement of loan guarantors, which facilitates repeated interactions between investors and fundraisers, potentially fostering investor learning. To understand how such learning dynamics shape investor decision-making, we develop a Bayesian learning model that conceptualizes investor perceptions of guarantor reliability as a subjective attitude underlying the perceived risk of a loan listing. The model posits that investors can learn about a guarantor’s reliability through a series of scheduled repayments involving the same guarantor over time.We consider investor decision-making a joint process comprising two interdependent components: (1) the incidence decision of whether to invest and (2) the amount decision of how much to invest. Our results reveal that investor perceptions of guarantor reliability play a crucial role in shaping both decisions, albeit in distinct ways. While perceived reliability exerts a positive, monotonic effect on amount decisions, its impact on incidence decisions follows an inverted U-shaped pattern. Furthermore, perceived reliability attenuates the positive effect of loan interest rates on both decisions, suggesting that the appeal of higher returns diminishes as investors’ reliability perceptions increase. A posterior analysis further shows that offering high interest rates may become counterproductive when perceived reliability is sufficiently high. These findings provide actionable implications for platform designers and participants in crowdfunded SCF markets.</content>

    <title>The Direct Effect of Managerial Responses: When Politeness Backfires</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managerial responses, which represent firms’ public replies to online reviews, are commonly employed in customer communications. Using a dataset collected from a leading mobile game app platform in China, this research examines the effect of managerial responses on the review updates of customers who receive them, that is, the direct effect of managerial responses. Platform users can update their reviews, and complete records of review updates are observable, which allows us to utilize variations in the same customer’s review ratings of a single game both before and after receiving a managerial response. Addressing concerns regarding the endogeneity of managerial responses, improvements in game quality, and censored data in rating updates, we find that users who update their reviews after receiving managerial responses upgrade their ratings by an average of one star. In addition, we find that the positive direct effect of managerial responses is negatively moderated by the level of response politeness, measured separately using both machine learning and large language models. By conducting a survey study, we further show that as the level of politeness increases, the likelihood of reviewers perceiving a managerial response as an attempt to persuade them also increases. These findings highlight the positive direct effect of managerial response and the importance of response style, specifically politeness, which can produce a backfire effect in online communications.</content>

    <title>Tapping into User Effort? Improving Referral Outcomes in Crowdfunding Markets</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Referral programs have received increasing attention as a way to enhance project fundraising in crowdfunding. To improve operational efficiency and performance, many crowdfunding platforms allow users to exert more effort (referral effort) when making referrals. In this paper, we study the impact of users’ referral efforts on referral outcomes, using a unique data set from a reward-based crowdfunding platform. We analyze three types of referral effort beyond merely sharing the referral link, namely, writing the referral message, matching the referral recipients’ pledges, and supporting their own referrals. Our results suggest that users’ referral efforts can help improve the outcome of referrals, as these efforts may be perceived as positive signals of quality, thus reducing referral recipients’ uncertainty about the crowdfunding project. We further explore the heterogeneity in this observed impact, and find that matching recipients’ pledges have a greater impact than the other two types of referral effort. Furthermore, the impact of referral effort is attenuated under conditions of low uncertainty, wherein project quality can be inferred from observable features, such as projects launched by large creators, selected by editors, or referred by experienced backers. Our analyses also indicate that referring users’ efforts can collectively improve the fundraising performance of projects that receive referrals. We discuss the implications of our findings for platform managers, policy makers, and users in crowdfunding marketplaces.</content>

    <title>Coverage-Validity-Aware Algorithmic Recourse</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In “Coverage-Validity-Aware Algorithmic Recourse,” Bui, Nguyen, Yue, and Nguyen introduce a novel framework to enhance the explainability and robustness of algorithmic recourse in machine learning models. Algorithmic recourse provides actionable steps for individuals to achieve favorable outcomes from predictive models, addressing ethical and transparency challenges. However, existing methods often fail to account for the evolving nature of predictive models, rendering current recourses invalid as models update with new data. To address this, the authors propose a novel model-agnostic framework designed to generate recourses robust to future model shifts. The framework constructs a coverage-validity-aware linear surrogate of the nonlinear (black box) model for recourse generation, enabling recourses that remain valid across model updates. The approach leverages theoretical insights from minimax probability machines, demonstrating how varying covariance robustness recovers widely used regularizations, such as ℓ2regularization and class reweighting. This method holds promise for applications in credit scoring, hiring algorithms, and other domains where fairness, transparency, and adaptability are critical to maintaining trust and accountability in artificial intelligence systems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Divide and Conquer: Solving the Euclidean Diversity Problem Through Coordinate PartitioningA common technique for solving difficult optimization problems is to break them into easier-to-manage pieces, yet it is rarely obvious how to do so. This is especially true for the Euclidean max-sum diversity problem, which becomes increasingly difficult as the number of coordinates grows despite the problem size remaining the same. In “Coordinate Partitioning for Difficult Euclidean Max-Sum Diversity Problems,” Spiers, Bui, and Loxton use an old result by Schoenberg to transform Euclidean distances into their squared counterparts, enabling a functional decomposition of the problem’s objective. The authors introduce novel partitioning strategies as well as a globally convergent cutting-plane algorithm, which can effectively solve high-dimension instances. They also present a new class of challenging instances characterized by locations on the surface of a hyperball.</content>

    <title>Groceries or School Cafeterias:  How Households Respond to School  Nutrition Mandates</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) placed strict nutritional mandates on meals served at U.S. public schools. This policy offers a unique opportunity to study household response to a large, exogenous change in healthiness of food available to their children. Did more healthy school meals lead households to substitute toward them, and away from grocery food purchases? Which households were more responsive to the nutritional mandates? And was there any spillover effect on the nutritional quality of their grocery food purchases? The authors document a meaningful decrease in the quantity of grocery food in response to the HHFKA, and a small decrease in quality. Consistent with substitution toward school meals, more of the quantity decrease is attributable to items likely to be purchased for children and categories traditionally associated with breakfast and lunch (the meals served at school). The HHFKA attracted even greater participation from financially constrained and time-constrained households for whom school meals were already important and were now coupled with the additional benefit of healthier food. These findings have important implications for policy makers and researchers, but also for food manufacturers and retailers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conducted a qualitative, real‐life study where we tracked the introduction, implementation, and use of a new AI technology in a company. We identified four distinct trust configurations among organizational members: full trust (high cognitive/high emotional), full distrust (low cognitive/low emotional), uncomfortable trust (high cognitive/low emotional), and blind trust (low cognitive/high emotional). Furthermore, we found that organizational members exhibited distinct behaviours under the four trust configurations: Some responded by detailing their digital footprints, while others engaged in manipulating, confining, or withdrawing them. These behaviours triggered a ‘vicious cycle’, where biased (due to manipulation) and unbalanced and asymmetric (due to detailing, confining, or withdrawing) data inputs degraded AI performance, further eroding trust and stalling adoption. Our primary contribution is a model that explains how organizational members behave under different trust configurations and how these behaviours affect AI performance and, ultimately, AI adoption in organizations. We also provide valuable insights for managers.</content>

    <title>The “WEIRDEST” Organizations in the World? Assessing the Lack of Sample Diversity in Organizational Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sampling data from organizations and humans associated with those organizations is essential to organizational research. Much of what we know about organizations is based on such work. However, this empirical foundation may be compromised, calling into question the field’s theoretical and empirical findings. Studies often sample data from relatively similar, narrow contexts, so a lack of sample diversity accumulates in the discipline. To conceptualize this lack of sample diversity and examine its prevalence across research publications, we conduct a pre-registered systematic review of articles from 2018 to 2022 in six top management journals and another systematic review of articles from 2013 to 2022 in six additional journals (not pre-registered). Our review assesses sample country diversity while also exploring within-country factors that are relatively under or oversampled, such as the size or industry of the sampled organization. We find a lack of sample diversity, for instance, a strong bias toward WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) samples and an underrepresentation of small and medium-sized enterprises in organizational research. Based on the findings and past work, we introduce a conceptual framework for sample diversity along three dimensions: the sample’s geographical, organizational, and personnel contexts. Additionally, we discuss factors that contribute to a lack of sample diversity and propose guidelines for authors, reviewers, and editors to enhance it. Overall, this article seeks to improve the robustness and relevance of theoretical and empirical organizational research, thereby preventing the formulation of misinformed policies and practices in both organizational settings and broader societal contexts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Portfolio allocation decisions increasingly incorporate social values. We develop a tractable framework to study how competition between investors to own socially valuable assets affects social welfare. Relative to the most common social‐investing strategies, we identify alternative strategies that result in higher impact and higher financial returns. We identify strategies for investors to have impact when impact is difficult to measure. From the firm's perspective, increasing profitability can have greater impact than directly increasing social value. We present new empirical evidence on the social preferences of investors that demonstrates the practical relevance of our theory.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Long-term orientation has been proposed as one of the differences between family and nonfamily firms. Family business scholars base this difference theoretically on the incumbent generation’s altruism for the next generation and the intention for intrafamily succession. We point out that the applicable boundaries for these two theoretical bases are limited. We also point out misconceptions regarding what these two theoretical bases imply about the long-term oriented behavior of family businesses and discuss implications for empirical research and theory development.</content>

    <title>Community-Engaged School District Design: A Stream-Based Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;School district design decisions are a crucial part of public education systems, and operations research has played an important role in informing such decisions since the landmark United States Supreme Court decision on school desegregation in 1954. Design processes today place significant importance on comprehensive community engagement to create equitable and effective enrollment policies reflective of community needs and values. In “Community-Engaged School District Design: A Stream-Based Approach,” Ozel, Smilowitz, and Goldstein revisit the school district design problem with a focus on codesigning with community partners. The authors introduce a new compact formulation that makes multiple interrelated assignment decisions simultaneously with composite decision variables, called “streams.” This formulation is computationally efficient and easily reconfigurable for evolving problem specifications that are endemic to community codesign. These features were essential in the district redesign process in an Illinois public school district, described in the paper, allowing the community to iteratively develop proposals to address inequities in access to education and improve the student assignment process.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Machine data (MD), that is, data generated by machines, are increasingly gaining importance, potentially surpassing the value of the extensively discussed personal data. We present a theoretical analysis of the MD market, addressing challenges such as data fragmentation, ambiguous property rights, and the public-good nature of MD. We consider machine users producing data and data aggregators providing MD analytics services (e.g., with digital twins for real-time simulation and optimization). By analyzing machine learning algorithms, we identify critical properties for the value of MD analytics, Scale, Scope, and Synergy. We leverage these properties to explore market scenarios, including anonymous and secret contracting, competition among MD producers, and multiple competing aggregators. We identify significant inefficiencies and market failures, highlighting the need for nuanced policy interventions.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00674 .</content>

    <title>The Impact of Air Pollution on Consumer Spending</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Air pollution is a growing threat to economies and societies. Despite the common knowledge that air pollution impairs emotions and cognition and, hence, behavioral outcomes, the impact of air pollution on consumer spending remains an open question. Analyzing air quality readings and individual-level credit card transactions in South Korea, this article shows that consumers spend more money when air quality is poorer. This correlation is more prominent in hedonic categories, such as entertainment or leisure activities, where the nature of consumption is characterized by greater emotional benefits. The authors consider potential explanations, and the leading hypothesis is that consumers treat spending as a mood-regulating resource. The results survive an array of robustness checks and are supported in a controlled experiment, reinforcing a causal inference behind the main findings. The authors provide implications for stakeholders to develop a sustainable marketing program that not only pursues managerial interests but also concerns consumer welfare in the face of environmental change.</content>

    <title>Lost Time in Crowdsourcing Contests</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crowdsourcing contests are a popular way to seek innovative business solutions, but the availability of multiple contests can cause “lost time,” the delay between a contest’s start and a solver’s first visit. This study examines how lost time affects solvers’ submission behavior and its impact on matching inefficacy, measured by solver disqualification, which occurs when a solver fails to meet the seeker’s baseline submission criteria. Using mediation analysis, we show that lost time can increase matching inefficacy because solvers spend less time on their initial submissions and submit fewer solutions. Interestingly, we identify latecomer disadvantage as an important mechanism driving solvers’ behavioral responses to lost time, suggesting that simply increasing contest duration does not eliminate the issue. Instead, modifying submission behaviors through incentive structures—such as early bird bonuses—and continuous feedback may help alleviate the negative effects of lost time. Additionally, offering grace periods to late entrants can counterbalance the disadvantage of joining later. These strategies, informed by our findings, can enhance solver engagement and improve the effectiveness of crowdsourcing platforms in achieving desirable outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the optimal financing of infrastructure when governments can expropriate rents from private sector firms that manage infrastructure. While private firms need incentives to implement projects well, governments need incentives to limit expropriation. This double moral hazard limits the willingness of outside investors to fund infrastructure projects. Optimal financing contracts involve government guarantees to investors against project failure to incentivize the government to agree not to expropriate, thus improving private sector incentives and project quality. The contract also reflects several other features prevalent in infrastructure financing in practice, among which are government coinvestment, tax subsidies, and development rights.

    <title>How do corporate tax hikes affect investment allocation within multinationals?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how corporate tax hikes transmit across countries through multinationals’ internal networks of subsidiaries. We build a parsimonious multicountry model to highlight two opposing spillover effects: while tax competition between countries generates positive investment spillover, intra-firm production linkages predict negative spillover. Using subsidiary-level data and exogenous corporate tax hikes, we find that local business units cut investment by 0.5% for a 1% increase in foreign corporate tax. This result highlights the importance of production linkages in propagating foreign tax shocks, as the supply-chain-induced negative spillover dominates the positive spillover effect suggested by the conventional wisdom of tax competition.</content>

    <title>Officer-Involved: The Media Language of Police Killings</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines language patterns in US television news coverage of police killings. We first document that the media use semantic structures—such as passive voice, nominalizations, and intransitive verbs—that obscure responsibility more often in cases of police killings than in cases of civilian killings. Through an online experiment, we demonstrate the significance of these semantic differences, revealing that participants are less likely to hold police officers morally responsible and demand penalties when exposed to obfuscatory language, particularly in cases involving unarmed victims. Further analysis of news data shows greater use of obfuscatory language when the victims are unarmed or video footage is available—situations where obfuscation may have the greatest impact. Exploring the causes of this differential obfuscation, we do not find evidence that it is driven by either demand-side factors or supply-side factors associated with TV station ownership and political leaning. Instead, our results suggest that narratives crafted by police departments are a more likely driver of media obfuscation. Our study underscores the importance of semantic structures in how media shape perceptions, extending beyond considerations of coverage volume and bias.</content>

    <title>The Impact of Being Denied a Wanted Abortion on Women and Their Children</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of denying a wanted abortion on women and children in Colombia using high-quality administrative microdata and credibly exogenous variation in abortion access. Women can seek legal abortions through a tutela, with cases randomly assigned to judges. Female judges are 20 p.p. (32%) less likely to deny abortion cases than male judges, and we use the judge’s sex as an instrument for abortion denial. Denial of a wanted abortion has both immediate and lasting effects. It increases a woman’s risk of death by 2.5 p.p within nine months, mainly due to unsafe abortion procedures, and raises the likelihood of carrying the pregnancy to term by 31 p.p. Tracking outcomes up to 15 years later, we find that women denied an abortion experience more health issues, lower educational attainment, reduced labor-force participation, and higher rates of single motherhood, poverty, and reliance on government assistance. Existing children, born before their mother sought an abortion, are less likely to attend school and more likely to work.</content>

    <title>Who Is AI Replacing? The Impact of Generative AI on Online Freelancing Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on the demand for online freelancers using a large data set from a leading global freelancing platform. We identify the types of jobs that are more affected by generative AI and quantify the magnitude of the heterogeneous impact. Our findings indicate a 21% decrease in the number of job posts for automation-prone jobs related to writing and coding compared with jobs requiring manual-intensive skills within eight months after the introduction of ChatGPT. We show that the reduction in the number of job posts increases competition among freelancers, whereas the remaining automation-prone jobs are of greater complexity and offer higher pay. We also find that the introduction of image-generating AI technologies led to a 17% decrease in the number of job posts related to image creation. We use Google Trends to show that the more pronounced decline in the demand for freelancers within automation-prone jobs correlates with their higher public awareness of ChatGPT’s substitutability.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05420 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Teams are formed because input from different people is needed. Providing incentives to team members, however, can be difficult. According to received wisdom, declaring all members responsible fails because real responsibility for team output “diffuses.” But why? Also, why and when does formally declaring one member “responsible” mean that this member can be attributed real responsibility? We offer a model that answers these questions. We identify when jointly declaring a team responsible results in reputation free riding. We show that declaring one person responsible can overcome this problem but only if all other team members are protected from being sanctioned.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.</content>

    <title>The Race for Data: Utilizing Informative or Persuasive Cues to Gain Opt-In?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandates explicit user opt-in consent for data access. It recommends transparency in opt-in requests about data collection, storage, and use, without specifying the format of these requests. Consequently, the GDPR gives firms flexibility in designing opt-in messages. This research uses theory, multiple datasets, and methods to investigate firms’ communication formats for opt-in requests, addressing three questions: (1) How do firms design their opt-in requests? (2) Does the chosen format affect consumer response? (3) What drives firms’ choices of formats? The analysis of 1,506 repermission emails from 1,396 firms post-GDPR shows that 26% use only persuasive cues to request data, while 24% blend persuasive and informative cues. Notably, businesses with an offline presence use more persuasive cues compared with purely digital entities. A field experiment rationalizes this behavior showing that informative cues alone did not improve opt-in; a mix of persuasive and informative cues proved more successful. Additionally, firms dependent on personal data use persuasive cues more often than firms concerned with reputational risks of GDPR noncompliance. This study offers pivotal insights for regulators, firms, and consumers, revealing variations in how different firms acquire consent and the impact of their strategies on user behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice‐driven institutionalism (PDI) is a conceptual lens that explains how practices connect macro‐level phenomena with micro‐level behaviours. Effective practices matter in hybrid organisational settings, such as cross‐sector partnerships, where actors from diverse institutional backgrounds collaborate. Despite its potential, PDI has yet to fully explore the dynamics and interactions among practices, which are essential for understanding their collective and temporal impact in any hybrid setting. Our study addresses this gap through a qualitative multi‐case analysis of three cross‐sector partnerships tackling complex social and environmental challenges. We identify three interconnected sets of partnership practices that help actors navigate the complexities that occur when the logics of business, government, and civil society clash. We reveal a cyclical pattern where collaboration oscillates between motivation and fatigue, driven by these practices. We introduce a conceptual model that transcends the so far static and isolated view on practices, advancing the PDI lens beyond its current limitations. Furthermore, it illuminates the role of the individual in hybrid settings of collaboration.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This essay revisits my 2014 JIBS article about the potential for integrating international business internalization theory with a strategic management capabilities perspective. It recaps the capabilities framework with an emphasis on the learning required of emerging market multinationals and illustrates this with the case of Hyundai Motor Company’s internationalization and growth. It also discusses two aspects of the global economy that have become more prominent since 2014 in shaping international business: geopolitical uncertainty and digitalization. A rise in geopolitical tensions appears to be rebalancing the relationships between multinationals and home/host governments. Digitalization facilitates international business; but it adds new vulnerabilities by (further) accelerating competition, enabling new rivals, and introducing systemic risks into digital supply chains. Implications for managers, board members, and international business scholars are drawn.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the optimal design of stress scenarios. A principal manages the unknown risk exposures of agents by asking them to report losses under hypothetical scenarios before taking remedial actions. We apply a Kalman filter to solve the learning problem, and we relate the optimal design to the risk environment, the principal's preferences, and available interventions. In a banking context, optimal capital requirements cover losses under an adverse scenario, while targeted interventions depend on covariances among residual exposures and systematic risks. Our calibration reveals that information is particularly valuable for targeted interventions as opposed to broad capital requirements.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite its importance to the functioning of entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs), the orchestration of networks remains a largely undertheorized topic. To address this “omission,” we sought to explain the interplay between networks, their orchestrators, and their implications for ecosystem outcomes. To do so, we conducted an in-depth case study of the Agtech Valley EE in Brazil. From our study, we developed theoretical insights on the notion of “ecosystem coherence” as a foundational driver of EE structuration. Findings revealed two dimensions of ecosystem coherence: capabilities coherence (based on organizational and cognitive proximities) and relationship coherence (based on institutional and social proximities).</content>

    <title>The Fed and the Secular Decline in Interest Rates</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper documents a striking fact: a narrow window around Fed meetings captures the entire secular decline in U.S. Treasury yields. Yield movements outside this window are transitory and wash out over time. This is surprising because the forces behind the secular decline are thought to be independent of monetary policy. Long-term bond yields decline when the Fed cuts the short rate and when the Fed lowers its long-run forecast of the federal funds rate (the “dot plot”). These results are consistent with the view that Fed announcements provide guidance about the long-run path of interest rates. (JEL E43, E52, G12, G14)</content>

    <title>To Ask or Not to Ask: The Effects of Broadly and Narrowly Adopted Peer-Recognition Systems on Help Seeking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many companies now use peer-recognition systems that allow employees to publicly recognize their peers for positive behaviors. Practitioners have touted the potential for these systems to increase helping among employees. However, the extent to which employees actually use these systems to recognize their peers varies across organizations; some are used broadly by many employees across all functional, specialty, geographic, and hierarchical subgroups of the organization, whereas others are only narrowly used by some, but not all, subgroups. Across three experiments, we examine how peer-recognition systems impact employees’ propensity to ask others for help (i.e., help seeking) based on whether the system is broadly used by all subgroups or only narrowly used by specific subgroups. We predict and find that a peer-recognition system broadly used by all subgroups strengthens employees’ perception of a help-seeking norm. This perception increases employees’ propensity to seek help directly through norm conformity and indirectly by reducing the perceived psychological costs of help seeking. We also predict and find that the effect of peer-recognition systems that are narrowly used by specific subgroups is moderated by whether employees belong to the subgroups using the system; whereas it increases help-seeking propensity for members of the subgroups using the system, it decreases help-seeking propensity for nonmembers relative to when there is no peer-recognition system. Our theory and results suggest that peer-recognition systems can increase help seeking, but these same systems could decrease help seeking for employees belonging to subgroups that do not use the system.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: Supported by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Indiana University.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00318 .</content>

    <title>The Value of Specific Knowledge: Evidence from Disruptions to the Patient–Physician Relationship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When a member of a work team leaves, some knowledge is lost to the organization. Exploiting quasi-random turnover among military physicians because of deployments, I estimate the effects of turnover on patients and other providers in the same care team. I find that a discontinuity in primary care leads to a 3%–5% increase in costs driven primarily by an increase in the use and intensity of specialty care with no observable benefit to the patient as measured by potential reductions in hospitalization rates and emergency department usage. This indicates that the full cost of turnover includes a reduction in access to knowledge among remaining members of the team.This paper was accepted by Carri Chan, healthcare management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03884 .</content>

    <title>Play it Again, Sam? Reference-Point Formation and Product Differentiation in the Music Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Newly released music is never assessed in isolation by audiences, who tend to compare objective (sonic attributes) and subjective (genre affiliations) elements of its identity with the previous musical catalog of the corresponding artist, his or her musically proximal peers, and the most successful releases in the market. In this paper, we provide a general framework that disentangles the objective and subjective identities of new musical releases and evaluates how differentiation affects audience reactions. We posit that radio stations, who seek commercial success, have different preferences toward differentiation in comparison with critics, who grant cultural legitimacy in the industry. Combining play numbers, reviews, and music description data from different sources, we find that radio stations prefer consistency in the musical style of successive releases by the focal artist and especially favor albums that sound similar to chart toppers. Critics, however, exhibit opposite preferences, preferring novelty compared with past works of the artist, while remaining uninfluenced by contemporaneous music dynamics. Our moderation checks reveal that decisions around genre affiliations and scheduling of new releases aid music producers to effectively manage audience expectations. This suggests that data-driven decision support systems can help artists to strategically release new products that cater to heterogeneous tastes.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, entrepreneurship and innovation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03319 .</content>

    <title>The Political Economy of Tariff Exemption Grants</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate whether firm-level political connections affect the allocation of exemptions from tariffs imposed on $US 550 billion of Chinese goods imported to the United States annually beginning in 2018. Evidence points to politicians not only rewarding supporters but also punishing opponents: Past campaign contributions to the party controlling (in opposition to) the executive branch increase (decrease) approval likelihood. Our findings point to quid pro quo arrangements between politicians and firms, as opposed to the “information” channel linking political access to regulatory outcomes.</content>
