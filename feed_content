    <title>Lives Versus Livelihoods: The Impact of the Great Recession on Mortality and Welfare</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage spatial variation in the severity of the Great Recession across the United States to examine its impact on mortality and explore the quantitative implications. We estimate that an increase in the unemployment rate of the magnitude of the Great Recession reduces the average annual age-adjusted mortality rate by 2.3%, with effects persisting for at least 10 years. Mortality reductions appear across causes of death and are concentrated in the half of the population with a high school degree or less. We estimate similar percentage reductions in mortality at all ages, with declines in elderly mortality thus responsible for about three-quarters of the total mortality reduction. Recession-induced mortality declines are driven primarily by external effects of reduced aggregate economic activity on mortality, and reduced air pollution appears to be a quantitatively important mechanism. Incorporating our estimates of procyclical mortality into a standard macroeconomic framework substantially reduces the welfare costs of recessions, particularly for people with less education, and at older ages.</content>

    <title>“Why I Searched Alone”: Understanding Mothers’ Hesitation to Seek Network Assistance During Workforce Reentry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although prevalent network theories posit that job seekers are motivated to utilize networks for instrumental benefits, we argue that sociopsychological barriers can discourage network use even when access is readily available. We examine this overlooked dynamic by exploring how sociopsychological factors influence network activation among mothers reentering the workforce after child-related career breaks. Analyzing panel data from a representative sample of Korean job seekers, we find that these mothers are markedly less inclined to use network-based search methods than other groups of women. This inclination remains when we account for individual fixed effects, employment gap length, and potential network disturbances. To uncover the reasons behind this distinct job-search behavior, we conducted in-depth interviews with 60 mothers who experienced child-related employment breaks and 38 other individuals, including mothers without such breaks, nonmothers, and fathers. Whereas existing theories attribute limited network use to restricted access, our qualitative evidence reveals deeper sociopsychological hurdles: mothers often anticipate challenges in reciprocating job-related assistance and the potential revelation of their inferior status when seeking help. These multifaceted internal conflicts not only hamper mothers’ swift reintegration into the labor force but also nudge them toward roles for which they are overqualified. As we bridge these findings, we identify novel theoretical avenues for future research, underscoring how sociopsychological hurdles to network activation can produce gender inequalities in the labor market.Funding: Support from the Wharton Dean’s Research Fund and Wharton’s Center for Human Resources.</content>

    <title>Technical Note: What’s in a Constraint? On the Ambiguity of Standard Delay Targets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ambiguities in Average Speed of Answer TargetsStaffing problems are often formulated as satisfization problems, in which the cost of servers is minimized subject to quality of service constraints. These constraints are intended to capture customers’ disutility from waiting or, at least, its structure. In “What’s in a constraint? On the ambiguity of standard delay targets,” Soh and Gurvich show that such targets—especially the popular average speed of answer—are ambiguous: they give rise to multiple optimal solutions (prioritization policies), each consistent with different assumptions about how customers value their time. By choosing, among all optimal solutions, the one that minimizes a weighted index of diversion (a generalization of variance for the multiclass queue), a service provider can ensure that its ASA-based staffing and prioritization decisions align with a convex model of customer delay disutility. Nonambiguity can also be enforced by restricting attention to fixed queue ratio priority policies.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Uncertainty About Future Accounting Standards on Financial Reporting Quality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Financial statement preparers frequently trade off the benefit of reporting biased estimates with potential penalties for misreporting. In making this trade-off, preparers often face uncertainty about potential changes to accounting standards (“standard-setting uncertainty”) that could affect the future benefits of biased reporting. Our experiment documents two novel behavioral effects of standard-setting uncertainty on preparers’ estimates. First, standard-setting uncertainty causes preparers to make less biased estimates, even though reduced bias conflicts with their financial incentives in our setting. Second, standard-setting uncertainty increases preparers’ sensitivity to measurement imprecision, which is important for high-quality financial reporting. Although standard-setting uncertainty is often criticized, our theory and results suggest that increased financial reporting quality can be an unanticipated benefit of the uncertainty that naturally arises from a measured and deliberative standard-setting process.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: Research funding was provided by The University of Arizona, The University of Texas at Austin, and Cornell University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01469 .</content>

    <title>The Performance Effects of Giving Front-Line Employees Direct Access to Performance Data and Thereby Limiting the Supervisor’s Feedback-Intermediation Role: Evidence from a Field Experiment</title>
    <updated>2025-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Ethan Bernstein, Shelley Xin Li</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how giving front-line employees direct access to their performance data affects performance. To explore that impact, we conducted a field experiment at a service organization that made employees’ daily time-use analytics—previously available only to supervisors—simultaneously available to the employees themselves. We find, compared with the preintervention mean value, a significant treatment effect (an 11% decrease) in nonproductive time relative to the control group. That time, however, flows not strictly to productive (revenue-generating) activities but largely to the most convenient outlets, suggesting—as supported by our qualitative evidence—that data transparency on average shifted behavior more toward avoiding nonproductive activities than toward approaching productive activities. (As one participant observed, it led people to “conform, not excel.”) We examine three relational factors we believed, based on prior feedback research, could moderate the performance effect: perceived supervisor support, social comparison orientation, and work motivation type. Performance improvements are greater for employees who perceived their supervisors as less supportive and for those with low intrinsic motivation or high extrinsic motivation; we fail to find a moderating effect of social comparison orientation. Therefore, although we identify the avoidance (although not approach) value of transparent performance data, our results also tell a nuanced story about the supervisor’s optimal role in delivering feedback: The ability to shift people away from “bad” and toward other uses of time depends on the employee’s perception of supervisor quality and the employee’s motivation type.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, organizations.Funding: We are grateful to the Division of Research and Faculty Development at the Harvard Business School and the USC Marshall School of Business for funding this research.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02395 .</content>

    <title>Ideation with Generative AI—in Consumer Research and Beyond</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The use of generative AI (genAI) in consumer research is rapidly evolving, with applications including synthetic data generation, data analysis, and more. However, their role in creative ideation—a cornerstone of consumer research—remains underexplored. Drawing on the human creativity literature, we propose that ideation with genAI is facilitated by its productivity and semantic breadth, which are psychologically analogous to the dual pathways of persistence and flexibility in human ideation. Further, we distinguish between the utility of genAI as a key ideator versus humans as key ideator, conceptualized through the genAI ideation roles of Designer and Writer and of Interviewer and Actor. While genAI excels in generating incremental improvements, its potential for groundbreaking innovation could be unlocked by leveraging its ability to prompt human creativity. This article advances the theoretical and practical understanding of genAI in ideation for consumer research, offering numerous practical guidelines for integrating generative AI into research while emphasizing human–AI collaboration to achieve radical insights.</content>

    <title>The GenAI Future of Consumer Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a novel generative AI (GenAI) trajectory, “democratization-average trap-model collapse,” to identify data and model challenges posed by GenAI, from which we project the GenAI future of consumer research. This trajectory consists of three key phenomena: democratization broadens consumer participation, the average trap produces generic responses, and model collapse occurs when GenAI outputs lose human sensibilities. Data and model challenges arise as democratization enhances data representation while also embedding real-world biases. The average trap, caused by next-token prediction models, leads to generic outputs that lack individuality. Additionally, model collapse occurs when GenAI increasingly learns from its own outputs, amplifying machine bias and diverging from human behavior. To address these challenges, researchers can leverage democratization to study marginalized consumers and prioritize human-centered research over purely data-driven methods. The average trap can be mitigated by fine-tuning models with task-specific and marginalized consumption data while engineering responses for uniqueness. Preventing model collapse requires integrating human–machine hybrid data and applying theories of mind to realign AI with human-centric consumption. Finally, we outline three future research directions: preserving data distribution tails to support consumption democratization, countering the average trap in next-token prediction, and reversing the trajectory from democratization to model collapse.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Explorations of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) have moved to the forefront of consumer research, as scholars examine its implications for ideation and conceptualization, data collection and analysis, and writing and publishing. Introducing this special section of the Journal of Consumer Research on GenAI and consumer research, the author calls for a critical—and self-critical—engagement with GenAI, calling on researchers to embrace its potential while remaining mindful of both its constraints and their own biases. The author concludes that, given GenAI’s rapid evolution, the insights in this special section remain provisional and may require reconsideration as the technology advances.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has introduced new possibilities for both the creation and analysis of language, which is one key input for consumer culture researchers who analyze qualitative and textual data. How can consumer culture researchers use GenAI to produce insights and work with qualitative data? What are the possibilities and challenges of using these tools? And what are some valuable practices and principles for integrating GenAI into the research process? Building from interviews with researchers who use these tools, the authors identify relevant theoretical, embodied, empirical, and historical contextual dimensions that produce opportunities and challenges for human–AI collaboration. The authors then propose a set of collaborative practices and offer practical guidelines for using GenAI to generate novel and meaningful insights into consumer culture and society.</content>

    <title>When to Broadcast? Inventory Disclosure Policies for Online Sales of Limited Inventory</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online sales of limited inventory such as flash sales and lightning deals have become popular among e-commerce retailers including Amazon and eBay. This study focuses on the retailer’s best timing of disclosing inventory information to maximize the expected sales in a finite horizon. We consider how two prominent customer mechanisms, herding effect and scarcity effect, affect the relative performance of different policies. We analyze the following common policies in practice: “always disclose,” “never disclose,” and the fixed threshold policy, which broadcasts the inventory level once it drops below a predetermined level. We also propose a novel time-dependent threshold policy, which we prove to be the optimal policy under reasonable assumptions. We devise efficient algorithms to optimize the policy parameters, and we compare all policies through a numerical study. We find that both threshold policies significantly outperform the two simple policies. Moreover, herding effect and scarcity effect have significant impacts on the relative performance of different policies. Our study provides not only effective and efficient algorithms for policy optimization but also guidelines for policy selection. Policymakers can refer to our study to identify the most appropriate policy, depending on the relative strength of the two customer mechanisms on the platform.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digital platforms have revolutionized business sectors; however, despite their significant success, platform unicorns remain rare. While extensive research exists on digital platform growth, it is uncertain what entrepreneurial decisions achieve unicorn status. We address the research question of what combination of complementary entrepreneurial decisions increases and decreases the likelihood of becoming a platform unicorn. The study examines 125 digital mental health platform ventures, including 12 unicorns, using the Dealroom database and decision tree methodology. We provide combinations of complementary decisions concerning fundraising timing, funding sources, digital technologies, and business model choices that affect a platform venture's probability of becoming a unicorn. The study offers decision profiles for navigating the uncertainties of the digital age. We discuss implications for strategic entrepreneurship and a judgment‐based approach.Managerial SummaryIn the digital age, achieving unicorn status depends on the right combination of complementary decisions about fundraising timing, funding sources, digital technology, and business model choices. Entrepreneurs dealing with uncertainty frequently rely on their intuition to make such decisions. Our research complements intuition with evidence that can now be obtained by deploying artificial intelligence tools like decision trees and highlights complementary decision profiles that have a higher likelihood of becoming unicorns, such as profiles with early‐stage funding, no government funding, and deep tech serving the B2B market. Conversely, we identify combinations with less than 1% success rates, indicating failed judgments. Research insights can help entrepreneurs and investors make better‐informed decisions to enhance mental health platform venture success and be aware of possible failure.</content>

    <title>Expectations and Exits: The Effect of CEO Agency and Communion on Boards’ Expectancy Violations and Dismissal of CEOs Following Breaches of Stakeholder Rights</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How well CEOs manage and protect their stakeholders’ interests has risen as an important criterion in boards’ evaluation of CEOs. Research supports this notion by showing that CEOs who underinvest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) often face bleak job prospects. Therefore, when firms are involved in regulatory sanctions concerning stakeholders’ interests, CEOs may face the risk of dismissal, albeit to different degrees because boards may interpret such events in light of their expectations of CEOs’ stakeholder orientation. We suggest that these expectations are in part formed by boards’ perception of CEOs’ agency and communion—fundamental and distinct motives that signal CEOs’ differential commitment to personal competence, independence, control, and managing relationships with stakeholders. Building upon expectancy violations theory, we argue that following stakeholder-related regulatory sanctions, a CEO faces a higher likelihood of dismissal when perceived by the board as more communal or less agentic but a lower likelihood of dismissal when perceived as more agentic or less communal. We also posit that such tendencies hinge on firms’ CSR efforts and media sentiment, which further affect boards’ expectations of CEOs’ stakeholder management. A series of analyses shows strong support for our predictions, offering novel insights into the role of CEOs’ agency and communion in influencing CEOs’ career outcomes following stakeholder regulatory sanctions.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.17114 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Routing a Vehicle to Collect Data After an EarthquakeIn the immediate aftermath of a major earthquake, it is crucial to quickly and accurately assess structural damage throughout the region. It is especially important to identify buildings that have become unsafe in order to prioritize evacuation efforts. Only a very small number of building inspections can be feasibly performed in a narrow time frame; however, their results can then be combined with other data sources to predict damage at other locations that were not inspected. In “D-Optimal Orienteering for Postearthquake Reconnaissance Planning,” Wang, Xie, Ryzhov, Marković, and Ou present a novel nonlinear integer program that combines vehicle routing with a statistical objective, the goal being to maximize data quality. An exact method based on row and column generation is developed to solve problems with up to 200 buildings. The approach is validated in a realistic case study using real-world building data obtained from a state-of-the-art earthquake simulator.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate a structural, nominal, life-cycle portfolio choice model with exogenous housing tenure and use shopping costs to generate money demand. Homeowners (renters) with negative (positive) net bond positions react differently to changing inflation risks. The correlation between real bond and real stock returns emerges as the strongest inflation risk quantitatively and generates large increases in stock market demand for homeowners in a 1970s counterfactual. Higher expected inflation encourages stock market participation but affects negatively poorer households without access to that adjustment. A more negative inflation-bond return correlation pushes homeowners more into the stock market, whereas poorer renters move into money.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02007 .</content>

    <title>Uncertain Search with Knowledge Transfer</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a sequential search over a group of similar alternatives. The individual value of an alternative contains two components: an observable utility and an idiosyncratic value. Observable utilities share an unknown population distribution, which captures the similarity across the alternatives and allows for knowledge transfer within the group. Once a decision maker encounters an alternative, its utility is revealed immediately, whereas the idiosyncratic value is unobservable and needs to be learned by sampling. The goal is to select an alternative with the highest individual value, accounting for the sampling and search costs. A novel feature of this problem is the combination of the individual and population levels of learning. We formulate the problem as a Bayesian dynamic program and characterize the optimal policy by a threshold structure. We show that it depends on the difference between the mean estimates of the current alternative and the population. It is optimal to continue sampling if the difference is between a threshold pair; otherwise, accept the current alternative if it exceeds the upper threshold, and switch to a new one if it is below the lower threshold. Other structural properties are also derived to shed light on the effects of the two levels of learning. A key insight is that more uncertainty is preferable at the individual level, but less uncertainty is preferable at the population level.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We exploit differences in two industry classification schemes to distinguish betweenindustry classification misfitsandindustry corefirms. We posit that misfits differ from their industry peers, and we document consequences of this heterogeneity. Misfits have larger absolute abnormal accruals, firms in industries with a greater proportion of misfits have larger absolute abnormal accruals, and contemporaneous abnormal accruals are associated with future restatements for industry core firms but not for misfits. We attribute these results to measurement error generated by the inclusion of misfits in the estimation of accrual models. We then provide guidance to alleviate this issue. For both misfits and industry core firms, using fixed peer groups based on the largest firms in a given industry significantly outperforms other peer selection methods in detecting abnormal accruals. In additional analyses, we highlight other economic consequences of industry classification misfits such as higher information processing costs.</content>

    <title>Setting Up the Gap? Gender Differences in Initial Salary Offers in Hiring</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One common explanation for the gender wage gap is that women have less favorable negotiation outcomes than men in labor markets. Yet, women might also start out with lower offers upon which negotiations occur. A challenge in examining the latter explanation has been that salaries, not salary offers, have been previously available to researchers. In this study, we overcome this empirical challenge by obtaining data on more than 700,000 initial salary offers provided to job candidates in the United States from 2017 to 2020. This allows us to conduct the first wide-scale investigation of initial salary offers in the literature. We hypothesize that a gender offer gap exists and that it is larger in masculine-typed occupations than in feminine-typed occupations. Consistent with our arguments, we find a gender offer gap of 5.5%, net of detailed controls for job, employer, occupation, industry, location, and human capital characteristics. Additionally, we find suggestive evidence that the gender offer gap is larger in occupations with more masculine-typed tasks compared with occupations with more feminine-typed tasks. We close with a discussion of how an understanding of the gender offer gap contributes to research on gender inequality, labor markets, and organizations.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17883 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The short-selling of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) creates “phantom” ETF shares, trading at market prices, with cash flow rights but no associated voting rights. Unlike regular ETF shares backed by underlying securities, which are voted as directed by the ETF sponsor, phantom ETF shares are typically hedged by the underlying basket as part of market-making activities and result in a significant number of sidelined votes of underlying securities. We find that increases in phantom shares for the corresponding underlying securities are associated with decreases in the number of proxy votes cast and increases in broker nonvotes.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01567 .</content>

    <title>Swipe right: When and why conservatives are more accepting of &lt;scp&gt;AI&lt;/scp&gt; recommendations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Six studies (N= 1548) and a single ad study on Facebook examine the influence of political ideology on the likelihood of accepting AI‐generated recommendations in categories such as movie streaming, music streaming, and recipe websites. Contrary to conventional wisdom and prior empirical findings that conservatives are less accepting of technology, the current research finds that conservatives are more likely than liberals to accept AI‐generated recommendations. This occurs because conservatives have a higher resistance to change in general, which leads them to have a greater preference for consistency in consumption contexts. Consequently, given the widely held belief that AI‐generated recommendations are primarily based on one's own past preferences and behaviors, such recommendations are found to be more appealing to conservatives than liberals. However, this effect is attenuated when consumers recognize or infer that the AI lacks knowledge of their past preferences and behaviors. These findings contribute to the literature on the predictive power of political ideology for a litany of consumption‐relevant behaviors while also adding nuance to our understanding of the relationship between political ideology and acceptance of new technology.</content>

    <title>Optimal Dynamic Advertising Policies in Digital and Traditional Channels: A Control-Theoretic Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study applies optimal control theory to investigate a monopolistic firm’s optimal allocation of advertising efforts across digital and traditional channels. By considering the competitive relationship between advertising efforts in different channels in satisfying consumers’ informational needs, this study explicitly models their substitution effect. Furthermore, we propose an alternative approach to incorporate different decay rates of incremental goodwill in the two channels, allowing the system dynamics to be directly represented by the firm’s total goodwill without separating it into multiple channel-specific components. Technically, this approach leads to the system dynamics being governed by an integro-differential equation rather than an ordinary differential equation. Our analysis reveals that the marginal value of goodwill in the digital channel is greater than that in the traditional channel due to a lower decay rate. However, this comparative advantage of the digital channel progressively diminishes over time. As a result, the firm should always invest in digital advertising, while employing traditional advertising only when the comparative advantage of the digital channel becomes weak in later stages. When additionally considering the synergistic effect between the two channels, the optimal adoption timing of traditional advertising occurs earlier as the intensity of synergistic effect increases.</content>

    <title>Virtual Team Efficacy Theory: An Integrative Sociotechnical Understanding of the Emergence and Ramifications of Collective Efficacy in Virtual Teams</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Virtual Team Efficacy TheoryDigital technologies facilitate interactions among geographically distributed virtual team members. However, some organizations treat communication technologies as passive tools rather than active actors influencing the relationships between collaborative parties. Researchers have encouraged this indifference by applying concepts developed for traditional teams in studies focused on virtual teams facing the unique challenge of utilizing technology to overcome constraints such as temporal and geographical dispersion. For example, collective-level efficacy, or the collective belief in the ability to collaborate effectively, is a crucial factor influencing traditional team performance, now being applied in virtual team studies. Yet researchers regularly apply collective-level efficacy concepts that do not account for the idiosyncratic nature of technology-mediated teamwork. This approach provides an incomplete view of how collective-level efficacy forms and operates during virtual collaborations. Reinforcing this lack of clarity, most studies concentrate on empirically assessing collective-level efficacy’s relationships with other variables rather than on how it develops and functions in these settings. Thus, a notable omission from the practitioner and academic literature is a focus on the nature, evolution, and consequences of collective-level efficacy in technology-mediated virtual team settings. The current study addresses this need by developing a conceptual model explaining how virtual team efficacy, a virtual team-specific conceptualization of collective-level efficacy, emerges and subsequently impacts downstream outcomes during a collective cognitive process unique to virtual settings.</content>

    <title>Family Highs, Career Ties: The Benefits of Family‐To‐Work Enrichment for Work Promotion Focus, Networking, and Career Opportunities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traditional work‐family research often frames family responsibilities as constraints on career success, emphasizing conflict over enrichment. This study challenges this perspective by integrating traditional work‐family theory with regulatory focus theory, showing how family‐to‐work enrichment and conflict shape employees' work promotion focus, networking behaviors, and the development of professional social networks. Across a series of four studies using multiple methodologies, we investigate both short‐ and long‐term effects. A 10‐day experience sampling study of working professionals (N= 50) demonstrates that daily fluctuations in family‐to‐work interactions influence professional networking behaviors. On days with greater family‐to‐work enrichment, employees report higher promotion focus and increased network building behaviors, whereas family‐to‐work conflict reduces promotion focus and dampens networking activity. A scenario‐based experiment (N= 409) bolsters this finding, showing that family‐to‐work enrichment enhances, while family‐to‐work conflict diminishes employees' likelihood of engaging in networking behaviors. An examination of longer‐term effects on the professional social networks of participants in a corporate leadership development program (N= 137) finds that sustained family‐to‐work enrichment is linked to both larger and more diverse career guidance networks, a key driver of professional success. A LinkedIn follow‐up study (N= 115) extends these findings by showing that family‐to‐work enrichment relates to the size of professional social networks and career opportunities. By bridging work‐family and career research, this study reframes family as a potential resource, highlighting its role in shaping goal‐directed network building behaviors, professional networks, and ultimately, career opportunities. Practically, these findings underscore the importance of family‐to‐work enrichment as a strategic advantage for employees.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Smarter Inventory Control Through Policy MixingCoordinating inventory across multiple warehouses and retail stores becomes significantly more complex when fixed ordering costs and lost sales are involved. The paper “Near-Optimal Mixed (s,S) Policy for a Multiwarehouse, Multistore Inventory System with Lost Sales and Fixed Cost,” introduces a novel solution to this challenge. By leveraging Lagrangian relaxation, the authors develop a mixed (s,S) policy that assigns two carefully selected ordering strategies to each store: one for the early phase of the selling horizon and another for the later phase. This structured mix allows the policy to approximate the optimal solution, satisfying inventory constraints and managing costs effectively. The approach achieves a provable near-optimality guarantee and highlights the power of combining simple policies to tackle complex supply chain problems.</content>

    <title>Integrated Fleet and Demand Control for On-Demand Meal Delivery Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show how integrated fleet and demand control can be effectively used to benefit all stakeholders in on-demand restaurant meal delivery. Fleet control—that is, the assignment of orders to couriers—is the main control mechanism to steer delivery operations. Another, mostly overlooked, control mechanism is demand control via display optimization—that is, the ordering of restaurants’ display positions on the meal delivery platform. Based on historical customer interactions with a meal delivery platform, we reveal that display positions have a major effect on customers’ restaurant choices. We then leverage this effect by proposing an integrated, scalable reinforcement learning approach that simultaneously optimizes fleet and demand control. We employ our solution method on simulations of large-scale on-demand meal delivery operations with endogenous customer behavior to derive managerial insights on the value of integrated fleet and demand control. Our results demonstrate that integrated fleet and demand control reduces delays experienced by customers, allows for more services per driver, decreases total travel time per driver, guarantees fresher meals, and provides equal opportunities for all participating restaurants. Our results further highlight that selling display positions may cause operational inflexibility and, therefore, may cause significant delays in the fulfillment process. Finally, we show that careful display optimization not only improves service quality, but also platform revenue.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Funding: Financial support from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; German Research Foundation) [Project 510629371] is gratefully acknowledged.

    <title>A Primal-Dual Approach to Constrained Markov Decision Processes with Applications to Queue Scheduling and Inventory Management</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In many operations management problems, we need to make decisions sequentially to minimize the cost, satisfying certain constraints. One modeling approach to such problems is the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). In this work, we develop a data-driven primal-dual algorithm to solve CMDPs. Our approach alternatively applies regularized policy iteration to improve the policy and subgradient ascent to maintain the constraints. Under mild regularity conditions, we show that the algorithm converges at rate [Formula: see text], where T is the number of iterations, for both the discounted and long-run average cost formulations. Our algorithm can be easily combined with advanced deep learning techniques to deal with complex large-scale problems with the additional benefit of straightforward convergence analysis. When the CMDP has a weakly coupled structure, our approach can further reduce the computational complexity through an embedded decomposition. We apply the algorithm to two operations management problems: multiclass queue scheduling and multiproduct inventory management. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm, when combined with appropriate value function approximations, generates policies that achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art heuristics.This paper was accepted by Baris Ata, stochastic models and simulation.Funding: Y.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider platform competition when platforms can (1) commercialize users’ data and in return offer their services for free (data-based business model); (2) protect users’ privacy and charge users for participation (subscription-based model); or (3) offer both options (the hybrid model). We find that competition does not always motivate the incumbent platform to protect users’ privacy. When network effects are intermediate, competition can motivate the incumbent to shift from the subscription-based model to the hybrid model, thereby increasing data commercialization. Yet, the opposite case occurs when network effects are weak. Moreover, allowing the incumbent to adopt the hybrid model is welfare enhancing when network effects are strong and welfare reducing (or neutral) otherwise.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by the Henry Crown Institute, the Eli Hurvitz Institute on Strategic Management, the NET Institute, and the Coller Foundation [Grant 0612017311].Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07744 .</content>

    <title>When Performance Appraisals Fail: Emotion Regulation and the Direction of Organizational Routines</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite their ubiquity, there is much uncertainty as to whether performance appraisals work, and considerable evidence as to their shortfalls. Drawing on the sociological literature on routine dynamics, we examine the embeddedness of the performance appraisal, the role of emotions, exploring what goes on during the process, and how as a routine, appraisals may be diverted onto a trajectory increasingly incompatible with organizational goals. Previous studies have explored how managers may successfully intervene when routines become dysfunctional; we explore when and how this becomes difficult or impossible. We assess how negative emotions introduce a layer of backstage complexity to the appraisal routine. It is based on professional service firms' subsidiaries in a Middle Eastern context, where informal rules and network ties may subvert formal organizational ones. The study identifies distancing, working around, and buffering, as key responses to current and anticipated future negative affective events. It highlights how emotions are not simply antecedents or consequences in the appraisal process; they are experienced throughout the process, accompanying each action, interaction, and event. This study extends routine dynamics and performance appraisal literature by highlighting the emotional dimension's intervening role and examining actors' contending subjectivities. We emphasize how actors shape appraisal routines in diverse and individualistic ways at the micro‐level.</content>

    <title>The Illusion of Authenticity in Online Reviews: Truth Bias and the Role of Valence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As consumer awareness of fake online reviews grows, platforms face increasing challenges in maintaining trust. Although skepticism toward reviews is rising, our research finds that consumers still exhibit a “truth bias,” meaning that they tend to accept individual reviews as genuine—even when fake review detection rates are low. This highlights the need for platforms to proactively identify and address fraudulent content rather than relying on user reporting of suspected fakes, which is largely ineffective. Platforms might also consider labeling suspected fake reviews with warning badges or fact-check indicators. Additionally, we find that truth bias is stronger for negative reviews, making fake negative reviews particularly impactful and damaging. Consequently, platforms should prioritize detecting and mitigating fake negative reviews over fake positive ones. Our findings also suggest that structuring reviews into separate positive and negative sections or allowing (or defaulting to) valence-based review sorting might reduce consumer likelihood of being fooled by fake negative reviews. These insights inform platform policy by emphasizing the importance of proactive fraud detection, transparent labeling, and interface design in safeguarding consumer trust and lowering fraud.</content>

    <title>Applying While Black: The Collateral Effects of Racial Differences in Work Histories</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is well known that hiring practices that treat job seekers differently by race contribute to racial disparities in employment. Yet, practices that treat job seekers equivalently may also contribute to racial disparities if there are pre-existing racial differences among the applicants. We focus on employers’ prominent practice of using job seekers’ work histories to make inferences about their suitability for jobs. Scholars and practitioners alike have long assumed that work histories are race neutral because they result from job seekers’ strategic choices about where to apply and what jobs to accept. However, Black job seekers face structural constraints—namely, anticipating and experiencing racial discrimination—that restrict the job search strategies and resulting jobs available to them. As a result, they are less likely than their White peers to construct the work histories that employers value—those composed of prior experience closely related to the job at hand and specialized within a narrow domain of work. These differences in work histories contribute to the racial disparities that Black job seekers experience. We test and find support for this argument, using over 490,000 job applications for all 3,683 publicly posted jobs over seven years at two U.S. technology companies. This study contributes to the literature on racial discrimination and categorization in labor markets by uncovering a novel pathway through which race shapes employment.</content>

    <title>Micro‐transitions and work identity: The case of academic entrepreneurs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how academic entrepreneurs—scientists who found research‐based startups while remaining in academia—construct and sustain their professional identities amid frequent transitions between academic and entrepreneurial roles. Drawing on 27 interviews with Swedish academic entrepreneurs, we show that hybrid identities are not simply the result of reconciling abstract role categories but are shaped through the material and practical organization of everyday work. We introduce the concept of professional micro‐transitions as a key site of identity formation and argue that material artifacts and routines play a central role in this process. This study contributes to the literatures on identity work, role transitions, and academic entrepreneurship by offering a granular, materially grounded account of how hybrid identities are enacted and sustained in practice.Managerial SummaryThis article investigates how academic entrepreneurs—university scientists who create startups to commercialize research results while remaining in academia—manage to build a hybrid professional identity when frequently switching back and forth between their jobs as academics and for‐profit entrepreneurs. The findings reveal how they creatively find cross‐fertilizing effects between their academic and entrepreneurial work tasks. This in turn allows them to reevaluate and extend their professional identity. For universities, incubators, and policymakers, this study suggests that supporting academic entrepreneurship is not just about funding or IP policies. It also requires recognizing the practical identity work involved and creating flexible environments that allow scientists to integrate both roles in meaningful ways.</content>

    <title>Collective Bargaining for Women: How Unions Can Create Female-Friendly Jobs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the role of unions in improving workplaces for women. Starting in 2015, Brazil’s largest trade union federation made women central to its agenda. Using a difference-in-differences design that leverages variation in union affiliation to this federation, we find that “bargaining for women” increased female-friendly amenities in collective bargaining agreements and in practice. These changes led women to queue for jobs at treated establishments and separate from them less—both revealed preference measures of firm value. We find no evidence that gains came at the expense of wages, employment, or firm profits. Better amenities instead reduced turnover and absenteeism, suggesting greater worker satisfaction and effort. Larger improvements occurred where women initially comprised a lower share of workers or union leaders. Our findings show that shifting union priorities toward women improved workplaces without meaningful trade-offs and instead benefited both workers and employers. They illustrate the potential for unions to improve workplace quality by focusing on the needs of less represented workers.</content>

    <title>Credible Cheap-Talk Communication of Private Demand Information on Both the Forecast Average and Accuracy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A canonical setting in supply chain research is one in which a retailer sources a product, under a wholesale price contract, from a manufacturer that invests in capacity in advance of the retailer’s order. When the retailer possesses private information about demand, it is well understood that credible cheap-talk communication is not possible absent considerations of trust or the reactive setting of the wholesale price. This understanding is based on the practice of demand information being shared as a point forecast. Motivated by the fact that some firms are now sharing information on forecast uncertainty along with the mean, we revisit the canonical setting but allow the retailer to communicate its average demand and its forecast accuracy and allow the manufacturer to have multiple sources of capacity. We establish that credible and informative communication emerges in equilibrium under very general conditions. Moreover, when the manufacturer has multiple sources of capacity that differ in reservation and execution costs, the communication can be influential, strictly improve the manufacturer’s expected profit, and result in a Pareto improvement of supply chain profits. Our results suggest that both the forecast average and accuracy should be communicated in a supply chain not only because upstream firms benefit from a quantification of uncertainty but because communicating information about forecast accuracy (in addition to average demand) enhances the credibility of communication. We establish that improvements to the manufacturer’s capacity portfolio (e.g., expansion or cost reduction) can hurt the manufacturer because of an associated reduction in information revelation. This negative effect can occur if the improvement alters or impacts the resource that, in isolation, provides the highest optimal service level.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02726 .</content>

    <title>Price Informativeness and Corporate Investment: A Model of Costly Manipulation and Share Repurchases</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We characterize how managers can curb manipulation by signaling information via stock repurchases in an environment with costly short selling and feedback effects from trading to firms’ access to capital. Without repurchases, manipulation coexists with informed trading at low shorting costs, reducing price informativeness and firm investment. Manipulation becomes less profitable as shorting costs increase, making prices more informative and boosting investment if speculators are less informed. Incentives to manipulate cease to exist at moderate short selling costs, but making shorting more costly reduces price informativeness and firm investment. Our model shows how contracts that precommit funding and condition future investment on stock prices can induce managers to eliminate manipulation through stock repurchases, facilitating optimal investment policies. An important policy implication is that when stock repurchases are allowed and shorting costs are low, short selling bans will typically reduce investment efficiency.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.</content>

    <title>The Strength of Weak Commitments: A Theory of Price Preannouncements</title>

    <author>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Manufacturers often preannounce reference prices for products that have not yet been produced or even developed. These prices are rarely binding, meaning that the manufacturers can make price adjustments in the future, possibly at a cost. In this paper, we argue that price preannouncements can serve as a weak price commitment that, we find, helps the manufacturers secure better deals from their suppliers, thereby lowering their procurement costs and improving their profit. Surprisingly, even an extremely weak price commitment can substantially improve a manufacturer’s profit. On the other hand, when the price commitment is credible enough, the manufacturer forgoes the price preannouncement. Collectively, these results underscore the strategic effects that price preannouncements can have on firms’ marketing decisions.This paper was accepted by Dmitry Kuksov, marketing.Funding: Financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72422007] and the Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee [Grants 11502221 and 16501523] is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02020 .</content>

    <title>Last-Iterate Convergence in No-Regret Learning: Games with Reference Effects Under Logit Demand</title>
    <updated>2025-05-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This work examines the behaviors of the online projected gradient ascent (OPGA) algorithm and its variant in a repeated oligopoly price competition under reference effects. In particular, we consider that multiple firms engage in a multiperiod price competition, where consecutive periods are linked by the reference price update and each firm has access only to its own first-order feedback. Consumers assess their willingness to pay by comparing the current price against the memory-based reference price, and their choices follow the multinomial logit (MNL) model. We use the notion of stationary Nash equilibrium (SNE), defined as the fixed point of the equilibrium pricing policy, to simultaneously capture the long-run equilibrium and stability. We first study the loss-neutral reference effects and show that if the firms employ the OPGA algorithm—adjusting the price using the first-order derivatives of their log-revenues—the price and reference price paths attain last-iterate convergence to the unique SNE, thereby guaranteeing the no-regret learning and market stability. Moreover, with appropriate step-sizes, we prove that this algorithm exhibits a convergence rate of [Formula: see text] in terms of the squared distance and achieves a constant dynamic regret. Despite the simplicity of the algorithm, its convergence analysis is challenging due to the model lacking typical properties such as strong monotonicity and variational stability that are ordinarily used for the convergence analysis of online games. The inherent asymmetry nature of reference effects motivates the exploration beyond loss-neutrality. When loss-averse reference effects are introduced, we propose a variant of the original algorithm named the conservative-OPGA (C-OPGA) to handle the nonsmooth revenue functions and show that the price and reference price achieve last-iterate convergence to the set of SNEs with the rate of [Formula: see text]. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality and robustness of OPGA and C-OPGA by theoretically showing that these algorithms can also adapt to firm-differentiated step-sizes and inexact gradients.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization and decision analytics.Funding: J.

    <title>Translation of equality, diversity, and inclusion ideas in a foreign subsidiary</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Drawing on a sociological approach, this paper examines how the subsidiaries of multinational companies (MNCs) translate equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) ideas from their headquarters (HQs). International business (IB) studies emphasize the context-sensitive and socially constructed nature of EDI. Through a single case study of an Italian subsidiary translating EDI ideas from its U.S. HQs, we present a power-laden EDI translation process and broaden the extant research by revealing the power relations underlying the EDI translation process. We portray the sociology of MNCs in which different professional categories engage in “translation spaces”, i.e., social spaces where they interact throughout various phases of the translation process. Specifically, we identify two key phases: the signification and negotiation phases. In these phases, intentional and unintentional translators play varying roles in either facilitating or hindering the translation of EDI ideas within the subsidiary. Thus, we first advance the sociology of EDI translation in IB by revealing how EDI understanding is constructed and reconstructed through the interactions of translators. Second, we contribute to translation research in IB by depicting the iterative and recursive nature of the translation process. Finally, we reveal forms of resistance to EDI and the emergence of new power relations shaped by professional diversity within the subsidiary, unearthing the generative nature of the EDI translation process in MNCs.</content>

    <title>Consumers’ Mental Representation of Expenditures: Implications for Spending and Savings Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;People’s mental representation of expenditures is crucial to their budgeting. This article proposes that much like how they represent natural kinds (e.g., animals and plants), people represent expenditures in a hierarchical taxonomy. Seven studies, supported by six norming studies and three pilots, revealed that expenditures are represented hierarchically. We first recover people’s mental representations using a successive pile-sort method that asks people to form hierarchies of categories with common expenditures (e.g., rent, dining out, etc). The pile-sort reveals consensus in people’s representations of expenditures and that these representations are relatively stable over time. Further, people’s adjustment in their spending behavior can be predicted by the distance between items in their representation. Specifically, when people overspent on an item, they spontaneously adjust spending more on taxonomically closer items. We examine this spontaneous adjustment behavior using both lab studies and field data with 6.5 million grocery shopping trips over twelve years. The findings highlight the connection between mental representation and consumer behavior, and they emphasize the importance of studying concepts and categories in the context of consumption.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Whereas much research has focused on the predictors of entrepreneurial behavior during adulthood, we know little about how preadulthood experiences influence entrepreneurial behavior later in life. Grounded in imprinting theory, this study examines whether introducing economics classes in school enhances students’ entrepreneurial behavior in adulthood. Using a difference-in-differences approach exploiting curriculum reforms in Germany, we find that participating in economics classes increases students’ later entrepreneurial activities by four percentage points. We also investigate the underlying mechanism and find that the impact on entrepreneurial behavior is driven by individual-centered rather than market-centered economics curricula.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What characteristics of news generate over-or-underreaction? We study the asset-pricing consequences of diagnostic expectations, a model of belief formation based on the representativeness heuristic, in a setting where news events are drawn from categories with extreme distributions of fundamentals. Our model predicts greater over-reaction to news belonging to categories with more extreme outliers, or tail events. We test our theory on a comprehensive database of corporate news that includes news from 24 different categories, including earnings announcements, product launches, M&amp;A, business expansions, and client-related news. We find theory-consistent heterogeneity in investor reaction to news, with more overreaction in the form of greater post-announcement return reversals and trading volume for news categories with more extreme distributions of fundamentals.</content>

    <title>How Important Is Health Inequality for Lifetime Earnings Inequality?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a dynamic panel approach, we provide empirical evidence that negative health shocks significantly reduce earnings. The effect is primarily driven by the participation margin and is concentrated among the less educated and those in poor health. Next, we develop a life-cycle model of labour supply featuring risky and heterogeneous frailty profiles that affect individuals’ productivity, likelihood of access to social insurance, disutility from work, mortality, and medical expenses. Individuals can either work or not work and apply for social security disability insurance (SSDI/SSI). Eliminating health inequality in our model reduces the variance of log lifetime (accumulated) earnings by 28% at age 55. About 60% of this effect is due to the impact of poor health on the probability of obtaining SSDI/SSI benefits. Despite this, we show that eliminating the SSDI/SSI program reduces ex ante welfare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For standard statistical problems, we provide new evidence documenting (1) multimodality and (2) instability in probability estimates, including from irrelevant changes in problem description. The evidence motivates a model in which, when solving a problem, people represent each hypothesis by attending to its salient features while neglecting other, potentially more relevant, ones. Only the statistics associated with salient features are used. The model unifies biases in judgments about i.i.d. draws, such as the Gambler's Fallacy and insensitivity to sample size, with biases in inference such as under- and overreaction and insensitivity to the weight of evidence. The model makes predictions for how changes in the salience of specific features jointly shapes known biases and measured attention to features, but also create entirely new biases. We test and confirm these predictions experimentally. Salience-driven attention to features emerges as a unifying framework for biases conventionally explained using a variety of stable heuristics or distortions of Bayes' rule.</content>

    <title>Efficient Conservation of the Brazilian Amazon: Estimates from a Dynamic Model</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper estimates the Brazilian Amazon’s carbon-efficient forest cover—i.e. when farmers internalize the social cost of carbon. We propose a dynamic discrete choice land-use model and estimate it using a panel of land use and carbon stock of 5.7 billion pixels between 2008 and 2017. The business-as-usual scenario implies an inefficient release of 42 billion tons of CO2 in the long run, resulting from the deforestation of an area twice the size of France. A carbon tax that makes farmers internalize the social cost of carbon would implement the efficient allocation and generate welfare gains exceeding 1.6 trillion dollars. Responses from a carbon tax are highly convex: a carbon tax of only $10/ton would preserve 95% of the efficient carbon stock. An excise tax on cattle ranching, a second-best policy, achieves at most 87% of the first-best welfare gains.</content>

    <title>Cascades and Fluctuations in an Economy with an Endogenous Production Network</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article studies the efficient allocation in an economy in which firms are connected through input–output linkages and must pay a fixed cost to produce. When economic conditions are poor, some firms might decide not to operate, thereby severing the links with their neighbours and changing the structure of the production network. Since producers benefit from having access to additional suppliers, nearby firms tend to operate, or not, together. As a result, the production network features clusters of operating firms, and the exit of a producer can create a cascade of firm shutdowns. While well-connected firms are better able to withstand shocks, they trigger larger cascades upon exit. The theory also predicts how the structure of the production network changes over the business cycle. As in the data, recessions are associated with more dispersed networks that feature fewer highly connected firms. In the calibrated economy, the endogenous reorganization of the network substantially dampens the impact of idiosyncratic shocks on aggregate fluctuations.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Impact of Recreational Marijuana Legalization on Hotel Performance and Operations: A Bayesian Causal Inference Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article investigates the effects of legalizing recreational marijuana dispensaries on hotel performance and operations using Bayesian causal inference within the potential outcomes framework. Focusing on Colorado, the study finds that, on average, hotel revenue increases by 25.2% (or $63,671 monthly) due to dispensary legalization, with the effect continuing to grow even six years after legalization. The revenue boost arises from a 7.9% increase in room night bookings and a 16.0% rise in daily room rates. The impact, however, varies depending on hotel characteristics, such as the distance to dispensaries, age, class, location types, and operating structure, with greater effects seen in hotels that are closer to dispensaries, younger in age, more upscale, located in areas populated with potential recreational marijuana consumers (e.g., resort, urban, airport), and managed directly by corporate entities. Furthermore, hotels expand their room inventory by 3.9% in response to the legalization of retail dispensaries, partially mediating the revenue impact. These findings are relevant for professionals in marketing, operations management, hospitality, tourism, and public policy.</content>

    <title>Dynamic Pricing with Fairness Constraints</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Personalized prices can boost revenue, but they increasingly draw fire for hidden discrimination. A new study, “Dynamic Pricing with Fairness Constraints,” by Maxime C. Cohen, Sentao Miao, and Yining Wang, shows that firms can learn demand while staying fair at the same time. The authors embed two complementary notions of fairness into the classic learning-and-earning problem. The first, price fairness, limits price gaps across customer groups and over time, whereas the second, demand fairness, keeps realized demand shares balanced. To enforce price fairness, the authors design FaPU, an infrequently updated upper confidence bound algorithm that respects both group and temporal limits while securing near-optimal regret and matching lower bounds. For demand fairness, they propose FaPD, a primal-dual learner that meets aggregate demand quotas with high probability and the same near-optimal regret rate. Beyond providing tight theoretical analyses, the paper quantifies the “price of fairness” and outlines extensions to non-stationary markets, offering regulators and practitioners evidence that equity and profitability can coexist in algorithmic pricing.</content>

    <title>Event-Triggered Bayesian Control Chart</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Control charts are practical tools for fault detection and recovery. However, traditional control charts rely on random samples collected from a production process at fixed time intervals, causing late detection if sampling intervals are too long or excessive sampling if the intervals are too short. In “Event-Triggered Bayesian Control Chart,” Abbou and Makis develop a novel control chart leveraging real-time data from smart sensors to jointly decide when to collect samples and when to stop the production process, leading to quick fault detection and recovery using few samples. Applying optimal stopping theory and dynamic programming analysis, the authors establish the average-cost optimality of their control chart and propose an efficient procedure for computing the optimal sampling and stopping thresholds. Through an empirical study, the control chart is shown to achieve substantial cost savings compared to benchmarks. Furthermore, thanks to its event-triggering mechanism, the proposed control chart requires little data communication from sensors, which is crucial from an energy-efficiency perspective.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Workers spend a significant amount of time learning how to make good decisions. Evaluating the efficacy of a given decision, however, can be complicated—for example, decision outcomes are often long-term and relate to the original decision in complex ways. Surprisingly, even though learning good decision-making strategies is difficult, the strategies can often be expressed in simple and concise forms. Focusing on sequential decision making, we design a novel machine learning algorithm that is capable of extracting “best practices” from trace data and conveying its insights to humans in the form of interpretable “tips.” Our algorithm selects the tip that best bridges the gap between the actions taken by human workers and those taken by the optimal policy in a way that accounts for which actions are consequential for achieving higher performance. We evaluate our approach through a series of randomized controlled experiments where participants manage a virtual kitchen. Our experiments show that the tips generated by our algorithm can significantly improve human performance relative to intuitive baselines. In addition, we discuss a number of empirical insights that can help inform the design of algorithms intended for human-AI interfaces. For instance, we find evidence that participants do not simply blindly follow our tips; instead, they combine them with their own experience to discover additional strategies for improving performance.This paper has been This paper was accepted by Elena Katok for the Special Issue on The Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: This work was supported by the Mack Institute for Innovation Management, the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Open Research Commons, and The Wharton Behavioral Lab.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02455 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many high-end retailers operate off-price or discount versions of their full-line stores to engage value-conscious customers. In this study, the authors empirically examine the effects of a high-end retailer’s opening of off-price stores on customer behavior. Leveraging a unique customer-level dataset spanning pre- and post-opening periods of off-price stores in the United States by a multichannel retailer, the authors disentangle the effects of physical off-price store opening on the incumbent channels (full-line physical stores and online store) and document the underlying mechanisms. The authors employ thegroup-time treatment effectsdoubly robust estimator that exploits the staggered opening of multiple off-price stores. The authors find that off-price store opening decreases customer spending (substitution effect or value customer effect) at the full-line store and increases spending at the online store (complementarity effect or option to return products effect). The authors report that the retailer’s new customers (i.e., those acquired via the retailer’s off-price stores) tend to spend less, return products at a higher rate, purchase lower-priced items, and are in the lower-income group. Furthermore, the regular customers who shop at the full-line stores of the upscale retailer spend less at and return their online purchases at a higher rate to the off-price stores than the value-conscious customers. The authors perform a battery of robustness checks to rule out effects of confounding factors. Based on the results, the authors offer new insights and implications for high-end multichannel retailers who adopt an off-price store opening strategy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When analyzing a sequence of customer interactions, it is important for firms to understand how these interactions align with key objectives, such as generating qualified customer leads, driving conversion events, or reducing churn. We introduce a transformer-based framework that models customer interactions in a sequence similar to how a sentence is modeled as a sequence of words by Large Language Models. We propose a heterogeneous mixture multi-head self-attention mechanism that captures individual heterogeneity in touchpoint effects. The model identifies self-attention patterns that reflect both population-level trends and the unique relationships between touch points within each customer journey. By assigning varying weights to each attention head, the model accounts for the distinctive aspects of the journey of each user. This results in more accurate predictions, enabling precise targeting and outperforming existing approaches such as hidden Markov models, point process models, and LSTMs. Our empirical application in a multichannel marketing context demonstrates how managers can leverage the model’s features to identify high-potential customers for targeting. Extensive simulations further establish the model’s superiority over competing approaches. Beyond multichannel marketing, our transformer-based model also has broad applicability in customer journeys across other domains.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Consequences of Bottle Bills: How Bottle Deposit Return Schemes Affect Retail Prices and Lead Consumers to Larger Package Sizes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Plastic waste has doubled in the past two decades, and less than 10% of plastic waste is recycled. “Bottle bills” are legislation to combat plastic waste by increasing recycling rates, by adding a per-bottle deposit that gets refunded to consumers who return empty containers. Industry experts are divided over the retail sales and price implications of such measures. To clarify the implications of such legislation, the current study uses a synthetic difference-in-differences approach to investigate how New York’s 2009 law, targeting pure bottled water in containers &lt; 128 fl. oz., affected consumers and retailers in terms of whether prices of bottled beverages changed and whether the bottle bill affected sales of bottled beverages. The study also identifies three mechanisms that can drive such effects. The results reveal that retailers increased prices of items covered by the bottle bill by 4% while keeping prices of other items, outside the bottle bill’s scope, constant. Volume sales in the water category decreased by 6%. This study finds substantial differences in these effects across package sizes and provides suggestive evidence that consumers’ ideological aversion and retailers’ additional operational effort and holding costs are related to these sales and price changes.</content>

    <title>Regulation, Corruption, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations: Insights from Bitcoin Trading and Platform Founding Between 2011 and 2023</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) represent a novel organizational form enabling self-governed coordination based on blockchain technology. This study examines the prototypical Bitcoin DAO from an institutional perspective, focusing on how its core features—decentralization and autonomy—interact with the broader institutional framework in which it operates. Specifically, we study how regulative institutional environments (i.e., (il)legalization) shape the growth and development of DAOs while theorizing about the role of both petty and grand corruption (i.e., by higher-level officials) in influencing the effectiveness of these regulative institutions. Our empirical analysis focuses on the global rise of Bitcoin trading and platform establishment across 49 national contexts from 2011 to 2023. Utilizing a unique data set, we find that, although the number of Bitcoin exchange platforms in a country is positively associated with Bitcoin legalization, Bitcoin trading volume is positively associated with Bitcoin illegalization. In countries with higher levels of grand corruption, Bitcoin illegalization becomes even more strongly associated with trading. In contrast, grand corruption dampens the positive association between legalization and the number of Bitcoin exchange platforms. Further, the presence of petty corruption reduces the impact of grand corruption. Our study reveals that it is critical to distinguish between petty and grand corruption as an important factor that influences the interplay between the regulative environment and growth and development of the Bitcoin DAO and the related ecosystem of Bitcoin trading and platform founding.</content>

    <title>Humans’ Use of AI Assistance: The Effect of Loss Aversion on Willingness to Delegate Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As artificial intelligence (AI) tools have become pervasive in business applications, so too have interactions between AI and humans in business processes and decision-making. A growing area of research has focused on human decision and task delegation to AI assistants. Simultaneously, extensive research on algorithm aversion—humans’ resistance to algorithm-based decision tools—has demonstrated potential barriers and issues with AI applications in business. In this paper, we test a simple strategy for mitigating algorithm aversion in the context of AI task delegation. We show that simply changing the framing of decision tasks can allay algorithm aversion. Through multiple studies, we found that participants exhibited a strong preference for human assistance over AI assistance when they were rewarded for task performance (i.e., money was gained for good performance), even when the AI had been shown to outperform the human assistant on the task. Alternatively, when we reframed the task such that the participant experienced losses for poor performance (i.e., money was taken from their endowment for poor performance), the bias for preferring human assistance was removed. Under loss framing, participants delegated the decision task to human and AI assistants at similar rates. We demonstrate this finding across tasks at differing levels of complexity and at different incentive sizes. We also provide evidence that loss framing increases situational awareness, which drives the observed effects. Our results offer useful insights on reducing algorithm aversion that extend the literature and provide actionable suggestions for practitioners and managers.This paper has been This paper was accepted by Dongjun Wu for the Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05585 .</content>

    <title>Spaces for Creativity: Unconventional Workspaces and Divergent Thinking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Companies are adopting unconventional workspaces—often characterized by bright or oddly colored walls, unique light fixtures, unusual office furniture, vibrant artwork, the display of atypical non–work-related objects, and casual and playful atmospheres—to foster creativity. Yet empirical evidence on the causal effect of such unconventional workspaces on creativity has been lacking. Across four experiments involving a total sample of 1,133 participants, we tested the effect of unconventional workspaces on individuals’ divergent thinking: the process of generating many and distinct ideas to solve a given task. Contrary to our initial expectations, we found that unconventional workspaces did not always boost divergent thinking and even hindered it. Specifically, unconventional workspaces were harmful when solutions for a divergent task could be readily inspired by the workspace’s features because of cognitive anchoring. Hence, the positive effect of unconventional workspaces was significant only when the potential solutions for the divergent-thinking task were unrelated to features of the workspace. These findings provide important evidence of the causal effects of unconventional workspaces on the process of creativity and highlight crucial boundary conditions for such effects.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Funding: This research was supported by the Heinrich and Esther Baumann–Steiner Fund for Creativity and Business at INSEAD and the Center for Organizational Learning, Innovation, and Knowledge at the Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02052 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Innovation contests incentivize the participants’ to exert effort toward combining (recombining) their existing knowledge to create solutions. In the current work, we consider the case of serial contests, where effort to create solutions for earlier contests can also expand the participant’s knowledge, which can then be valuable in future contests. We develop a novel framework that explicitly includes the generation and utilization of knowledge by participants in knowledge-driven serial innovation contests, and we analyze the implications of this framework for optimal incentive design. Analysis of our model reveals that the efforts expended by participants in a contest can depend on future rewards, especially when learning emerges as a “side effect” of execution effort (i.e., learning while doing). In fact, participants will exert effort in an earlier contest even when its associated reward is zero. In contrast, when explicit knowledge generation effort is feasible (i.e., learning before doing), the contest designer should increase the reward for the earlier contest to prevent participants from postponing their learning. Our model demonstrates that whether one should assign higher reward to the earlier or later contest depends on the mode of learning, the participant pool’s ex ante knowledge, and the transferability of learning from one contest to the next.This paper was accepted by Ashish Arora, entrepreneurship and innovation.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03369 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a field study of boards’ emerging responsibility to oversee cybersecurity risk, a setting in which few directors have expertise. We find that, although nonexpert directors may genuinely seek to provide diligent oversight, without expertise their efforts lack substance and therefore are mostly symbolic, even when they perform the same oversight activities as expert directors. We also explore why boards do not prioritize the appointment of cybersecurity experts and show that nonexpert directors do not perceive that their efforts are symbolic and insufficient. In contrast, expert directors perceive keenly the deficiency of their nonexpert counterparts and argue for the need for more cybersecurity experts on boards, and this viewpoint is shared by cybersecurity executives and consultants who support the board. Thus, we contribute to our understanding of when boards are likely to provide substantive versus symbolic oversight and inform the debate on the merits of board-level cybersecurity expertise.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by a Security, Privacy, &amp; Trust grant from the Pamplin College of Business and the Commonwealth Cyber Initiative of Virginia.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04147 .</content>

    <title>Leave the Token, Take the Gavel: How National Quotas and Corporate Ownership Shape Gender Diversity on Major Board Committees</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While gender diversity on boards of directors (BODs) has recently increased, gender diversity on major board committees (MBCs), which influence board decision‐making directly, has advanced more slowly. Our study therefore delves into the antecedents of gender diversity on MBCs. We look at two key drivers: national quotas (policies mandating a minimum percentage of women to be appointed to BODs) and firm ownership (state, institutional, and family ownership). Our results show, contrary to theoretical predictions that are currently prevailing in the literature, that quotas trigger emancipatory rather than tokenistic behaviour in relation to women's appointments to MBCs. More specifically, quotas have a positive effect on gender diversity on MBCs, even when controlling for gender diversity on the BOD. Quota‐based measures can thus be a stepping stone towards positions of real influence on BODs. Furthermore, we find that states and institutional investors are ‘emancipatory’ owners, which support relatively higher gender diversity on MBCs. In contrast, family firms are ‘conservative’ owners, which support relatively lower gender diversity on MBCs. Our study informs the literatures on gender diversity on BODs and ownership‐based perspectives on corporate governance.</content>

    <title>A Racialized Engine of Anxiety? Race, Reactivity, and the Uneven Tax of Credit Scores</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research demonstrates that evaluations made via scores often induce anxiety and alter the behaviors of those being evaluated. Research further suggests that this so-called reactivity is not experienced equally. Yet, scholars do not fully understand what explains this variation.For whomdoes being scored induce reactivity andwhy? Drawing on insights from W.E.B. Du Bois and Frantz Fanon, I argue that the experience of being scored differs across racial groups. I evaluate this claim by using a mixed-methods approach that combines interviews and an original national survey on consumer credit scoring. The interviews demonstrate that Black respondents’ credit scores exact a psychological and behavioral tax as the respondents indicate higher levels of anxiety and feeling that their score is a controlling factor in their lives. In contrast, White respondents recognize the importance of their credit scores for determining access to resources but do not see their scores as more significant beyond that. Survey analyses generalize these findings, showing substantial disparities in reactivity to credit scores between Black and White respondents even after the analyses account for economic factors like differences in their credit scores. These findings reveal credit scores asracialized engines of anxietyand yield new insight into the mechanisms that condition whether and to what extent being scored shapes behaviors.</content>

    <title>How Alternative Management Ideas Are Realized for the Public Good: Performative Fabrics of Humanistic Practices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Repurposing management for the public good involves realizing alternative ideas to serve societal interests. Humanistic management is centred on such ideas as human dignity and well‐being. Realization refers to the generation and maintenance of social realities corresponding to these ideas. The conceptual lens of performativity is uniquely suited for studying realization but requires broadening to capture the wider set of practices involved. Accordingly, we explore the wider performative practices that realize humanistic management ideas and how they do so. We studied three cases through a thematic analysis of 165 interviews, secondary sources, and observations. Our framework explains how humanistic management ideas were realized through performative fabrics of practices, interwoven heterogeneous practices that make and keep the embedded humanistic management ideas real. Performing, interweaving, and reweaving dynamics continuously shape these fabrics of interrelated humanizing, seeding, and nurturing practices. The fabrics generated four types of realizations of humanistic management ideas: potentialities, anomalies, normalities, and transferabilities. We prime a change in the conversation from studies of individual performative practices to relational studies of performative fabrics of practices. We also advance the performativity discussion to understand generativity, stabilization, defence, and reformativity. Our framework contributes theoretically and practically to repurposing management for the public good and offers insight into desirable future making.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study attention utility, the hedonic pleasure or pain derived purely from paying attention to information, which differs from the news utility that arises from gaining new information. The main, field, study examines brokerage account login data to show that investors pay disproportionate attention to already-known positive information on their stocks. Through its effect on logins, this selective attention affects their trading activity. Three experimental studies then show that (1) investors are more likely to engage in a paid task that will involve attention to a prior investment if that investment has gained value; (2) paying attention to a winning stock is more motivating than a doubling of monetary incentives; and that (3) attention has value independent of information acquisition.</content>

    <title>Putting out the Fires: The Role of Team Knowledge, Coordination, and Procedural Rigidity in Adapting and Performing During Disruptive Events</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research develops a theory of team adaptation to disruptive events (the extent to which an event transforms usual activities). Our theory is based on a comprehensive investigation of firefighting teams, documenting how disruptive team task changes (i.e., disruptive events) create a lack of correspondence between what team members expect to happen (preexisting task mental models or TMMs) and what is happening in the situation (emergent team situation mental models or TSMs) and the reactions that assist in their adaptation to these changes. We find that teams navigated the lack of correspondence by shifting from implicit to explicit coordination processes to effectively adapt. In Study 1, we gathered data from 350 firefighters in Chile composing 46 teams performing emergency missions. We find that the more disruptive the events experienced, the less the TMM-TSM corresponded; this relationship was influenced by procedural rigidity as highly rigid procedures impair sensitivity to situational modifications. When teams had low TMM-TSM correspondence, explicit coordination enabled them to save more property and lives. Study 2, employing a laboratory experiment, confirmed that, when low correspondence between TMMs and TSMs resulted in explicit coordination, simulated firefighting teams were better able to accomplish their missions. Across both field and experimental settings, our results extend theory and offer practical guidance to managers regarding how to support teams coping with disruptive events to avoid the dysfunctional consequences of overly rigid protocols.Funding: This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Innovation and Science [Grant PID2020-113394GB-I00] and the Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences [Grant ARI W911NF-16-1-0545].</content>

    <title>Optimal Abort Policy for Mission-Critical Systems Under Imperfect Condition Monitoring</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Controlling stochastic systems often relies on the assumption of Markovian dynamics. However, this assumption frequently breaks down in mission-critical systems subject to failures—such as drones for power grid inspections—where the system failure rate increases over time. To enhance system survivability, operators may choose to abort missions based on noisy condition-monitoring signals. Yet, determining the optimal abort time in such settings leads to an intractable stopping problem under partial observability and non-Markovian behavior. In “Optimal Abort Policy for Mission-Critical Systems Under Imperfect Condition Monitoring,” Sun, Hu, and Ye introduce a novel Erlang mixture-based approximation that transforms the original non-Markovian process into continuous-time Markov chains. This approximation enables the formulation of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), whose optimal policies are shown to converge almost surely to the original optimal abort decision rules as the Erlang rate increases. Structural properties of the optimal POMDP policy are established, and a modified point-based value iteration algorithm is proposed to numerically solve the POMDP.</content>

    <title>Marketplace Expansion Through Marquee Seller Adoption: Externalities and Reputation Implications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the race to establish themselves, many early-stage online marketplaces choose to accelerate their growth by adding marquee (established brand name) sellers. We study the implications of marquee seller entry on smaller, unbranded sellers in a marketplace when both unbranded sellers and marquee sellers can vary vertically across reputation (referred to as sellers’ quality). Although recent literature has shown that higher-quality unbranded sellers fare better than their lower-quality peers, we posit that this may not hold for entrants of any quality. To this end, we collaborate with an online business-to-business platform and exploit the entry of two marquee sellers of vastly differing quality. Using a difference-in-difference-in-differences framework, we causally identify the effect. We find that, although higher-quality unbranded seller revenues increase relative to low-quality unbranded sellers when the entrant is of superior quality (consistent with the literature), the effect is reversed when the entrant is of inferior quality. Further, unbranded sellers change their supply quantities such that the platform’s average supply quality shifts in the direction of entrant quality. Using a stylized theoretical model, we identify two mechanisms that drive our findings: (i) new buyers brought in by the entrant disproportionately favor unbranded sellers who are quality neighbors to the entrant and (ii) the unbranded seller’s ability to adjust their supply quantities. Most notably, the choice of marquee sellers, examined through the lens of their externality on unbranded sellers, can foster or undermine the platform’s long-term growth objectives.This paper was accepted by Victor Martinez de Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03606 .</content>

    <title>The Politics of Product Safety: Top Management Team Political Ideology and Serious Medical Product Recalls</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is growing research exploring the influence of executives’ political ideologies on firm strategy, but little is known about how these ideologies influence product quality. Leveraging research that suggests liberal firm leaders prioritize customer safety, whereas conservative firm leaders emphasize firm financial returns, we theorize that a firm’s top management team’s (TMT’s) political ideology influences the number of serious medical product recalls that a firm initiates and how quickly the firm initiates them. Analyzing political donations recorded by the Federal Election Committee from top executives of 88 firms that had 4,072 serious medical product recalls from 2002 through 2015, we find that as firms’ TMTs are more liberal, they issue fewer recalls, but as firms’ TMTs are more conservative, they initiate recalls faster. Results suggest that firms with TMTs one standard deviation more liberal than the mean issue 1.10 fewer recalls per year, but take 22 days longer to initiate them. Findings from a post hoc analysis lend support to our theorizing, as we find that product quality-related adverse events act as a mechanism explaining the relationship between TMT political ideology and recalls. Firms with more liberal TMTs experience fewer product quality-related adverse events, and this reduction in adverse events acts as a mediator to partially explain the reduction in the number of recalls that more liberal firms initiate. Post hoc analyses provide support for an important firm implication; firms with more politically diverse TMTs have fewer recalls, similar to more liberal TMTs, and faster recalls, similar to more conservative TMTs.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03045 .</content>

    <title>Analytics Capability, Supply Chain Capabilities, and Operational Performance: A Meta‐Analytic Investigation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does the development of Analytics Capability (AC) of a firm influence its supply chain performance? With increasing numbers of firms adopting data analytics to enhance their supply chains and overall performance, this question has become particularly important. To answer the question, this study proposes and tests three dominant supply chain capabilities (integration, flexibility, and resilience) as key mechanisms through which AC is linked with operational performance. We use 405 effect sizes reported in 174 prior empirical studies based on data gathered from 104,296 informants to draw insights using a meta‐analytic structural equation modeling approach. The theory developed herein contributes to the literature by demonstrating thatintegration, flexibility,andresiliencemediate the association between AC and operational performance, which in turn affects customer service performance. Specifically, a substantial degree of variance in the effects of AC on operational performance is mediated by integration, flexibility, and resilience, respectively. We also find that the effect size for the association between AC and operational performance is higher in developing economies, while the link between operational performance and customer service performance is higher in developed economies. Our analyses are robust to several empirical challenges, including (a) common method bias, (b) outliers, (c) endogeneity, and (d) journal quality, attesting to the stability of the findings. Overall, our results suggest that supply chain integration, flexibility, and resilience are key domains of managerial and theoretical focus for implementing firms' data analytics initiatives, reinforcing the role of the supply chain in leveraging data analytics capabilities.</content>

    <title>Fast Fashion Consumption Signals Low Self-Control</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We argue that the fast fashion business model has three defining characteristics: high trendiness, high disposability, and unsustainable practices. These characteristics collectively suggest that consumers of fast fashion brands have a short-term focus, which evokes the perception that they lack self-control. A ChatGPT study and six experiments (five pre-registered) provide convergent evidence for the effect of fast fashion consumption on perceived self-control (H1). We establish that this effect is mediated by the belief that fast fashion consumers maintain a short-term focus (H2). Additionally, fast fashion consumers are viewed as having lower self-control compared to consumers of luxury, mid-luxury, and supermarket fashion (H3). Serious consumers of fast fashion are perceived to have lower self-control than casual consumers (H4). Furthermore, this effect disappears when cues (e.g., sustainability) imply a long-term focus among consumers (H5). Finally, we reveal the downstream consequences of this effect, offering important insights for consumers and marketers. For instance, fast fashion consumers and influencers are seen as less compatible with products, services, jobs, and activities associated with self-control and long-term benefits (H6). Overall, our research enhances our understanding of fast fashion consumption and contributes to broader discussions on self-control, consumption-based inference-making, and interpersonal perception.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study optimal nonlinear taxation of single and married households. Taxes on couples depend on the earnings of both spouses and are an example of multidimensional tax schedules. We develop novel analytical techniques to study properties of such taxes. We show that the optimal marginal taxes for married individuals are generally lower than for single individuals because resource sharing in couples provides socially valuable redistribution. Under realistic assumptions, the optimal tax rates for married individuals increase with the correlation of spousal earnings, the marginal tax rates for one spouse increase (decrease) in the earnings of the other if both spouses have low (high) earnings, and the primary earner faces lower marginal taxes than the secondary earner.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is wide agreement about the potential for hybridity – the combination of plural organizational forms – to address complex societal grand challenges. Unfortunately, advancements in this area have been unduly constrained by the fragmentation of research along the organizational unit of analysis. This Special Issue advances research by offering a framework that bridges hybridity research across the organizational, inter‐organizational, and societal levels of analysis. We introduce a framework of transformational hybridity based on three interlinked mechanisms that drive societal transformation across different levels –Shape up!,Shake up!, andShift up! Shape up!involves changes in organizational and inter‐organizational hybridity practices. In turn,Shake up!involves changes in hybridity boundaries through organizational and inter‐organizational arrangements. Through interplay, these two mechanisms may bring aboutShift up!, a societal transformation that addresses a grand challenge. Taken together, this Special Issue paves the road for novel research directions and equips scholars and practitioners alike with a multi‐level lens for tackling societal grand challenges through transformational hybridity.</content>

    <title>Rethinking Interpersonal Humour in Organizations: Clarifying Constructs and Charting A Path Forward</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizational humour research is accelerating; however, scholars seem to disagree on how to conceptualize and operationalize interpersonal humour. A widely used approach draws from personality psychology and conceptualizes humour as a typology of four styles. This “humour styles” approach possesses conceptual shortcomings and introduces important questions about construct validity. Specifically, the humour styles tend to conflate inferred motives and outcomes within the definition of each style, raising concerns about circularity and tautology. Moreover, its typological foundation – originally developed for an intrapersonal context – becomes less tenable when applied interpersonally. To support the progression of humour scholarship, we begin by clarifying the core construct of humour, which serves as the basis for a broader conceptual critique of the humour styles approach. This critique is then illustrated through a multi‐study research program (N = 1086; six samples). We conclude by proposing the MOHM model (Model of Organizational Humour Motives) as a conceptually grounded alternative to guide future research on interpersonal humour. This research contributes to humour scholarship by clarifying the core humour concept, critiquing a popular approach (which is reducing construct clarity), and offering a forward‐looking framework to inspire more precise and impactful research on humour in organizational settings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects on corporate loan rates of an unexpected change in the Italian legislation that forbade interlocking directorates between banks. Exploiting multiple firm‐bank relationships to fully account for all unobserved heterogeneity, we find that prohibiting interlocks decreased the interest rates of previously interlocked banks by 14 basis points relative to other banks. The effect is stronger for high‐quality firms and for loans extended by interlocked banks with a large joint market share. Interest rates on loans from previously interlocked banks become more dispersed. Finally, firms borrowing more from previously interlocked banks expand investment, employment, and sales.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effect of internal employee coordination on customer trust, focusing specifically on employees’ responsiveness to each other as an important, quantifiable, and objective aspect of internal coordination. Using proprietary data from a company with exogenous assignment of employees to teams that serve individual customers, we study how inter‐employee responsiveness influences customer trust. Each customer is served via an app‐based group chat by a randomly assigned team of employees. Our data include more than 2 million group chat messages with over 16 thousand customers. We find that inter‐employee responsiveness serves as a credible signal that helps build customer trust, as evidenced by their subsequent contracting choices. The effect is more pronounced when the signal is (1) more frequent and (2) more intense. Our findings highlight the novel value of internal employee responsiveness as a credible signal that helps build trust with external stakeholders.</content>

    <title>All That Glitters Is Not Gold: The Impact of Certification Test Costs in Online Labor Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Our study examines how the value of skill certifications changes when an online labor platform eliminates testing fees. Although the policy led to a sharp increase in certification rates and faster hiring, it also reduced the signaling power of certifications. Employers became less likely to hire certified workers or offer them higher pay because their average performance declined. This drop in credibility disproportionately affected inexperienced workers who depended on certifications to establish trust. Importantly, we find that the negative effects of free certification can be reduced through better platform design. Showing more detailed certification information, such as test scores and how recently the certification was earned, helps employers interpret credentials more effectively. These design improvements can help preserve the value of certifications while expanding access.</content>

    <title>Forced to Change? Media Exposure of Labor Issues and Firm Artificial Intelligence Investment</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms are increasingly interested in investing in artificial intelligence (AI), but what drives this trend? Our research reveals that media coverage of labor issues plays a significant role. When firms face public scrutiny through media exposure of labor issues, the reputational pressure pushes them to act. AI emerges as a strategic response, offering powerful capabilities to automate and augment human tasks. Analyzing data from U.S. public firms, we found that labor issue-related media coverage significantly increases AI investments, particularly among firms with the motivation and resources to invest in AI, whereas other IT or general investments are not similarly influenced, suggesting that firms view AI as uniquely suitable to address labor challenges. Interestingly, firms appear to prioritize AI for its automation capabilities, particularly targeting high-skilled labor, contrasting with traditional automation investments focused on lower-skilled tasks. This shift signals a transformation in how companies are reimaging the future of work. For business leaders, our findings also reveal that AI investment not only reduces future media scrutiny but also decreases labor reliance. Policymakers, however, must consider the broader implications, particularly the impact of AI investment on labor markets and the need for proactive workforce planning.</content>

    <title>Pricing Experimental Design: Causal Effect, Expected Revenue and Tail Risk</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When launching a new product, historical sales data are often not available, leaving price as a crucial experimental instrument for sellers to gauge market response. When designing pricing experiments, there are three fundamental objectives: estimating the causal effect of price (i.e., price elasticity), maximizing the expected revenue through the experiment, and controlling the tail risk that, if not controlled, may lead to significant financial losses. In this paper, we reveal the relationship among such three objectives. Under a linear structural model, we investigate the trade-offs between causal effect estimation and expected revenue maximization, as well as between expected revenue maximization and tail risk control. Furthermore, we propose an optimal pricing experimental design, which can flexibly adapt to different desired levels of trade-offs. Through the optimal design, we also explore the relationship between causal effect estimation and tail risk control. Moreover, we establish an always-valid confidence sequence and a central limit theorem for the inference of the causal effect. Finally, we extend our results and the design to a misspecified setting, where the structural model is not necessarily linear but the seller still runs our design for linear structural models. The results demonstrate the robustness of our design and the wide existence of the relationships among the three objectives.This paper was accepted by George Shanthikumar, data science.Funding: The authors thank the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)-IBM partnership in Artificial Intelligence and the MIT Data Science Laboratory for support.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03209 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research suggests that firms with good reputations will work to protect them, as good reputations are assets that attract resources and facilitate market exchanges. But good reputations do not just attract resources and facilitate exchanges; they can also buffer firms from scrutiny. Therefore, this study asks whether organizations with good reputations will still perform well, even if they are less likely to be watched or held accountable for doing poorly. The study bounds its focus to a form of performance that depends on external oversight, in this case through the regulatory governance process. The theory suggests that higher regulatory reputations, as measured through increases in ratings, will lead to weaker monitoring – which, in turn, allows performance to decline in the regulated domain. An analysis of public health outcomes in the cruise travel industry provides support for these predictions. Tests of moderating hypotheses suggest that the direct effect of ratings on performance is stronger when regulators have more power over the organization, and when the organization is not already under scrutiny for poor performance on other ancillary dimensions.</content>

    <title>Desired and Feared Identities and Their Role in Occupational Identity Regulation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper extends theory by showing how occupational identity regulation operates jointly through both desired and feared identities which, in combination, enforce normative control. Taking a narrative identity perspective and drawing on an ethnographic and interview‐based study of veterinarians, we make three principal contributions to our understanding of identity regulation. First, we explain how, in high surveillance contexts, occupational members construct not just positively valenced desired identities but also negatively valenced feared identities, and how feared identities are antagonistic foils to desired ones that enhance their appeal. Second, we analyse how self‐discipline is exerted through dual processes of self‐examination: prideful talk that affirms desired identities and guilt‐ridden talk which casts doubt on their attainment and spurs auto‐correction. Third, we demonstrate how conformist identity work which (re)produces occupational identities through desire and fear reduces people's scope for resistance. This research highlights identity work that is non‐supportive of the (desired) self and how an appreciation of feared in addition to desired identities is vital to understand fully the tensional nature of occupational selves.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a novel data set of realized syndicated loan cash flows and a risk‐adjustment methodology adapted from the private equity literature, I provide a measure of risk‐adjusted returns for bank loan cash flows. Banks, on average, generate 180 basis points in gross risk‐adjusted returns and add $75 million of value annually to their loan portfolios. Banks earn higher returns when they lend to financially constrained borrowers, and the risk‐adjusted performance of bank loan portfolios exhibits persistence. However, banks require higher risk‐adjusted returns when facing their own financing frictions, and shareholders earn nearly zero net risk‐adjusted returns once bank staff are compensated for their lending effort. Overall, these findings suggest that banks provide valuable services to mitigate borrowers' financing frictions, and the present value of loan cash flows pays for the costs of providing these services.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We build an arbitrage‐based model of the yield curves in a heterogeneous monetary union with sovereign default risk, which accounts for the asymmetric shifts in euro‐area yields during the Covid‐19 pandemic. We derive an affine term structure solution, and decompose yields into expectations, term premium, expected default loss, and credit risk premium components. In an extension, we endogenize the peripheral default probability, showing that it decreases with central bank bond holdings. Calibrating the model to Germany and Italy, we show that both the level and the shifts in the sovereign spread are mainly attributable to the credit risk premium.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Extant studies suggest that a particular set of means, once in place, prompt entrepreneurs to enact effectual decision‐making. However, little is known about how such effectual means are developed, particularly when entrepreneurs' primary means are digital capital rather than pre‐existing effectual means. To address this gap, our qualitative research examines an emerging phenomenon in which young people engage in side‐hustling through social media. Our findings reveal that entrepreneurs develop effectual means by leveraging digital capital through browsing, consulting, and imitating. This developmental process is significantly streamlined by digital capital's generativity, recommendability, and multimodality, with its cost‐effectiveness dynamically assessed to determine the continuity of development. Drawing on these findings, we discuss implications for effectuation theory and entrepreneurship studies.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs are known to rely on their established means for effectual decision‐making. However, little is known about how entrepreneurs make effectual decisions when they possess digital capital but have underdeveloped means for effectuation. This study explores how young side‐hustlers on social media build means for effectuation through browsing, consulting, and imitating. The generativity, recommendability, and multimodality of digital capital significantly enhance this developmental process, while cost‐effectiveness is continuously assessed to determine whether to proceed. We develop a process model that illustrates how entrepreneurs leverage and optimize digital capital to drive effectuation in the digital age.</content>

    <title>Integrating multimodal data and machine learning for entrepreneurship research</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Extant research in neuroscience suggests that human perception is multimodal in nature—we model the world integrating diverse data sources such as sound, images, taste, and smell. Working in a dynamic environment, entrepreneurs are expected to draw on multimodal inputs in their decision making. However, extant research in entrepreneurship has largely focused on how entrepreneurs or investors develop insights from data in a single mode. A few studies that have used a multimodal approach either simplify the multimodal data (MMD) into a few constructs or manually analyze the data without fully utilizing their potential. Such oversimplification limits the insights that can be gained from MMD. In this paper, we offer a framework to guide researchers to analyze and integrate MMD, capturing various cues embedded in the entrepreneurial process. We illustrate how applying machine learning algorithms to MMD can engender a robust, reliable, and scalable approach for researchers to effectively capture the elusive yet critical aspects of entrepreneurial phenomena. We also curate a set of data and algorithm resources for researchers interested in leveraging MMD in their studies.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs operate in fast‐paced and complex environments where success often relies on the ability to make sense of diverse and rich information, which ranges from explicit observations (e.g., what they see and hear) to more subtle contextual cues. Yet, most entrepreneurship research focuses on analyzing data in a single mode, such as only texts or numbers. Our research highlights the importance of embracing multimodal data (MMD) that combines various formats like audio, image, video, and text, to better understand and explain entrepreneurial decision‐making. We introduce a practical framework and a set of machine learning techniques that help managers and researchers alike harness the richness of multimodal data. Rather than simplifying or manually analyzing multimodal data, our approach allows for scalable, systematic, and reliable insights into the entrepreneurial process. For practitioners, this means better tools for evaluating pitches, tracking team dynamics, or sensing market trends in real time. To support adoption, we also provide a curated set ofMMDsources and algorithms that organizations can leverage to make more informed strategic decisions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study the impact of industrial policies on industrial development by considering an important episode during the East Asian miracle: South Korea’s heavy and chemical industry (HCI) drive, 1973–1979. Based on newly assembled data, I use the introduction and termination of industrial policies to study their impacts during and after the intervention period. (1) I reveal that heavy-chemical industrial policies promoted the expansion and dynamic comparative advantage of directly targeted industries. (2) Using variation in exposure to policies through the input-output network, I demonstrate that the policy indirectly benefited downstream users of targeted intermediates. (3) The benefits of HCI persisted even after the policy ended, as some results were slower to appear. The findings suggest that the temporary drive shifted Korean manufacturing into more advanced markets and supported durable change. This study helps clarify the lessons drawn from the East Asian growth miracle.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of an innovative police patrol program on sexual harassment in public spaces in Hyderabad, India. In collaboration with the Hyderabad City Police, we randomize exposure to police patrols and the visibility of officers by deploying both uniformed and undercover officers across 350 hotspots. To assess the effect, we implement a novel, high-frequency observation exercise to measure sexual harassment at these hotspots, where enumerators recorded all observed instances of sexual harassment and women’s responses in real time. We find that although police patrols had no impact on overall street harassment, uniformed police patrols reduced severe forms of harassment (forceful touching, intimidation) by 27 percent and reduced the likelihood of women leaving the hotspot due to sexual harassment. We uncovered the underlying mechanisms and found that both police visibility and officers’ attitudes toward sexual harassment are key to understanding its incidence.</content>

    <title>The Impact of Bank Financing on Borrowers’ Voluntary Disclosures and Real Investments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how an increase in bank lending affects firms’ investment disclosures and policies. Exploiting the unconventional liquidity injections by the European Central Bank in 2011–2012, we find that U.S. borrowers of European Union (EU) banks receive greater bank financing and issue more management capital expenditure (capex) forecasts following the liquidity injections. In contrast, we find no evidence of changes in bond financing or issuance of management earnings forecasts. We also find that EU banks’ U.S. borrowers on average receive negative market reactions to their capex forecasts and make no change in investment following the liquidity injection. Further, relative to firms with positive feedback, firms with negative feedback have a lower increase in investment but a higher increase in financial assets. Additionally, we find that the effect of increased bank lending on management capex forecasts is more pronounced among banks with weaker financial conditions and among borrowers with greater financial constraints, higher growth volatility, and more informed trading. These findings highlight the important role of capex forecasts in seeking market feedback following increased bank lending and suggest that market feedback helps explain why the transmission of bank credit to corporate investment did not occur following the liquidity injections.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00528 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In view of the significant role project success plays for all parties in the crowdfunding market, a wealth of research has extensively explored its vastly diverse antecedents. Drawing on the elaboration likelihood model as an overarching theoretical basis, our meta-analysis examines the aggregated effects of widely investigated antecedents (as central and peripheral cues) and moderating roles of research contexts (referring to the elaboration likelihood). It reveals a stronger link with soft information–related factors, weaker ties with backer-related factors, and varied effects of project factors. Crowdfunding success measure, crowdfunding model, platform popularity, and project location are important reasons for the inconsistencies in findings across individual studies. Our research offers valuable insights for stakeholders in the crowdfunding ecosystem. For backers, it empowers them to select projects with greater potential for success among the vast number of available options, ensuring more informed investment decisions. Fundraisers can leverage our findings to refine their fundraising strategies, thereby boosting their chances of securing funds effectively. Crowdfunding platforms can harness our findings to refine their system architecture, enrich service offerings, and improve user satisfaction. Furthermore, regulators and policymakers can draw from our study to devise regulations that nurture a robust and favorable crowdfunding environment.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Information Sharing and Contracting between Competing Manufacturers and Common Retailer</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study information sharing contracts in which a privately informed retailer offers to share its demand information with the upstream competing manufacturers (suppliers) for a price. We investigate whether such information sharing contracts would ever be accepted by the manufacturers, especially when they can use alternative means, like screening contracts, to obtain the same information. For that we model a 3-stage game between the retailer and the manufacturers in which the retailer first determines the optimal payment, per manufacturer, for sharing its demand information. Consequently, the manufacturers simultaneously accept or reject this offer in stage 2. In stage 3, both manufacturers simultaneously offer menus of payment-quantity contracts to the retailer, which act as screening contracts if the manufacturer(s) rejected information sharing contract previously. We fully characterize stage-3 contracts under common agency; the manufacturers’ stage-2 equilibrium; and the retailer’s stage-1 decision. We find that common agency can augment the reduction in competition intensity between the manufacturers. As a result, a manufacturer using screening can do better than a manufacturer accepting information-sharing even when information is free, which implies that both manufacturers might never choose information sharing in a pure strategy equilibrium for a positive information sharing price. Despite this, we find that the retailer will optimally set an information sharing price that results in both manufacturers either accepting information sharing as long as demand uncertainty is not too low, or always accepting information sharing, and that the manufacturers can end up in a prisoner’s dilemma. Managerially, our findings provide guidance to both manufacturers as well as retailers on their decisions pertaining to information sharing contracts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In "Robust Actionable Prescriptive Analytics," Chen et al. present a significant advancement in prescriptive analytics. The authors propose a novel robust prescriptive analytics framework that bridges data-driven decision making and actionable policy optimization. Unlike traditional approaches that follow a “predict, then optimize” methodology, this framework directly maps side information to optimized decisions, ensuring both interpretability and implementability. Leveraging a robust satisficing approach, the model effectively mitigates overfitting to empirical data while maintaining computational tractability. The authors also introduce tree-based static and affine policies for enhanced interpretability, and they demonstrate the framework’s practical value through a portfolio optimization case study. This innovative approach provides a powerful tool for decision makers seeking robust, data-driven policies across various operational contexts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managerial decision makers are increasingly supported by advanced data analytics and other artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies, but they are often found to be hesitant to follow the algorithmic advice. We examine how compensation contract design and framing of an AI algorithm influence decision makers’ reliance on algorithmic advice and performance in a price estimation task. Based on a large sample of almost 1,500 participants, we find that compared with a fixed compensation, both compensation contracts based on individual performance and tournament contracts lead to an increase in effort duration and to more reliance on algorithmic advice. We further find that using an AI algorithm that is framed as also incorporating human expertise has positive effects on advice utilization, especially for decision makers with fixed pay contracts. By showing how widely used control practices, such as incentives and task framing, influence the interaction of human decision makers with AI algorithms, our findings have direct implications for managerial practice.This paper has been accepted by David Simchi-Levi for the Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02777 .</content>

    <title>Discrete Choice via Sequential Search</title>

      <name>Natalia Kosilova, Aydın Alptekinoğlu</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Essentially every choice involves an information collection or search phase prior to a decision-making phase that culminates in a choice. To study the information collection phase within an important class of search problems and understand how it influences the final choice, we embed an analytically tractable discrete choice model in a classical model of sequential search with perfect recall. Although significant progress has been made in the theory literature in analyzing consumers’ discrete choice behavior using random utility models, discrete choice through a sequential search process has not received enough attention at least in part because of analytical intractability issues. We build on the seminal Pandora’s Problem as a model of sequential search with perfect recall and on Exponomial Choice as a model of discrete choice (with each choice specified by a deterministic or observable utility component minus a random or unobservable utility component following an exponential distribution). We derive the search path and final choice probabilities in closed form, develop all the analytical tools to optimize prices for a given assortment of products, and show that the optimal assortment must contain some number of highest-value products at optimal prices. These results enable joint optimization of assortment and prices efficiently. The structure of the solution features a distinct group of products that are priced just so they remain on the search path with higher probability. Through simulation studies, allowing us to control the ground truth, we also show that our model is competitive against the state of the art in empirical modeling of sequential search and that ignoring sequential search distorts both optimal variety and pricing decisions in an upward direction.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01552 .</content>

    <title>How the Design of Ranking Systems and Ability Affects Physician Effort</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although relative performance feedback in the form of rankings appears to be effective in improving health outcomes, it may have either motivating or demotivating effects for individual physicians. Potential factors influencing such effects include a physician’s ability and the design of the ranking system itself; however, there is limited understanding of these factors. Using a controlled lab-in-the-field experiment with practicing and future physicians as subjects ([Formula: see text]), we systematically analyze effort within small teams under different ranking systems. Exogenously varying the number and position of the thresholds defining the ranking system, we observe that the addition of a threshold to create a new rank is motivating—that is, increases effort—only among individuals capable of exceeding that threshold; the effort of other individuals may remain unchanged or even decrease. In particular, a highly granular ranking system with ranks spanning the entire range of possible outcomes maximizes overall physician effort; high thresholds serve to motivate high-ability individuals, whereas moderate and low thresholds provide opportunities for improvement to lower-ability individuals who cannot reach the high thresholds. Our results suggest that, to motivate their teams effectively, clinical leaders should provide rank feedback using a system under which physicians of all ability types can improve their rank through increased effort.This paper was accepted by Stefan Scholtes, healthcare management department.Funding: This work was supported by C-SEB Center for Social and Economic Behavior at the University of Cologne (Junior Startup Grant No: Rd04-2016-JSUG-Huesmann) and the School of Business and Economics at the University of Münster (Junior Researcher Promotion Fund).

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Policy shocks that increase the costs of public goods should simultaneously reduce voter support for them. We study the extent to which this creates a corresponding voter-induced municipal credit risk. We exploit changes to state and local tax (SALT) deductions from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act as a policy shock to the costs of local public goods. In a difference-in-differences framework with repeated bond trades, we find that jurisdictions with a higher share of residents who ceased deducting SALT (and therefore, face a higher marginal cost of local public goods) experienced a significant increase in municipal bond yields, with an average treatment effect of 8.3 basis points or 3.0% of the unconditional average yield spread. This effect is concentrated in areas where residents have a direct impact on municipal financing decisions via ballot initiatives. This study thus demonstrates the importance of voters in the pricing of public debt and extends the discussion of political and policy uncertainty and therefore, coordination and agency problems to the municipal context.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06072 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores whether investors’ personal experience with climate change affects their voting behavior on climate change–related proposals. We find that fund managers exposed to abnormally hot temperatures are significantly more likely to support climate proposals. We further show that the effect is persistent. We observe significant heterogeneity in the effect of hot temperatures, depending on firm-level climate risk, the quality of the proposals, fund investment strategy, and prior awareness of climate change. Fund managers’ personal experience with climate change matters for the outcome of climate proposals as it affects the aggregate support they receive. Fund managers exposed to abnormally hot temperatures are also more likely to divest from stocks with greater exposure to climate change.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: R.

    <title>EXPRESS: How Can a Firm Suppress Shareholders’ Punitive Reaction to Its Disengagement from a Geopolitically Uncertain Market?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Increased geopolitical tensions have raised firms’ uncertainty about some geographical markets; in response, firms may announce their disengagement from these markets. Such announcements may lower the firm’s future revenue and thus elicit negative reactions from shareholders. The authors theorize managers can frame announcements to impress shareholders and suppress their punitive reactions. Specifically, in the context of firms’ announcements of disengagement from Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, the authors show that an announcement’s market emphasis (i.e., mentions of product-market activities and stakeholders) is positively related to the shareholders’ reaction. Further, the announcement’s social emphasis (i.e., mentions of employees, environment, and community) and a delay in announcing the disengagement weakens the market emphasis’s positive association with shareholder reactions. This research highlights that linguistic framing in disengagement announcements can shape shareholders’ reactions to such announcements.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The global food system has a large impact on the environment. By converting household grocery purchases into environmental cost factors like greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use, this study examines the sustainability of food purchases over a 10-year period using household panel data in two pro-sustainability markets (Germany and the Netherlands). The environmental intensity of households’ grocery baskets has not declined over time in these countries. Even though younger and more educated households are starting to shift their diets, the share of plant-based alternatives in food diets remains very low. The authors propose that one contributing factor is a lack of environmental knowledge, which they address by developing an app that gives personalized feedback on the emissions associated with consumers’ food purchases. The app also allows users to create sustainable grocery bundles aligned with their dietary preferences. Two experiments demonstrate that interacting with the app (1) raises subjective and objective environmental knowledge related to food, with much of this improvement persisting for over six months, and (2) reduces GHG emissions associated with stated food choices by up to 33%. These reductions are driven by different information formats within the app, including peer-comparisons and detailed information about food-category emissions.</content>

    <title>The Strength of Showing Weakness: Organizational Supplication and Investor Reactions to Workforce Downsizing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Strategy research usually assumes that displays of weakness are disadvantageous for firms. In this study, we challenge this assumption. We propose that deliberate displays of weakness can help firms preserve stakeholder approval when taking controversial decisions. To test this proposition, we examine the use and effectiveness of organizational supplication in the context of workforce downsizing. Building on impression management theory, we predict that firms portray themselves as weak through downward earnings management before workforce downsizing announcements, and that this supplication tactic helps attenuate investors’ negative reactions. Moreover, we posit that supplication paired with an efficiency-focused verbal justification for the downsizing is particularly effective at attenuating negative investor reactions to downsizing announcements, as an additional verbal justification lends authenticity to the downsizing firm’s supplication attempt. Yet, we also theorize that organizational supplication through downward earnings management is less effective if positive firm evaluations by security analysts and the business media make it appear inauthentic. The empirical analysis of nearly 600 workforce downsizing announcements by the largest listed U.S. firms between 2001 and 2020 supports our theoretical predictions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Privatization of state‐owned enterprises is on the agenda across the globe. Using Swedish data covering two decades, we show that productivity gains and headcount reductions are associated with economic costs for incumbent workers. Workers experience income losses and higher unemployment, but half of the losses are covered by the social safety net. We also find small positive effects on entrepreneurship and cash holdings but no meaningful effects on other labor market, family, health, or household finance outcomes. Productivity improves when the CEO is replaced, and the gains outweigh workers' income declines by a factor of between two and six.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over‐the‐counter (OTC) trading thrives despite competition from exchanges. We let OTC dealers cream skim from exchanges in an otherwise standard Glosten and Milgrom framework. Restricting the dealer's ability to cream skim induces “cheap substitution”: some traders exit while others with larger gains from trade enter. Cheap substitution implies trading costs, trade volumes, and market shares are poor policy indicators. In a benchmark case, restricting the dealer raises welfare only if trading cost increases, volume falls, and OTC market share is high. By contrast, the restriction improves welfare when adverse selection risk is low. A simple procedure implements the optimal Pigouvian tax.</content>

    <title>Advancing Next-Generation Multimethod Research in Information Systems: A Framework and Some Recommendations for Authors and Evaluators</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The increasing complexity of sociotechnical phenomena, proliferation of diverse data sources, expanding repertoire of research methods, and broadening multiparadigmatic awareness and competence have spurred a growing interest in multimethod research in the information systems (IS) field. This editorial recognizes and celebrates the value of integrating diverse methods and offers a framework to classify multimethod research using two dimensions: (a) methodological distance—the degree of difference (proximate or distant) between methods employed in terms of characteristics such as paradigmatic assumptions, techniques, and goals; and (b) nature of integration—the extent to which the methods are combined in loosely coupled (interlayered) or tightly coupled (intertwined) ways. These dimensions yield four types of multimethod research: assembly (proximate methods with interlayered integration), blend (proximate methods with intertwined integration), bridge (distant methods with interlayered integration), and fusion (distant methods with intertwined integration). We illustrate each archetype with studies published in leading IS journals. Building on these examples, we provide actionable guidance for authors on conducting and presenting multimethod research and also offer recommendations for evaluators of multimethod work. More broadly, we call on the IS community to embrace multimethod research not as an ad hoc stack of methods, but as a systematic strategy, aligning with these recommendations related to methodological distance and nature of integration, to produce a credible, revelatory, and rich body of knowledge on multifaceted IS phenomena.</content>

    <title>Employee Digital Transformation Experience Towards Automation Versus Augmentation: Implications for Job Attitudes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As a growing number of organizations are leveraging emerging technologies to optimize their operations to stay competitive, digital transformation has fast become an integral part of employee experience at the intersection of their psychological states and the workplace. However, employee experience with digital transformation is heterogeneous given the different approaches organizations take toward this initiative. We hence simultaneously consider both the nature of the digital transformation (i.e., automation versus augmentation) and the presence versus absence of employee voice mechanisms. Drawing from psychological reactance theory, we argue that employee experience of automation‐driven transformation will be more likely to engender psychological reactance, which in turn impacts important employee job attitudes, represented by job satisfaction, employment security, and turnover intention. We also argue that employee voice moderates this mediated relationship. Using data from two studies with different samples and research designs (an experimental design in Study 1 and a field survey in Study 2), the findings support our hypothesized relationships. The two‐study approach helps to enhance the validity of the research and demonstrate the generalizability of findings, thereby strengthening our contributions to the literature. Overall, the studies theoretically extend understandings of how employees respond to digital transformation by offering new insights into the psychological reactance mechanism. We also provide practical implications for business and practitioners seeking to manage digital transformation in ways that enhance desired employee job attitudes.</content>

    <title>From Strategic &lt;scp&gt;HRM&lt;/scp&gt; to Sustainable &lt;scp&gt;HRM&lt;/scp&gt;? Exploring a Common Good Approach Through a Critical Reflection on Existing Literature</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The emergence of sustainability discourse has provided new avenues and momentum for human resource management (HRM) scholars to extend existing lines of enquiry and to generate new ones. This has led to a surge of research interest in sustainability in the last decade, not least as a response to the growing environmental concerns and, more recently, to the Sustainable Development Goals launched by the United Nations in 2015. The rapidly emerging body of research is accompanied by confusion and critiques regarding what sustainable HRM entails, how it can be measured, and who may benefit. This perspective paper discusses these issues by focusing on common good HRM as the latest variant of sustainable HRM and identifies challenges as well as opportunities for research. It draws on stakeholder theory, legitimacy theory, cultural perspective, and HR ecosystem theory to illustrate how future studies can advance our knowledge of common good HRM by building on the existing strong body of HRM scholarship and embracing a broader range of stakeholders, epistemological perspectives, and methodological approaches.</content>

    <title>The cousin marriage tradition, colonial shocks, and the performance of informal firms in sub‐Saharan Africa</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper explores how the deep historical roots of informal institutions influence current informal businesses. It proposes that both pre‐colonial institutions—the tradition of cousin marriage—and the subsequent shocks of colonization still impact the performance of informal firms. We theorize on how the effects of historical family systems are moderated by the traumatic and spatially heterogeneous shocks of colonialism, in particular the cultural values of the colonizers (individualism) and their religious (missionary) activities. Our hypotheses are tested by regression analysis based on surveys of informal businesses in multiple regions of eight African countries. We find that the cousin marriage tradition is negatively associated with the performance of current informal businesses though this relationship is attenuated in places where colonizers were more individualistic.Managerial SummaryThis paper explores how the pre‐colonial family institutions—the tradition of cousin marriage—and the subsequent shocks of colonization jointly impact the performance of contemporary informal firms in sub‐Saharan Africa. We propose that the historical tradition of cousin marriage has persistent and negative effects on the revenue and labor productivity of contemporary informal businesses. This is because informal entrepreneurs in ethnic areas with the cousin marriage tradition may prioritize social obligations over economic incentives. However, these relationships are attenuated in ethnic areas colonized by European countries with more individualistic cultural values. Our findings highlight the importance for business owners and managers to understand the deep historical roots of the social norms of the communities and groups with which they interact.</content>

    <title>Rationing Scarce Healthcare Capacity: A Study of the Ventilator Allocation Guidelines During the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the United States, even though national guidelines for allocating scarce healthcare resources are lacking, 26 states have specific ventilator allocation guidelines to be invoked in case of a shortage. While several states developed their guidelines in response to the recent COVID‐19 pandemic, New York State developed these guidelines in 2015 as “pandemic influenza is a foreseeable threat, one that we cannot ignore.” The primary objective of this study is to assess the existing procedures and priority rules in place for allocating/rationing scarce ventilator capacity and propose alternative (and improved) priority schemes. We first build machine learning models using inpatient records of COVID‐19 patients admitted to New York‐Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center and an affiliated community health center to predict survival probabilities as well as ventilator length‐of‐use. Then, we use the resulting point estimators and their uncertainties as inputs for a multiclass priority queueing model with abandonments to assess three priority schemes: (i) SOFA‐P (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment based prioritization), which most closely mimics the existing practice by prioritizing patients with sufficiently low SOFA scores; (ii) ISP (incremental survival probability), which assigns priority based on patient‐level survival predictions; and (iii) ISP‐LU (incremental survival probability per length‐of‐use), which takes into account survival predictions and resource use duration. Our findings highlight that our proposed priority scheme, ISP‐LU, achieves a demonstrable improvement over the other two alternatives. Specifically, the expected number of survivals increasesanddeath risk while waiting for ventilator use decreases. We also show that ISP‐LU is a robust priority scheme whose implementation yields a Pareto‐improvement over both SOFA‐P and ISP in terms of maximizing saved lives after mechanical ventilation while limiting racial disparity in access to the priority queue.</content>

    <title>Impact of Self‐Service Technology in Designing a Service Delivery System</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Self‐service technologies (SSTs) have been widely adopted in industries that require the delivery of physical products by services, in which consumers evaluate a product for both the product value and the service value. A typical service delivery system usually involves sales agents and/or self‐service technologies, for example, online services and kiosks, to serve consumers by a coproduction process. In other words, both the sales agent (or self‐service machine) and the consumer should exert effort, with corresponding service costs. By modeling the coproduction output with a Cobb–Douglas production function, we establish a principal–agent model to study the value of self‐service technologies in designing a service delivery system wherein the sales agent's service cost is private information. We first characterize the main trade‐off between the sales agent and the self‐service machine when the firm provides only one service channel. Then, we analyze the value of the self‐service machine when the firm can provide both service channels. We find that, interestingly, the firm may possibly provide both service channels, that is, services offered by the sales agent and the self‐service machine, when the level of information uncertainty is high, and the self‐service machine's service cost is intermediate. Moreover, when both service channels are offered, only the efficient sales agent will be contracted, and the inefficient sales agents are screened out of the market by the self‐service machine; that is, the self‐service machine can help the firm eliminate the information rent. We also investigate how the firm's service weight in the coproduction process and information uncertainty influence the consumer surplus, firm's choices, contract parameters, and resulting profits. Our results are shown to be robust when our model is extended to consider a single‐contract strategy, contracting on effort, a continuous sales agent type, and a general coproduction function.</content>

    <title>Are Employees Committed to Diversity at Work and in Their Personal Lives? The Role of Organizational Antiracist Signaling Following a Racial Injustice Event</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on corporate sociopolitical activism (CSA) is in its infancy, and more research is needed to examine its effects on employees. We draw from the tenets of Signaling Theory to develop and test a model of how organizations' antiracist signaling after a racial injustice event, as a form of CSA, communicates that racial justice is valued sincerely by organizations, and in turn, motivates employee commitment to diversity—both at work and in their personal lives. We also explore boundary conditions (i.e., climate for inclusion, employee race) of this relationship. We test our model with data collected from 367 employees (37.6% Black, 62.4% White) across 4‐time waves, each 1 month apart, using a mixed‐methods (quantitative and qualitative) approach. Results suggest that organizations are viewed as most sincere when they engage in signaling that includes both words (i.e., releasing a statement) and actions (e.g., hiring a diversity officer) relative to when they don't engage in these words and/or actions. Moreover, when organizations signaled a sincere commitment to antiracism with both words and actions, employees were more committed to diversity at work and in their personal lives, though actions taken by the organization were especially important. Moreover, a strong climate for inclusion reduced the need for actions, while a weak climate for inclusion increased the need for a statement. Theoretical, research, and practical implications are discussed.</content>

    <title>Quiet Quitting in Times of Uncertainty: Definition and Relationship With Perceived Control</title>
    <updated>2025-06-04T13:48:44+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Uncertain times—such as periods of political turmoil, economic instability, health, or climate crises—can diminish individuals' perception of control over their environment. This paper hypothesizes that reduced perceptions of control may impact how individuals relate to their work, specifically, triggering quiet quitting, where employees intentionally refrain from tasks beyond their job requirements. Evidence supports this hypothesis: for example, the phenomenon of quiet quitting has resurged in the post‐pandemic era, coinciding with a significant decline in workers' perceived control around that time. However, no research has yet explored the relationship between perceived control and quiet quitting. Drawing on motivation theory, this paper posits that workers' perceived control, reflected in their beliefs about the effort‐reward link, can explain quiet quitting. To test this, we conducted two extensive online surveys with two main objectives: first, to conceptually refine and operationalize the construct of quiet quitting with a 5‐item scale; second, to examine the relationship between perceived control and quiet quitting. Our findings reveal a significant negative association between workers' perceived control and their propensity to engage in quiet quitting. This relationship is partially mediated by a reduced affective commitment to the employer and an elevated sense of replaceability. A direct implication of our results is that initiatives aimed at restoring workers' sense of agency at work might reduce quiet quitting behaviors.</content>

    <title>Popularity Feedback and Adaptation Strategies in Online Dating: A Social Comparison Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digital platforms are increasingly employing informational nudges to motivate user participation. This paper examines the provision of popularity information as a feedback mechanism and its impact on users’ adaptation strategies. Leveraging ego utility theory and self-determination theory, we hypothesize that comparative popularity information—information that facilitates social comparison—will trigger different reactions based on gender and popularity level. In collaboration with an online dating service provider, we designed and conducted two randomized field experiments in which we provided popularity feedback to platform users and investigated their post-feedback behavioral changes in two adaptation strategies: the selectiveness in choosing potential partners (i.e., selectivity calibration) and the frequency of their online profile modifications (i.e., self-marketing). In the first experiment, where we revealed information about their popularity relative to other users, we found that those who received low-popularity feedback significantly increased self-marketing efforts and lowered their selectivity, but the opposite was observed in individuals who received high-popularity feedback. We also found that men readily made adaptations to their selectivity calibration and self-marketing, whereas women’s behaviors were more persistent as they exhibited little strategic change. We then conducted a second experiment in which we revealed absolute popularity instead of comparative popularity and observed no significant changes in adaptation strategies. Comparing the outcomes of the two experiments, we argue that it is the social comparison information associated with comparative popularity that drives user behavioral changes.</content>

    <title>Design Principles for Information Categorization Quality in Crowdsourced Crisis Mapping Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crisis mapping platforms have transformed disaster management and digital humanitarian efforts by allowing victims to quickly submit “Requests for Help” (RFH) messages directly from disaster locations via mobile devices. On these platforms, online volunteers are often engaged in processing and categorizing messy and incomplete RFH messages into structured and useful crisis reports that can aid first responders in their recovery efforts. This research note examines the case of the Ushahidi platform deployed during the 2010 Haiti Earthquake to propose design principles for a crisis mapping platform that facilitates the conversion and categorization of victim-submitted RFH messages into actionable crisis reports for on-site first responders. To validate the proposed design principles, we instantiated them with the help of a template, and conducted a series of experiments to confirm the effectiveness of the template in improving the categorization quality of crisis reports. We expect that the design principles will be particularly useful for developing digital platforms aimed at humanitarian crisis response that requires a large-scale participation of online crowd volunteers.</content>

    <title>Privacy Concerns and Data Donations: Do Societal Benefits Matter?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Data donations, where individuals are encouraged to donate their personal information, have the potential to advance medical research and help limit the spread of pandemics, among other benefits. The decision to donate data is fundamentally a privacy decision. In this research, we build on the privacy calculus, a model describing privacy risks and benefits, and examine the impact of privacy concerns on data donation decisions, highlighting the role of societal benefits in privacy decisions. Based on two randomized experiments using the general context of data donation for medical research (Experiment 1) and the specific context of data donation for COVID-19 research (Experiment 2), we find that individuals who are highly concerned about privacy tend to donate less data (Experiments 1 and 2). This effect holds under a variety of conditions and is consistent with prevailing research. However, this effect is contingent on the privacy calculus. When implicit or explicit societal benefits are perceived, particularly in the absence of privacy controls, the association between privacy concerns and data donation decisions is less salient, highlighting the significant role that societal benefits play in privacy decisions. We discuss the theoretical, practical, social, and ethical implications of these findings.</content>

    <title>How Artifact-Based and Authority-Based Coordination Affect Propagation Costs in Open Source Software Development</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The success of open source software (OSS) projects depends on their ability to produce software architectures with low propagation costs, as such architectures demand little effort from developers. This study focuses on the project’s form of coordination—the way in which interdependent contributions are managed—as a driving force behind propagation costs. It distinguishes between two coordination archetypes. First, artifact-based coordination is found in egalitarian projects, in which developers only use the work artifact (the architecture itself), without direct interaction, to coordinate. Second, authority-based coordination is used in hierarchical projects (e.g., Linux Kernel) or when companies pay developers for their work. Using a computational model, this study compares these two coordination mechanisms by simulating how they build software architectures (formalized as design structure matrices) from interdependent contributions. As a contextual condition, the model considers the degree of architecture visibility, which is the developers’ (in)ability to see recent additions to the architecture. The model provides two insights. First, artifact-based coordination, as compared to authority-based coordination, generally leads to lower propagation costs. Second, decreasing the degree of architecture visibility reduces propagation costs, an effect that I describe as focal-layered superposition. These insights contribute to the literatures on coordination in OSS development and the mirroring hypothesis. They also have practical implications for the creation of preferable architectures in OSS development.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While a large body of information systems (IS) literature has investigated the antecedents and consequences of data breaches in organizations, we do not have a good understanding of whether a data breach has a material impact on individuals whose private information is compromised and how much damage it causes. We overcome empirical challenges in investigating the impact of data breaches on individual victims by utilizing a unique natural experimental setting that allows us to credibly identify treated and controlled populations—the breach of South Carolina (SC) taxpayer records in 2012. With residents in SC as the treatment group and those in Georgia and North Carolina as the control group, our difference-in-differences estimations find that after the breach at the SC Department of Revenue, there was a significant increase in denials to SC residents’ residential mortgage applications for refinance and home improvement. We also find that the adverse impact of the breach was more profound for Black and Hispanic residents. Our study provides significant theoretical and policy implications with respect to the harm and costs of a large-scale data breach.</content>

    <title>The Hidden Cost of IT Innovation: Access to Emerging Technologies and the Gender Wage Gap</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although an extensive information systems literature has explored the economic benefits of information technology (IT) investments, how these benefits are distributed between male and female IT workers has not been as closely examined. This paper bridges this gap by addressing two questions: (1) Do women and men have similar opportunities to acquire skills related to new IT innovations? (2) How do these differences affect the gender pay gap? We argue that women are underrepresented in roles that use emerging technologies due to two interrelated processes: demand-side labor market conditions and supply-side job sorting. By analyzing two independent datasets that provide insights into wages, career trajectories, and skill prerequisites for IT roles, we found that women are less likely to apply for jobs requiring expertise with emerging technologies. Such positions often require extended work hours, frequent job mobility, and geographic relocation—which can conflict with the family responsibilities typically assumed by women. Yet because these positions tend to offer higher wages, women’s underrepresentation in these roles exacerbates the gender pay gap in the IT sector. Our findings stress the importance of creating more flexible job structures and enhancing women’s access to emerging technology roles as critical for achieving gender equity in the IT industry.</content>

    <title>Defending Your Own or Trolling the Haters: A Configurational Approach to Incivility in Online Communities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study explores the emergence of incivility in online communities, challenging the traditional perspective that attributes incivility to individual elements of sociotechnical systems. We argue that this narrow focus fails to recognize the complex interactions between these elements, leading to a rudimentary understanding of how incivility originates and evolves. To address this gap, our research employed fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), examining approximately 4.3 million posts from 100 diverse online communities on Reddit. Through this analysis, we identified five distinct paths that converged into two primary community configurations: close-knit and scattered communities. Each configuration exhibits unique affordances whose activation fosters incivility in different ways. Based on these findings, we expand the understanding of incivility to include subtle, indirect behaviors beyond overt forms such as trolling or hate speech and show how the interplay of multiple community elements produces affordances, avoiding the narrow view of individual affordances and shedding light on variations of social systems. Finally, we demonstrate that within the same digital platform, different social systems can impact user behaviors, including incivility.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online games are one of the most popular information systems in the world, with over 2 billion users worldwide. Most users follow the social norms and standards of behavior in online games, but some violate social norms, negatively affecting others’ gameplay experiences and weakening loyalty to the game. The social norms in games and other online environments often differ from the social norms in the real world, so are users who violate norms doing so deliberately or are they unaware of the norms? Our results suggest that many users violate social norms because they do not understand them—about a third of the 1,093 participants in our study reported being unsure of the social norms in an online game they played regularly. Greater experience with a game did not significantly increase social norm awareness. Instead, perceptions of social presence, and learning routines (i.e., community learning and instructional support) influenced social norm awareness, which in turn influenced norm compliance. Thus, a technology’s social affordances, social presence, and learning routines are more important than experience using a technology for helping users become aware of and comply with social norms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we study whether and how behavior toward newcomers impacts their socialization outcomes in terms of retention and the quality of contributions in online communities. By exploiting a natural experiment on a large deal-sharing platform, we found that an intervention that proactively reminds other community members to be more considerate of newcomers caused newcomer deals to receive 54% more comments and increased the positive sentiment of the comments. The newcomers in the treatment group were 10% more likely than newcomers in the non-treatment group to post another deal, suggesting an increase in retention. However, we did not observe any effect of the intervention on the quality of subsequent contributions. Our evidence suggests that the intervention merely caused a temporary shock to newcomers’ first contributions but did not improve their learning or motivate greater effort in subsequent contributions. We draw implications on the design of socialization processes to help communities improve the retention and performance of newcomers.</content>

    <title>How Collaboration Technology Use Affects IT Project Team Creativity: Integrating Team Knowledge and Creative Synthesis Perspectives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Contemporary IT project teams engage in creative problem solving to address increasingly complex business problems, highlighting the need to promote IT project team creativity. Collaboration technologies are widely used in IT project teams, but little is known about what collaboration technology features can be used to improve IT project team creativity and what the underlying influencing mechanisms are. To address this important gap, the current study builds on the extended team knowledge framework to identify collaboration technology features and decodes their influencing mechanisms on IT project team creativity by drawing on the novel creative synthesis theory originating in the management literature to the IT project team context. We identify three sets of collaboration technology support features—awareness knowledge supports, long-term knowledge supports, and transitional knowledge supports—and posit that their use can improve IT project team creativity by facilitating the creative synthesis process, which includes the three subconstructs of collective attention, similarity building, and enacting ideas. The research model is supported in general by empirical data collected through a multisourced survey of over 500 team members and their leaders from 62 IT project teams. We conclude with a discussion of theoretical and practical implications.</content>

    <title>Advancing Understanding of Scaling Health Information Infrastructures: Learning from EHR Initiatives in England</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many countries are developing health information infrastructures (HII) such as integrated electronic health records (EHRs) as a means of improving healthcare efficiency and effectiveness. However, efforts to build and scale up HII are fraught with challenges, as exemplified by the well-known case of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. In particular, HII scaling initiatives give rise to tensions, such as across geographical boundaries of EHRs, which are often not effectively addressed in practice. At the same time, there have been calls for research on scaling IS through a practice perspective, which adds to the existing categorical analysis of scale. Thus motivated, we aim to conceptualize the scaling of HII, focusing on the tensions between scales, the practices to accomplish scaling, and their consequences for scaling outcomes. To do so, we undertook a case study of recent NHS efforts to integrate EHRs in England, where we analyzed these scalar concepts and their interrelationships. Our study further develops the notion that scaling not only involves increasing the scale of IS but entails constructing and reconstructing scales. We also offer theoretical contributions by conceptualizing the range of scalar tensions and practices, their interplay, and their influences on HII scaling outcomes. Tensions that we identify as associated with different scale boundaries (organizational, spatial, and technological), extend those recognized in prior research. Furthermore, we uncover the scalar practices of joining and differentiating, adding to the governance and architectural approaches for HII scaling examined in past work. Through deepening the understanding of HII scaling, we generate insights for practitioners by highlighting scalar tensions and practices that could address the tensions under different conditions. Overall, we draw attention to scaling phenomena as being integral to the development of HII and introduce a new vocabulary for thinking about HII scaling.</content>

    <title>Emergence of IT Implementation Consequences in Organizations: An Assemblage Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ex nihilo nihil fit—nothing comes from nothing—fundamentally challenges IS scholars to explain how a new behavior may emerge and evolve into a recognizable practice from an organization’s IT implementation processes. Prior research addressing this problem has ascribed consequences to a preexisting macrolevel structure or microlevel interactions. We examined this issue by conceptualizing the emergence of IT implementation consequences as a multiphased process with analytically disaggregated phases. Using an assemblage lens, our theorizing draws on data from a multisite case study of body-worn camera technology implementation in three municipal police organizations in the U.S. We identified three emergence phases—individuation, composition, and actualization—and developed a process model theorizing a path from material and expressive components to IT implementation consequences through cascading properties and capacities. Our model shows that the emergence of IT implementation consequences is nonlinear and involves feedback loops across multiple phases. In some instances, IT implementation consequences may emerge via negative feedback loops involving tweaks and course correction before converging into recognizable new practices. In other instances, they may fail or convergence into recognizable practices may be delayed. We also show how combining existing components and assemblages results in nesting assemblages at successively larger scales. This allowed us to relativize the micro-macro relationship and explain both top-down and bottom-up emergence of IT implementation consequences.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We join the important effort of embracing diverse views on causality reflected in a prior MIS Quarterly Editor’s Comment (Mithas et al., 2022b). Specifically, we aim to expand the discussion around a major causal framework and toolkit that, we believe, is largely missing and needed in empirical studies in the field of information systems: that of causal diagrams and structural causal modeling (SCM). Being relatively new, the SCM framework has faced resistance from economists that has only recently begun to soften and, for this reason, remains largely absent in econometrics textbooks and in the curriculum of most information systems PhD programs. In contrast to viewpoints emphasizing the dichotomy between SCM and econometrics or potential outcomes approaches, we explain how SCM can serve as a complementary layer of identification and communication that aligns with such proven design and analysis frameworks. We discuss the current limitations of the SCM framework and opportunities for new research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To maintain elderly individuals’ ability to live independently in their own homes, technologies such as sensors and the internet of things can be used to facilitate real-time monitoring and automate emergency detection and alerts to enable first responders to deliver help on time. This study examines the design problems associated with such activity monitoring systems, particularly how to support the situational awareness of community first responders who are located remotely and do not have professional healthcare knowledge. Based on a three-year action design research study that investigated a sensor-based monitoring system for elderly people deployed in a natural community setting, we developed abstract design knowledge. Four design principles aimed at enhancing responders’ perceptions, comprehension, and projection of information are proposed to promote informed decision-making and timely responses by drawing on the situational awareness model. In addition to the nascent design knowledge regarding remote activity monitoring in different instances, this study extends our knowledge of the community-based model by foregrounding its multiplicity and the active roles of community stakeholders in providing care to elderly people.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online referral programs predominantly focus on incentivizing referrers to make referrals but largely ignore the potential of rewarding recipients to motivate referral behaviors. In this paper, we systematically examine whether, how, and when rewarding recipients could effectively motivate referrers with five experiments across a variety of settings. The results demonstrate that rewarding recipients is effective in motivating referrers to behave prosocially and make referrals. Interestingly, referrers behave prosocially when they are not rewarded, but the effectiveness of rewarding recipients is reduced if referrers are rewarded. We also reveal that referrers’ prosocial behaviors are primarily driven by altruistic motivation, rather than the pursuit of either reputational or collective benefits; notably, offering rewards to referrers dampens their altruistic motivation. Finally, we find that referrers’ prosocial behaviors are inhibited with an increased action cost of their referral behaviors, while their prosocial behaviors persist, even with an increased interpersonal cost associated with the referral behaviors. We conclude by offering theoretical and managerial implications for designing effective referral strategies that leverage the potential of rewarding recipients.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper reviews the main motivations and arguments of my work on comparative development, colonialism, and institutional change, which was often carried out jointly with James Robinson and Simon Johnson. I then provide a simple framework to organize these ideas and connect them with my research on innovation and technology. The framework is centered around a utility-technology possibilities frontier, which delineates the possible distributions of resources in a society both for given technology and working via different technological choices. It highlights how various types of institutions, market structures, norms, and ideologies influence moves along the frontier and shifts of the frontier, and it provides a simple formalization of the social forces that lead to institutional persistence and those that can trigger institutional change. The framework also enables us to conceptualize how, during periods of disruption, existing—and sometimes quite small—differences can have amplified effects on prosperity and institutional trajectories. In this way, it suggests some parallels between different disruptive periods, including the onset of European colonialism, the spread (or lack thereof) of industrial technologies in the nineteenth century, and decisions related to the use, adoption, and development of AI today.

To succeed, they must coordinate members’ views (consensus building) and actions (mobilization). We study union leaders within Myanmar’s burgeoning labor movement. Union leaders are positively selected on both ability and personality traits that enable them to influence others, yet they earn lower wages. In group discussions about workers’ views on an upcoming national minimum wage negotiation, randomly embedded leaders build consensus around the union’s preferred policy. In an experiment that mimics individual decision-making in a collective action setup, leaders increase mobilization through coordination. (JEL D91, J38, J51, O15)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online labor platforms for short-term remote work have many more job seekers than available jobs. Despite their relative abundance, workers capture a substantial share of the surplus from transactions. We draw this conclusion from demand estimates that imply workers’ wages include significant markups over costs and a survey that validates our surplus estimates. Workers retain a significant share of the surplus because demand-side search frictions and worker differentiation reduce direct competition. Finally, we show that applying traditional employment regulations to online gig economy platforms would lower job posting and hiring rates, reducing aggregate surplus for all market participants, including workers.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We construct a dataset of firms’ discount rates (i.e., required returns to capital) and perceived cost of capital using corporate conference calls. The relation between discount rates and the cost of capital is far below the one-to-one mapping assumed in standard theory, as it takes many years for changes in the cost of capital to be incorporated into discount rates. This pattern leads to large and time-varying discount rate wedges that affect firm investment. Moreover, increasing discount rate wedges can account for the recent puzzle of “missing investment.” Cross-firm variation in market power and riskiness explains the evolution of wedges.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Geographic dispersion of depositors, borrowers, and banks may prevent funding from flowing to high-loan-demand areas, limiting credit access. Using bank-county-year-level data, we provide evidence of geographic imbalance of deposits and loans and develop a methodology for investigating the contribution to this imbalance of branch networks, market power, and scope economies. Results are based on a novel measure of imbalance and estimation of a structural model of bank competition that admits interconnections across locations and between deposit and loan markets. Counterfactual experiments show branch networks, scope economies, and local competition affect credit flow to disadvantaged markets. (JEL C43, G21, G28, L13, R32)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We measure how cuts to public procurement propagate through the banking system in a financial crisis. During the European sovereign debt crisis, the Portuguese government cut procurement spending by 4.3 percent of GDP. We find that this cut saddled banks with nonperforming loans from government contractors, which led to a persistent reduction in credit supply to other firms. We estimate a bank-level elasticity of credit supply with respect to procurement demand of 2.5. In a general equilibrium model, our findings point to large effects of fiscal policy on credit supply and output in a crisis. (JEL E23, E44, E62, G01, G21, H57)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A large literature has examined how best to target antipoverty programs to those most deprived in some sense (e.g., consumption). We examine the potential trade-off between this objective and targeting those most impacted by such programs. We work in the context of an NGO cash transfer program in Kenya, employing recent advances in machine learning methods and dynamic outcome data to learn proxy means tests that jointly target both objectives. Targeting solely on the basis of deprivation is not attractive in this setting under standard social welfare criteria unless the planner’s preferences are extremely redistributive.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;My research suggests that world inequality is explained by the incidence of extractive and inclusive institutions. But why do some countries have extractive institutions? I distinguish between two main reasons; first, power relations; second, the “normative order.” Normative orders provide justifications and legitimacy for institutions which may not generate prosperity, but may achieve other goals. These distinctions are critical because they create very different challenges in trying to make institutions more inclusive and create prosperity. I show how countries move from the economic periphery as a consequence of changing both. My own intellectual journey has been in the other direction, however, hence the title of the paper: I was fortunate to be born in Britain, but I have had to unlearn much of my own experience, socialization and training in order to see other societies on their own terms. That’s crucial to be able to help them, but also to learn from them. (JEL D02, D63, E23, K00, O43, Q32)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use the tools of mechanism design combined with the theory of risk measures to analyze how a cash-constrained owner of an asset with known, stochastic returns raises capital from a population of investors who differ in their risk aversion and budget constraints. The issuer partitions the asset’s cash flow into several asset-backed securities, one for each type of investor. The optimal partition conforms to the commonly observed practice of tranching into senior debt, junior debt, and equity. Tranching arises endogenously due to the differences in risk appetites among agents and in the budget constraints they face. (JEL D81, D82, G12, G41, G51)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the fleet repositioning problem aimed at dynamically optimizing vehicle distributions to maximize long-run average social welfare in a vehicle-sharing system. We model the problem as a Markov decision process under theex antecommitted decision scheme, characterizing the balanced myopic policy as optimal for the average reward setting. This policy efficiently aligns vehicle supply with trip demand and mitigates the curse of dimensionality, enhancing computational efficiency significantly. Our analysis demonstrates that although the balanced myopic policy operates with less information, potentially leading to performance losses, the maximum performance gap relative to theex postdecision scheme asymptotically converges to zero as the system size increases. This finding underscores the asymptotic optimality of the balanced myopic policy, particularly in large systems, making it a robust and effective solution for fleet repositioning. Moreover, we extend our investigation to settings with seasonal demand, confirming that a generalized balanced myopic policy remains optimal. Through comprehensive numerical experiments and a counterfactual case study of a real-world vehicle-sharing system, we quantify the operational value of our approach. This study not only validates the balanced myopic policy against more information-intensive solutions but also illuminates effective heuristic design strategies for improving the efficiency of fleet repositioning in vehicle sharing systems.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Horizontal Consolidation in Healthcare Markets: Can Performance Incentives Preserve Access to Care?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects of hospital consolidations on access to care in a competitive healthcare market in the presence of performance incentives. We consider a transition from a “pre-merger” market configuration where a payer delegates services to a market with two competing hospitals to a “horizontally consolidated” configuration under which the same entity manages two hospitals. We focus on two research questions: How should the payer set access-based performance incentives in response to a horizontal market consolidation? What are the effects of consolidation on patient access to care? We use queueing dynamics to describe patient care processes and analyze the strategic interactions between hospitals and the optimal design of performance-based incentives in different market configurations. Specifically, we consider contracts where hospital compensation for delivering care includes a combination of fee-for-service payments and bonus components tied to the level of access to care patients receive. We derive the optimal bonus-type contracts that the payer can use to adapt to changes in market concentration, and we quantify the resulting impact on patient access to care and social welfare. In our analysis, we consider two alternative settings: the “fixed- FFS” setting, where the fee-for-service component cannot be altered, and the “flexible-FFS” setting, where both the fee-for-service and the bonus components can be adjusted in response to changes in the market composition. Our analysis shows that the bonus-type performance incentives provide payer with the ability to protect patient access to care upon hospital consolidation in a wide range of problem settings, provided that the intensity of competition between the hospitals is sufficiently strong. If, otherwise, the intensity of competition is relatively weak, horizontal consolidation may compromise access to care.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: An Adaptive Optimization Approach to Personalized Financial Incentives in Behavioral Interventions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Obesity is a critical healthcare issue affecting the United States. The least risky treatments available for obesity are behavioral interventions meant to promote diet and exercise. Often these interventions contain a mobile component that allows interventionists to collect participants level data and provide participants with incentives and goals to promote long term behavioral change. Recently, there has been interest in using direct financial incentives to promote behavior change. However, adherence is challenging in these interventions, as each participant will react differently to different incentive structure and amounts, leading researchers to consider personalized interventions. The key challenge for personalization, is that the clinicians do not know a priori how best to administer incentives to participants, and given finite intervention budgets how to disburse costly resources efficiently. In this paper, we consider this challenge of designing personalized weight loss interventions that use direct financial incentives to motivate weight loss while remaining within a budget. We create a predictive model that is able to predict how individuals may react to different incentive schedules within the context of a behavioral intervention. We integrated this predictive model in an adaptive optimization framework that over the course of the intervention computes what incentives to disburse to participants and remain within the study budget. We show that our optimization framework is asymptotically optimal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using real world data from a real world weight loss trial that used financial incentives to incentives weight loss. Our results show that using an 60-80% smaller budget, our adaptive optimization framework is able to help the same number of participants lose weight as an existing one-size-fits-all intervention. Furthermore, using our adaptive optimization framework would spend only $120 per individual across 24 weeks as opposed to the current intervention which would spend $360 per individual in the same time frame to achieve similar clinical outcomes. Our results highlight that providers who choose to implement behavioral interventions at scale will need to use a personalized approach to effectively use their limited budgets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media marketing has been relentlessly developed and integrated into firm operations. On social media platforms, firms rely on a combination of verbal and visual elements to communicate with consumers and attract their attention. The present research investigates how the semantic relationship between text and image information affects consumer engagement (forwards and comments). Leveraging a large-scale dataset of firm-generated messages, we use deep learning, LLM, and topic models to quantify each text-image message with a theorized two-dimensional text-image incongruency (relevancy and expectancy).Relevancyis how closely the information aligns with the main message.Expectancyis how predictable or surprising the information is based on what people expect, which concerns long-term affective and cognitive memories about one’s past and present experiences. We find that the interaction of relevancy and expectancy, two distinct dimensions at the cognitive level, is a crucial antecedent of consumer engagement on social media. High-relevancy-high-expectancy (HRHE) content and low-relevancy-low-expectancy (LRLE) content are the most effective strategies, whereas high-relevancy-low-expectancy (HRLE) and low-relevancy-high-expectancy (LRHE) contents do not work so well. Furthermore, this paper also uncovers the distinct nature of consumer engagement forms in social media settings, including forwards and comments. In particular, HRHE offers an exclusive benefit of boosting forwards while the two strategies are equally effective in eliciting comments. This research derives several important operational implications of consumer engagement and social media marketing by addressing the importance of multi-dimensional text-image incongruency and contributes to the literature on operations management and marketing interface.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Robust Data-Driven Design of a Smart Cardiac Arrest Response System</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the data-driven design of a smart emergency response system for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) that involves drones for automatic external defibrillator delivery and community responders alerted via a mobile application, in addition to ambulances. Our study is motivated by the widespread exploration of drones for delivery service, and the emergence of mobile applications that crowdsource community for emergency response. Based on a historical OHCA dataset with community responders’ response records from Singapore, we develop a robust joint deployment model of drone and ambulance to maximize the survivability of the response system while accounting for data uncertainty in OHCA occurrence and responder behavior. We discretize the planning area into finite demand regions, and allow different regions to have different OHCA demand rates, alert response probabilities and alert response time distributions from responders. Each of these attributes is only known to reside in an uncertainty/ambiguity set constructed from historical data. Our objective is to maximize the worst-case demand-weighted survival rate in the presence of uncertainty. We reformulate the resulting robust deployment model as a mixed-integer linear program, which can be efficiently solved by a proposed row-and-column generation algorithm with convergence guarantee. We illustrate our model and solution approach using real data from Singapore. We find that (i) hedging against uncertainty leads to a higher survival rate of the response system, compared to a sample average approximation deployment approach; (ii) while adding more drones/ambulances to the system exhibits diminishing return, a few drones are sufficient to increase the survival rate dramatically; and (iii) the impact of the behavior of responders on survival outcomes is more significant than that of simply adding drones/ambulances. We also discuss several managerial insights from the numerical experiments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the click and purchase behavior of customers in an online retail setting by employing a structural estimation approach. In particular, we aim to understand the impact of the information available to the customer before and after the click on the customer’s search and purchase behavior. We propose a sequential discrete choice framework to model the customer’s search strategy, where the customer repeatedly decides between continuing her search by clicking on a product, or stopping her search and making a purchase/no-purchase decision. By combining the click and order data, our proposed structural framework allows us todisentangleand separately estimate the attractiveness of a product before and after the click. This, in turn, allows us to identify underrated products which we calldiamonds in the rough: these are products that have low pre-click but high post-click attractiveness; thus, even though such products have a low chance of being clicked, they have a high chance of being purchased, if clicked. The proposed framework provides an online retailer with new tools and insights to better manage the product assortment based on customer click and purchase behavior. We estimate our model on a data set from the Chinese retailer JD.com. Through simulation studies, we illustrate how our model can be operationalized and used for improving assortment decisions by accounting for the customers’ search behavior. In particular, we focus on a subset of 126 substitutable products as a representative sample of the data and find that the optimal assortments under our model significantly increase the expected revenue compared to the actual assortments displayed by JD.com, and two Multinomial Logit (MNL) benchmarks.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Who Benefits from Government Tax-Subsidies for Corporate Charitable Food Donations?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leveraging government tax incentives to prompt corporate charitable giving has gained considerable popularity over the past decade. This paper sheds light on the broader consequences of the U.S. government’s tax-subsidy policy for charitable food donations, which is determined based on the fair market value (FMV) of the donated products. We incorporate the tax-subsidy into a monopolist food retailer’s after-tax profit function. Market demand is both price- and quality-dependent, and the shelf-life of the goods is determined by their initial quality and deterioration rate. The retailer makes joint quantity and pricing decisions over two periods, procuring goods at the start of the selling season and (possibly) donating at the end of period 1. We characterize the retailer’s optimal policy and specify conditions under which she donates some, all, or none of her leftover inventory. We explore the impact of government tax-subsidies on the retailer’s actions, consumer surplus, quantity of donations, and total welfare. We show that tax subsidies may motivate retailers to intentionally create supply scarcity (by donating more) to increase FMV (determined by the second-period price), thereby enhancing tax deductions. While tax subsidies encourage donations, they can also unintentionally harm consumers by reducing supply and raising prices. Interestingly, we show that a higher subsidy does not necessarily lead to more donations; the retailer may choose to donate fewer units to achieve the same tax deduction while increasing sales revenue. We investigate conditions under which tax subsidies can simultaneously increase donations, consumer surplus, and retail profit. We show that this outcome is possible only when retailers donate low-quality goods in modest quantities. Our findings reveal how FMV-dependent tax subsidies can backfire, reducing both consumer surplus and total welfare while benefiting the retailer. Governments must carefully weigh the benefits of donations against potential harm caused to consumers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Robotic mobile fulfillment (RMF) systems automate storage and transportation within fulfillment centers while still relying on human pickers. We focus on two key performance metrics in these systems, aiming to minimize overall completion time (OCT) as the primary objective and the number of required robots (NRR) as a secondary objective. We investigate two interrelated operational problems influencing these metrics:(i)pod selection, which involves choosing the mobile racks for item picking, and(ii)pod scheduling, which entails assigning these racks to pickers and determining the picking sequence. We first explore the pod scheduling problem independently, providing theoretical results. This stand-alone problem is NP-hard with at least two pickers when minimizing OCT and remains NP-hard with even one picker when minimizing NRR. The NRR objective introduces a novel optimization problem structure, contributing to scheduling theory even beyond the RMF context. We demonstrate that a simple but effective scheduling rule is asymptotically optimal for minimizing OCT with multiple pickers. For NRR minimization with a single picker, we derive theoretical performance bounds for two sequencing rules. When incorporating the pod selection problem, we focus on two approaches:(i)sequential and(ii)integrated pod selection and scheduling. The sequential approach handles pod selection first, then pod scheduling, while the integrated approach addresses both problems simultaneously within a single formulation to minimize OCT. Computational experiments using e-commerce order data reveal that the sequential approach achieves significantly faster and constant computation times, with a mean OCT similar to that of the integrated approach. We also find that our sequencing rules can reduce mean NRR by 13% to 28% without affecting OCT, compared to the case where no such rules are used. The sequential approach for OCT minimization and the proposed sequencing rules for NRR minimization are scalable to large systems with any picker count. Our experiments also explore the changes in OCT and NRR values with varying numbers of pickers. These results guide managers in assigning the desired number of pickers for a target OCT and inform managers about the average NRR they can expect for the chosen picker count.</content>

    <title>How Borrowers Respond to Dynamic Incentives? An Exploration of Repayment Decisions on Digital Credit</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how borrowers in digital credit markets respond to dynamic incentives. To this end, we leverage quasi-experimental variation in progressive lending policies to identify causal effects on repayment behavior. Our empirical strategy uncovers systematic heterogeneity in borrower responses across different stages of the borrower–lender relationship. We find that first-time borrowers who receive exogenously larger initial loans are significantly more likely to default—consistent with elevated moral hazard and increased repayment burden effects. In contrast, repeat borrowers who receive larger loan increments relative to their prior borrowing cycle exhibit substantially lower default rates. These contrasting patterns are consistent with a theoretical framework where experienced borrowers interpret loan size increases as credible signals of future credit expansion, thereby reinforcing their incentive to maintain repayment discipline. Supporting this mechanism, we document robust evidence of strategic repayment behavior, particularly among borrowers who advance rapidly through successive loan cycles. Collectively, our findings highlight the critical role of relationship dynamics in shaping borrower behavior and underscore the importance of tailoring progressive lending policies to a borrower’s experience level in order to enhance repayment outcomes across a diverse client base.This paper was accepted by Bruno Biais, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02016 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Brands in Unsafe Places: Effects of Brand Safety Incidents on Brand Outcomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Well-publicized digital media incidents, in which brand content appears adjacent to “unsafe” content (e.g., negative content that is offensive, harmful, or uncomfortable), highlight the potential risk to a brand’s reputation every time it advertises on digital platforms. Even as content moderation algorithms improve, brands cannot control digital environments fully, making it imperative for marketing managers to develop brand safety processes to keep a brand’s reputation safe withindigitaladvertising ecosystems, among their risk mitigation efforts. The current research accordingly attempts to establish when brand safety concerns are more or less likely to arise, according to specific consumer-, brand-, and incident-related moderators; why consumers react negatively to incidents, depending on their capacity to erode consumer trust in brands; and how and to what extent these combined elements affect various brand-related outcomes. Across data from Twitter (X) and six experiments, the authors distinguish brand safety incidents from other types of brand risks that demand managerial attention, and they empirically showcase how digital brand safety incidents influence consumers’ attitudes and behaviors, as well as advertisers’ outcomes. Building on these empirical findings, this article provides concrete, evidence-based suggestions for how to mitigate incidents, both before and after their occurrence.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Modeling Categorized Consumer Collections with Interlocked Hypergraph Neural Networks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers curate collections of items for various reasons and categorize them into subsets or categories based on different criteria as their collections grow. The items in a collection reflect a consumer’s preferences and the categories provide insights into the different contexts in which items are consumed. We develop a novel deep generative modeling framework that captures the network structure of consumer collections using multiple interlocked hypergraphs. Our model employs message-passing variational auto-encoders that leverage hypergraph structures and entity-specific covariates to generate probabilistic deep embeddings for consumers, items and item categories. Applying this framework to digital music collections and playlists of music consumers, we demonstrate that our model outperforms several sophisticated benchmarks in predicting linkages within these collections. We then illustrate how our approach enables firms to generate novel personalized product bundles, recommend relevant items and bundles, and dynamically expand existing bundles with new items. Beyond the music application, our method is broadly applicable to other consumer collections, such as food recipes and content collections on social curation platforms like Pinterest.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools based on Large Language Models (LLMs) are quickly reshaping how researchers conduct surveys and experiments. From reviewing the literature and designing instruments, to administering studies, coding data, and interpreting results, these tools offer substantial opportunities to improve research productivity and advance methodology. Yet with this potential comes a critical challenge: researchers often use these systems without fully understanding how they work. This article aims to provide a practical guide for effective and responsible GenAI use in primary research. We begin by explaining how GenAI systems operate, highlighting the gap between their intuitive interfaces and the underlying model architectures. We then examine different use cases throughout the research process, both the opportunities and associated risks at each stage. Throughout our review, we provide flexible tips for best practice and rules for effective and responsible GenAI use, particularly in areas pertaining to ensuring the validity of GenAI coded responses. In doing so, we hope to help researchers integrate GenAI into their workflows in a transparent, rigorous, and ethically sound manner. Our accompanying website (questionableresearch.ai) provides supporting materials, including reproducible coding templates in R and SPSS and sample pre-registrations.</content>

    <title>Extending the Turn to Work: New Directions in the Study of Social‐Symbolic Work in Organizational Life</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over the last two decades, a growing number of studies of novel forms of social‐symbolic work (e.g., identity work, boundary work, institutional work, values work, etc.) have appeared in the organization and management studies literature. This growing body of research – the ‘turn to work’ in organization theory – has provided important new insights into how actors purposefully participate in the social construction of organizations and their contexts. The aim of this special issue is to build on and extend these insights and in this introductory essay we begin by outlining a framework that provides a useful meta‐theory – the social‐symbolic work perspective – for integrating this stream of research. This perspective revolves around two key concepts: ‘social‐symbolic objects’ defined as meaningful patterns in a social system; and ‘social‐symbolic work’ defined as conscious, reflexive efforts to shape social‐symbolic objects. We then introduce the articles that appear in this special issue and identify important cross‐cutting themes. Drawing on these articles, we go on to identify potentially fruitful areas for future research on social‐symbolic work and end with a challenge to organizational scholars to build on this special issue to move our understanding of social‐symbolic work forward.</content>

    <title>Coworker Support Exceeding Expectations as a Double‐Edged Sword: The Role of Workplace Status</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most prior research has assumed that employees always appreciate coworker support. However, coworker support exceeding expectations can be considered a double‐edged sword in the workplace. Drawing on expectation violation theory, this research exploreswhenandhowcoworker support exceeding expectations becomes a positive or negative expectation violation that influences employees' interpersonal behaviour. We propose that when employees have a lower level of workplace status, coworker support exceeding their expectations is more likely to be a positive expectation violation and, therefore, will be positively related to employee gratitude and interpersonal citizenship behaviour. In contrast, when employees have a higher level of workplace status, coworker support exceeding expectations tends to be a negative expectation violation and, in turn, is positively related to employee shame and interpersonal counterproductive work behaviour. Two multiwave field surveys with Chinese employees and two scenario‐based experiments with Western workers largely support our hypotheses.</content>

    <title>Organizing for Software Product Development: The Effects of Team Structure, Product Complexity, and Cross-Team Coordination</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how software development team structures influence performance under varying conditions of product and architectural complexity. Using computational simulation grounded in organizational theory, the research compares feature teams—organized around end-to-end functionality—and component teams—organized around technical subsystems. The findings indicate that feature teams generally outperform component teams, particularly when product complexity is high. Moreover, the study reveals that the effectiveness of team structures is moderated by coordination intensity and team scope. Moderate levels of cross-team coordination yield better outcomes than minimal or excessive coordination, whereas broader subteam scopes can improve performance when coordination is costly or limited. These results have significant managerial implications for software development practice: team structure should be aligned with both the problem space and solution space complexity, coordination mechanisms must be strategically calibrated, and team boundaries should be adjusted based on the organization’s capacity to manage dependencies. The study provides a robust framework for informing team design decisions, offering insights relevant to agile software development. Practitioners are encouraged to adopt a contingency-based approach to team organization, tailoring structural choices to contextual demands in order to optimize delivery efficiency and innovation.</content>

    <title>Optimal Dual-Souring Inventory Policies with Order Tracking: Backlogging and Lost Sales Under Uncertain Lead Times</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dual-Sourcing in the Dark? Order Tracking as Your GuideThis research unlocks the power of real-time order tracking in dual-sourcing inventory systems, tackling both backlogging and lost-sales scenarios. We model a hybrid supply chain: a normal source (a two-stage tandem queue with Erlang processing times) and a fast-track emergency source that skips the first stage. We prove that, under key conditions, the optimal policy follows a dual-threshold structure with an adaptive switching curve, dictated by the emergency source’s workload. We prove this through a three-stage approach: 1) state-space simplification – cutting through complexity; 2) auxiliary system design – introducing a tractable proxy with a novel exchange axiom property to reveal optimal structure; 3) sample-path magic – bridging the proxy’s policy back to the original system. When reality breaks the ideal conditions, we craft a near-optimal heuristic that fully leverages order-tracking information. The analysis reveals a striking contrast; although order tracking benefits both systems, its impact is markedly stronger in lost-sales environments compared to backlogging scenarios.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Smart Servers, Smarter Speed Scaling: A Decentralized Algorithm for Data Center EfficiencyA team of researchers from Georgia Tech and the University of Minnesota has introduced a cutting-edge algorithm designed to optimize energy use in large-scale data centers. As detailed in their paper “Distributed Rate Scaling in Large-Scale Service Systems,” the team developed a decentralized method allowing each server to adjust its processing speed autonomously without the need for communication or knowledge of system-wide traffic. The algorithm uses idle time as a local signal to guide processing speed, ensuring that all servers converge toward a globally optimal performance rate. This innovation addresses a critical issue in modern computing infrastructure: balancing energy efficiency with performance under uncertainty and scale. The authors demonstrate that their approach not only stabilizes the system but achieves asymptotic optimality as the number of servers increases. The work is poised to significantly reduce energy consumption in data centers, which are projected to account for up to 8% of U.S. electricity use by 2030.</content>

    <title>A Theory of Leadership Meta‐Talk and the Talking‐Doing Gap</title>
    <updated>2025-06-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify managers' meta‐level talk about the positive purpose, meaning, and significance of their actions as an overlooked type of leadership behaviour and call it leadership meta‐talk. We outline why leadership meta‐talk is not necessarily truthful or deceptive, but selective and loosely coupled with leadership practice. We discuss varieties of leadership meta‐talk, namely aspirational, sub‐texting, and sensemaking meta‐talk, as well as principled, situational, formulaic, and casual meta‐talk. We show how all varieties of leadership meta‐talk draw people's attention to positive aspects of leadership practice and provide positive interpretations of it. Thus, leadership meta‐talk can positively influence attributions of leadership and portray workplaces as overly harmonious and well‐ordered, masking power imbalances and tensions and creating a quantitative and qualitative talking‐doing gap. We argue that these talking‐doing gaps are systemic rather than pathological features of the contemporary workplace because overly positive leadership meta‐talk responds to systemic pressures and opportunities for managers and provides egocentric, psycho‐relational, and public‐image benefits. In contrast, leadership practice that lives up to leadership meta‐talk is more costly, difficult, and time‐consuming than commonly assumed. Our theory reconciles attributional, behavioural, and romancing views of leadership, and offers new insights into key organizational and societal challenges, including managing healthy workplace expectations.</content>

    <title>Support for Sustainable Development Goal 5 and Social Performance: The Role of Diversity Targets, Work‐Life Balance Practices, and Female Representation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human resource management (HRM) scholarship has neither fully engaged with the United Nation's sustainable development goal 5 (SDG 5—gender equality) nor deepened knowledge of the human resource practices that most likely contribute to the implementation of this goal. We address this gap by investigating the link between SDG 5 and multinational enterprises' (MNEs) social performance. We posit that attention to SDG 5 will facilitate MNEs' capacity to formulate and implement practices to increase gender equality in work settings. Drawing from the sustainable HRM framework and social role theory, we develop three hypotheses related to the role of diversity targets and work‐life balance practices as mediators of the relationship between support for SDG 5 and MNEs' social performance. We also posit that women's representation across the organizational structure strengthens the relationship between support for SDG 5 and diversity targets as well as work‐life balance practices. We tested these relationships with 418 MNEs in the S&amp;P 500. We found that diversity targets and work‐life balance practices (i.e., flexible arrangements and daycare services) mediate the relationship between support for SDG 5 and social performance. In addition, the interaction between women's representation and support for SDG 5 enhances diversity targets and flexible arrangements. We theoretically contribute to the sustainable HRM literature by (a) revealing the reasons for a spillover effect of support for gender equality to other demographic groups; (b) explaining broader societal impacts of support for SDG 5 on the workforce, community, human rights, and product responsibility. To successfully integrate SDG 5, MNEs must weave diversity targets and work‐life balance practices into strategic planning.</content>
