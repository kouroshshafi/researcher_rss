    <title>Differential Privacy via Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Privacy-Accuracy Trade-off from an Optimization Lens: Fix a Desired Level of Privacy, Then Maximize AccuracyIn differential privacy, the de facto standard for safeguarding individual information in data analysis, noise is added to statistics to limit the disclosure of sensitive information. Greater privacy requires more noise, creating a trade-off as the added noise reduces the accuracy of the resulting statistics. Historically, researchers have addressed this by restricting themselves to families of noise mechanisms that are sufficient for a predefined privacy level and proving their performance under specific conditions. Selvi, Liu, and Wiesemann propose a novel approach that guarantees optimal accuracy for any specified privacy level. They formulate the design of privacy mechanisms as an optimization problem that minimizes the expected loss associated with the random noise mechanism while encoding differential privacy as constraints. Through detailed analyses and by leveraging tools from distributionally robust optimization, they develop an efficient optimization algorithm and derive implementable solutions with provable guarantees to solve the problem within seconds.</content>

    <title>Artificial Intelligence (AI) Assistant in Online Shopping: A Randomized Field Experiment on a Livestream Selling Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Livestream selling is an innovative form of online shopping that supports real-time interactions between streamers and consumers. However, a key challenge remains: Streamers have limited capacity to answer individual inquiries, whereas shoppers expect fast, personalized responses. This study investigates whether an AI-powered streaming assistant can address this tension by providing interactive, chat-based support to help consumers access and process information. Through a large-scale randomized field experiment on a leading livestream selling platform, we find that the AI assistant increases sales by 3.00% and reduces product return rates by 12.55%. Our analysis suggests that the AI assistant helps consumers feel more informed and confident in their purchases, thereby reducing uncertainty. At the same time, the AI assistant can occasionally disrupt the consumers’ livestream experience. Overall, the benefits of uncertainty reduction outweigh the negative influence of interruptions. For platform managers and policymakers, these findings evidence the potential of AI technology to enhance online commerce. The AI assistant is particularly effective for high-uncertainty products and for streamers with large audiences, offering implications for strategic deployment. Our research provides actionable insights for integrating AI into livestream selling and other digital commerce scenarios where real-time, AI-powered support can facilitate both consumer satisfaction and business growth.</content>

    <title>Towards the Integration of Precision Medicine in Psychiatric Care Delivery: Evaluating the Impact of Clinical Guidelines on Drug‐Related Adverse Events</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the immense potential of precision medicine to revolutionize healthcare, its integration into routine clinical practice remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the impact of Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines, which provide synthesized evidence and pharmacogenetics‐based drug dosing recommendations, on the delivery of psychiatric care enabled by precision medicine. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the effect of CPIC guidelines on serious drug‐related adverse events and explore how drug characteristics related to therapeutic uncertainty, namely drug age and drug label warning, moderate this effect. Our findings suggest that the availability of CPIC guidelines is associated with almost a 25% decrease in serious drug‐related adverse events in the context of psychiatric care delivery enabled by precision medicine. Furthermore, we find that the presence of drug label warning, as FDA‐endorsed negative news on pharmacogenetics‐related drug use, enhances the effect of CPIC guidelines and is associated with a further decrease in serious drug‐related adverse events. Post hoc analysis reveals that CPIC guidelines with high strength of evidence are associated with a significant decrease in serious drug‐related adverse events, while no such effect is observed for guidelines with low strength of evidence. These findings contribute to the nascent literature on integrating precision medicine into routine clinical practice, highlighting the consequential role of clinical guidelines in improving the effectiveness of psychiatric care delivery for individual patients enabled by precision medicine. In addition, by demonstrating how the development and implementation of robust clinical guidelines are central to minimizing serious drug‐related adverse events, the findings have policy implications for minimizing the downside risks of psychiatric care delivery.</content>

    <title>Excess Capacity, Marginal &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;, and Corporate Investment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Theory posits that when managers anticipate excess capacity, averageqbecomes a biased estimator of marginalqas the potential for underutilizing new capital reduces the marginal benefit of investing. After correcting for this source of measurement error, the explanatory power of Tobin'sqsubstantially improves in time‐series and cross‐sectional regressions as well as in out‐of‐sample tests. These findings, together with a secular erosion in capacity utilization, help explain why corporate investment rates have been declining for decades despite averageqincreasing significantly. Our analysis indicates that economic rigidities have contributed to the persistent erosion in capacity utilization.</content>

    <title>“Descended from Immigrants and Revolutionists:” How Family History Shapes Immigration Policymaking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does family history matter for policymaking in democracies? Linking members of Congress to the census, we observe countries of birth for members, their parents, and their grandparents, allowing us to measure ancestry for the politicians in office when U.S. immigration policy changed dramatically, from closing the border in the 1920s to reshaping admittance criteria in the 1960s. We find that legislators descended from immigrant parents or grandparents support more permissive immigration legislation. They are also less likely to speak negatively about immigration in speeches before Congress. A regression discontinuity design analyzing close elections, which addresses district-level selection and holds district composition constant, confirms our results on roll call voting and speech. Efforts to account for selection into immigration—such as comparing international immigrants to domestic migrants and exploiting variation in restrictive legislation targeting specific regions of origin—further confirm the relationship between family immigration experience and more permissive stances on immigration policy. We then explore mechanisms, finding support for in-group identity in connecting family history with policymaking. MCs name their children in ways that express immigrant identity, and immigrant-descended MCs discuss immigration using more personal frames, emphasizing family over economic considerations. Our findings illustrate the important role of personal background in legislative behavior in democratic societies, even on major and controversial topics like immigration, and suggest how experiences transmitted from previous generations can inform lawmakers’ views.</content>

    <title>Reject or Protect? Corrective Action in Response to Women’s vs. Men’s Reports of Workplace Abuse</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations encourage employees to report abusive behavior as such reports are believed to facilitate corrective action against transgressors. However, there are competing perspectives on whether reports made by women (versus men) will facilitate corrective action. On the one hand, a dominant stream of research suggests that reports made by women are often ignored and disregarded because women are not seen as credible. On the other hand, an emerging stream of research suggests that third parties will see reports made by women as serious and important. To reconcile these perspectives, we draw on aversive discrimination theory, which hints that the degree of corroboration about abuse plays a key role. That is, under situations of low corroboration, third parties are unlikely to take corrective action when women (versus men) make reports, but under situations of high corroboration, third parties are equally or even more likely to take corrective action when women (versus men) make reports. We additionally theorize and find that corroboration is particularly influential when the reporter’s general credibility is not established. Our empirical package includes six complementary studies: an archival data set of U.S. Government employees and five preregistered experiments.Funding: For financial assistance, we thank the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [Junior Faculty Development Award].</content>

    <title>Submission titled: “It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it”: Committed consumers' voluntary emotion work in alternative market systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite increasing attention to alternative market systems, where consumers perform considerable voluntary labor, consumer researchers have a limited understanding of the nature or implications of the emotion work entailed in making such contributions. This paper addresses this gap, focusing on “committed consumers” defined as those who provide extensive volunteer labor to support alternative markets and their principles. It does so based on hermeneutic analysis of ethnographic and netnographic data collected from participants in local food markets (REKO markets) in Norway. The paper identifies four distinct types of institutional emotion work that contribute to perpetuating alternative markets and conceptualizes how committed consumers' own emotions are affected when making such contributions. This paper extends our understanding of consumers' roles in alternative market systems and of the socially constituted and constitutive emotions entailed in consumer volunteerism.</content>

    <title>Strategic Scientific Disclosure: Evidence from the Leahy–Smith America Invents Act</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the impact of technological competition on voluntary innovation disclosure around the enactment of the Leahy–Smith America Invents Act of 2011 (“AIA”). The AIA moves the US patent system from the first‐to‐invent to first‐inventor‐to‐file system and induces a patent race that increases technological competition. Firms that are slow to file a patent are disadvantaged in this race. We find that focal firms with lagging patent classes strategically increase scientific publications in their lagging technology areas in an attempt to block competitors from obtaining a patent. This effect is more pronounced in technology areas where the firm has better information about their relative competitive position (proxied by greater inventor mobility), in technology classes with constraints on increasing patent filing timeliness (proxied by fewer experienced attorneys), and areas characterized by more intense competition. We find that the peers of firms with lagging classes experience greater patent filing rejections for lack of novelty and obviousness reasons after the AIA, suggesting that strategic scientific disclosure is effective.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Researchers constantly face challenging new phenomena that warrant study. Although we do a remarkable job of studying these phenomena, we continue to miss a big opportunity to learn from these findings in ways that can help future work. This article calls for researchers to re-think common major research processes to abstract principles that can lead to more cumulative knowledge. Specifically, this paper suggests change related to four research activities—defining the problem, anchoring to prior research, seeking novelty, and reporting practices.</content>

    <title>A Multi‐Level Systems Perspective on (Un)sustainable &lt;scp&gt;HRM&lt;/scp&gt; in Adult Social Care</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper contributes to sustainable HRM theory, policy, and practice by applying and extending systems theory. A framing is developed and applied by triangulating data from 85 interviews with workers, managers, and other stakeholders (e.g., unions, employer representatives, charities) in adult social care, along with qualitative and quantitative secondary data sources. The findings highlight three main (un)sustainable HRM challenges shaped by inconsistencies between employment in the public and independent sectors:constrained system resources,disconnected career structures, anduneven voice patterns. The article contributes to HR theory by re‐framing “(un)sustainable HRM” to include how actors are constrained and/or supported by multi‐level relationships between systems and sub‐systems. The research advances policy and practice by proposing how more sustainable HRM approaches could be implemented.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As threats to democracy endanger the rights and freedoms of people around the world, scholars are increasingly interrogating the role that organizations play in shaping democratic and authoritarian societies. Just as societies can be more or less democratic, so, too, can organizations. This essay, in honor ofASQ’s 70th volume, argues for a deeper focus in organizational research on the extent to which organizations themselves are democratic and the outcomes associated with these varied models of organizing. First, we provide a framework for considering the extent to which organizations are democratically organized, accounting for the varied ways in which workers can participate in their organizations. Second, we call for research on the outcomes associated with democratic organizing at both the organizational and societal levels. We build from research arguing that the extent to which workers participate in organizational decision making can spill over to impact their expectations of and participation in civic life. Moving forward, we argue it is critical to recognize that questions of democracy and authoritarianism concern not only the political contexts in which organizations are embedded but also how organizations themselves are structured and contribute to society.</content>

    <title>In Safe Hands: The Financial and Real Impact of Investor Composition over the Credit Cycle</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I show that investor composition affects bond price dynamics and capital allocation during crises. Using large-scale holdings data and within-firm ownership variation across near-identical bonds, I causally identify bond returns’ investor composition elasticities. Corporate bonds held predominantly by insurers rather than mutual funds suffer milder losses in downturns: increasing insurer holdings by half a bond’s size causes 20% shallower drawdowns. A shift-share instrument isolates variation from large insurers’ idiosyncratic primary-market allocations. Differences in intermediaries’ liability structures drive these results, which hold across countries. During crises, firms with more stable bondholders maintain higher borrowing at lower cost and invest more. (JEL G00, G12, G23, G30, E22, E30)</content>

    <title>Common Pricing of Decentralized Risk: A Linear Option Pricing Model</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a top-down linear option pricing model that unifies the pricing of different option contracts not by assuming common dynamics but by imposing common pricing on each risk source in proportion to decentralized risk estimates. The model generates significantly better pricing performance than existing bottom-up models. Its high-dimensional risk structure effectively explains the options return variation, allowing for the seamless integration of option pricing with risk management. The market price of risk estimate from the model strongly predicts the future excess return of the corresponding risk-targeting option portfolio, an important dimension of attribute completely absent from prior literature.

    <title>‘Bad’ Oil, ‘Worse’ Oil and Carbon Misallocation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Not all barrels of oil are created equal: their extraction varies in both private cost and carbon intensity. Leveraging a comprehensive micro-dataset on world oil fields, alongside detailed estimates of carbon intensities and private extraction costs, this study quantifies the additional emissions and costs from having extracted the ’wrong’ deposits. We do so by comparing historical deposit-level supplies to counterfactuals that factor in pollution costs, while keeping annual global consumption unchanged. Between 1992 and 2018, carbon misallocation amounted to at least 11.00 gigatons of CO2-equivalent, incurring an environmental cost evaluated at $2.2 trillion (US$2018). This translates into a significant supply-side ecological debt for major producers of high-carbon oil. Looking forward, we estimate the gains from making deposit-level extraction socially optimal at about 9.30 gigatons of CO2-equivalent evaluated at $1.9 trillion along a future aggregate demand pathway coherent with the objective of net-zero emissions in 2050, and document unequal reserve stranding across oil nations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do global value chain (GVC) linkages modify countries’ incentives to impose import protection? Are these linkages important determinants of trade policy in practice? We develop a new approach to modeling tariff setting with GVCs, in which optimal policy depends on the nationality of value-added content embedded in home and foreign final goods. Theory predicts that discretionary tariffs will be decreasing in the domestic content of foreign-produced final goods and the foreign content of domestically-produced final goods. Using data for 14 countries between 1995 and 2015, we show that governments set lower tariffs and curb their use of temporary trade barriers where GVC linkages are strongest, consistent with theory. Turning to quantitative model counterfactuals, we find that severing GVC linkages would lead to the disappearance of tariff preferences. Further, targeted policies to decouple China from GVCs would increase the optimal tariff set by G7 countries on Chinese exports.</content>

    <title>Abundance Versus Scarcity: An Experimental Study of Financially Constrained Newsvendors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study experimentally investigates the ordering behavior of a financially constrained newsvendor‐like retailer facing stochastic demand under trade credit. Using controlled laboratory experiments, we examine the ordering behavior of a retailer procuring inventory on trade credit from the supplier under no‐bankruptcy risk (NBR) and bankruptcy risk (BR) at low‐ and high‐profit margins. Our experimental observations show deviations from normative optimality, and we find a contrast in the ordering behavior in NBR and BR settings. Compared to the respective normative optimal quantities, in the NBR setting, retailers overorder in the low‐profit margin and underorder in the high‐profit margin conditions, whereas, in the BR setting, consistent underordering is observed in both the low and high‐profit margin conditions. Next, we employ a dynamic panel regression model driven by the demand‐chasing heuristic to capture the ordering pattern. Finally, we develop a prospect theoretic model to describe the underordering behavior observed in the BR setting and find that the reference point plays a key role. Our results provide insights into the need to identify the behavior of financially constrained retailers and develop descriptive models for improved decision making.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Whispers in Your Mind: the Role of Voice Features in Customer Acquisition and Retention</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While most marketing studies have focused on what salespeople say, less is known about the persuasiveness of how they say it, particularly in the distinct contexts of customer acquisition and retention. This research investigates how salespeople’s vocal brightness and loudness influence new and existing customers’ purchase behavior. Based on two studies conducted in China (a field study using a large real-world dataset of over 8,000 telephone calls and a randomized controlled experiment), the authors find that high brightness and high loudness positively predict new customers’ purchase behavior and timing, whereas low brightness and high loudness positively affect existing customers’ repurchase behavior and timing. The authors demonstrate that perceived arousal is the underlying mechanism driving customers’ purchase behavior in customer acquisition, while perceived competence serves as a mediator in customer retention. No effect of brightness or loudness on purchase volume is observed in either customer acquisition or retention. This research makes theoretical contributions to the marketing and nonverbal communication literature. It also provides valuable managerial insights regarding how to manipulate voice features to improve sales performance.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Too Many or Too Few? Information Cues in Recommender Systems and Consequences for Search and Purchase Behavior</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how the number of information cues in recommender systems influences consumer search and purchase. E-commerce platforms often display a list of recommended products on product pages, where consumers can browse and click on individual items for details. Given space constraints, determining the appropriate amount of information to display is crucial, as it affects consumers’ use of both recommender systems and non-recommender search tools. Through a field experiment with an online retailer, we test four information designs: no cues (product name only), single cues (either price or review), and dual cues (price and review). We find an inverted U-shaped relationship between the number of information cues and sales, with single cues yielding the highest sales compared to both more (dual cues) and less information (no cues). This nonlinear effect stems from the interplay between search intensity and efficiency. The no-cue condition increases search intensity but forces consumers to rely on a less efficient non-recommender search process. In contrast, the highly efficient dual-cue condition provides sufficient information for evaluation but discourages further exploration beyond recommenders. Single cues strike a balance, offering just enough information to aid product evaluation while maintaining high search intensity across both recommender and non-recommender tools.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Curating the Crowd: How Firms Manage Social Fit to Stage Social Atmospheres</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In sectors across the experience economy—from live sports to festivals, nightlife entertainment, private members’ clubs, and invite-only events—firms compete by staging social atmospheres. When firms successfully stage social atmospheres, they benefit from enhanced customer experiences, loyalty, and place attachment. However, social atmospheres often fail when firms struggle to bring together the ‘optimal mix’ of customers. Yet marketing research offers limited insight into how firms can attract and select heterogeneous customers who fit together productively to create meaningful shared experiences of place. Accordingly, this article draws on aesthetic work literature to conceptualizesocial atmosphere curation—the process through which firms manage customer heterogeneity to achieve social fit as a means to stage social atmospheres. Through an ethnographic study of Berlin’s iconic electronic music club scene, this paper reveals a three-stage social atmosphere curation model, comprising curation mechanisms of cultivation, selection, and mystification. This research advances marketing scholarship’s understanding of social atmospheres, customer heterogeneity, and marketplace inclusion and exclusion. By outlining the managerial tasks associated with each curation mechanism, this study provides actionable guidance for managers across various service contexts on how to curate the right crowd to deliberately stage social atmospheres.</content>

    <title>A Study of Ride-Hailing Platforms’ Business Models in the Presence of Surge Demand</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractThis study analyzes whether a ride-hailing platform should adopt a closed business model, that is, serving riders only with platform-owned vehicles, or an open business model, that is, allowing private vehicles to utilize the platform to provide services. Analytical results reveal that the open business model leads to more service supply (supply-augmenting effect) and a lower price increase (price discrimination–hindering effect) in the surge period, both benefiting riders. It also reduces the number of idle vehicles in the normal period, thus resulting in more efficient utilization of vehicle resources. Interestingly, the platform does not always benefit from adopting the open business model. In sum, the open business model always benefits the riders, private drivers, and the society as a whole, but it may not be more profitable for the platform. This interesting result calls for policymakers to incentivize the platform so that it adopts the open business model instead of the closed one.</content>

    <title>Uncertainty, Contracting, and Beliefs in Organizations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the impact of uncertainty on optimal contracting in a multidivisional firm. Headquarters contract with division managers to induce effort. Uncertainty creates endogenous disagreement, thereby aggravating moral hazard. By hedging uncertainty, headquarters design incentive contracts that reduce disagreement and lower incentive provision costs, thereby promoting effort. Because hedging uncertainty can conflict with hedging risk, optimal contracts differ from those in standard principal-agent models. Our model helps explain the prevalence of equity-based incentive contracts and the rarity of relative-performance contracts, especially in firms facing greater uncertainty. (JEL G12, G31)</content>

    <title>Does a Theory-of-Value Add Value? Evidence from a Randomized Control Trial with Tanzanian Entrepreneurs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs making decisions under uncertainty are encouraged to evaluate their initial ideas through hypothesis testing, but entrepreneurial approaches vary in their emphasis on ex-ante theory development prior to collecting evidence. In this paper, we examine whether and how entrepreneurs benefit from adopting an evidence-based approach or a theory-and-evidence-based approach to decision making. We conducted a field experiment with Tanzanian agribusiness entrepreneurs by randomly assigning entrepreneurs to two different training conditions. We find that entrepreneurs in the theory-and-evidence–based condition have higher economic performance during the observation period following the intervention. We conjecture this result stems from differences in the types of changes enacted: entrepreneurs in the theory-and-evidence–based training make more coordinated changes that encompass both core and operational elements of their business models.Funding: This work was supported by the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research [Grant DFs-18-0000000008], the Rockefeller Foundation [Grant 2018 FOD 004], and Ed Snider Center for Enterprise and Markets.

    <title>Let Us Not Speak of Them, But Look and Pass? Organizational Responses to Online Reviews</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a world where five stars have become the standard for evaluating many transactions and consumers turn to the crowd for guidance when making a wide variety of choices, organizations cannot dismiss online reviews as inconsequential. And whereas we know a lot about how organizations respond to reviews online, there has been a lack of systematic evidence showing how organizations behave in response to online feedback once their screens are turned off. This paper leverages a novel combination of insights from a lab-in-the-field experiment, an archival study, and two rounds of qualitative interviews in the French restaurant industry to examine online and offline responses to reviewer feedback. We identify characteristics of the review, the restaurant, and the respondent that influenced when restaurants in our sample were more likely to align their actions online and offline and when they were more likely to decouple them—that is, posting an online response promising to take corrective action while having no intention to change how the restaurant operates “in real life.” We conclude by speculating on potential mechanisms behind our respondents’ reactions and discussing our contribution to the literature on producer reactivity and the symbolic management of change.Funding: This work was supported by Università Bocconi, Labex Ecodec, and Fondation HEC.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2020.14091 .</content>

    <title>Correction to “How Does Financial‐Reporting Regulation Affect Industry‐Wide Resource Allocation?”</title>
    <updated>2025-03-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Matthias Breuer</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This correction describes errors in the program code of Breuer [2021] and presents revised results. The errors affect the construction of the standardized reporting and auditing scopes, the treatment variables of the primary research design in Breuer [2021]. The revised results show weaker evidence that reporting mandates facilitate ownership dispersion in capital markets compared to Breuer [2021]. They also show weaker evidence that reporting mandates spur competition in product markets, including mixed evidence on product‐market entry. Consistent with Breuer [2021], the revised results continue to show no unambiguous evidence that reporting mandates improve the efficiency of industry‐wide resource allocation. With respect to audit mandates, the revised results continue to show evidence that the mandates impose a barrier to entry. Overall, the correction indicates that the impacts of reporting and auditing mandates are even more uncertain than reported in Breuer [2021] and that further research on these impacts is called for.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I study how the secular decline in interest rates affects banks' intermediation spreads and credit supply. Following a permanent decrease in rates, bank lending may rise initially but contracts in the long run. As lower rates compress deposit spreads even well above the zero lower bound, banks' retained earnings, equity, and lending fall until loan spreads have risen enough to offset the reduction in deposit spreads. A higher inflation target can support bank lending at the cost of higher liquidity premia. I find support for the model's predictions in U.S. aggregate and bank‐level data.</content>

    <title>Intrahousehold Disagreement about Macroeconomic Expectations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper highlights the simple fact that households typically consist of multiple members who may hold divergent views, a fact that existing approaches to measuring and modeling household macroeconomic expectations largely abstract from. Using unique data on the macroeconomic expectations of both spouses, I document substantial intrahousehold disagreement about inflation, economic recessions, and stock market returns. I further show that household asset allocation decisions are shaped by disagreement between spouses about future stock returns, and a preregistered randomized survey experiment confirms the causal impact of such disagreement on portfolio choice.</content>
