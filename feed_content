    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Jointly Making Inventory Stocking and Assortment Offering DecisionsMaking the product assortment offer decisions for a customer requires keeping a balance between offering an assortment that will satisfy the current customer and reserving the products with scarce inventories for the customers who will arrive in the future. Therefore, whereas the assortment offer decisions should depend on the current inventories of the products, the stocking decisions should anticipate how the offered assortments will deplete the inventories, thereby creating a natural interaction between inventory stocking and assortment offer decisions. In “Coordinated Inventory Stocking and Assortment Customization,” Bai, El Housni, Rusmevichientong, and Topaloglu develop models that jointly make the assortment offer and inventory stocking decisions. Their models allocate the limited stocking capacity to the inventories for different products, while taking into consideration the assortment offer decisions that will be made for the customers arriving over a selling horizon.</content>

    <title>The Last Hurrah Effect: End-of-Period Temporal Landmarks Increase Optimism and Financial Risk-Taking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Understanding what drives risk-taking is fundamental for the study of choice under uncertainty. One widely discussed question is when and why people engage in risk-taking. Prior work finds evidence for an ending effect, where risk-taking increases on the last gamble in a series when outcomes are immediately realized. The authors test whether socially ubiquitous end-of-period temporal landmarks (e.g., last day of the work week, month, year) alter financial risk-taking even when outcomes are not immediate. Using data from a large peer-to-peer investment platform in the United States, they show that investors make riskier financial investment decisions on Fridays relative to those made earlier in the week. Consistent with a broader end-of-period effect, risk-taking also increases on the last day of the month, on the last day of the year, and on weekdays prior to a long weekend. Follow-up lab experiments identify a novel mechanism driving ending effects: As people near the end of a temporal period, they feel more optimistic that their financial risks will pay off, driving greater financial risk-taking. The shift in risk-taking is not without consequence: In this specific peer-to-peer context, the authors show that end-of-period investments perform worse over time, losing money relative to investments made on other days.</content>

    <title>The Relationship Between Organizational Authenticity Perceptions and Employees’ Work Performance: Evidence From a Field Experiment</title>
    <updated>2025-02-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The concept of organizational authenticity—the consistency between an organization’s espoused values and its lived practices—has garnered considerable interest in academic discourse. While the authenticity literature has paid much attention to external stakeholders (e.g., clients), the notion of organizational authenticity perceptions of an important stakeholder—employees—has been understudied. Despite prior evidence of external stakeholders’ positive reactions to organizational authenticity perceptions, whether and how it can also affect employees and their work performance remains an open question. I undertook a randomized field experiment in a large, global consulting company to examine how employee perceptions of organizational authenticity affect their work performance. Compared with the control group, those who perceived their organization as authentic demonstrated higher performance. I show evidence that employee trust in the organization mediates the relationship between employee perceptions of organizational authenticity and work performance. Alternative mediators—organizational identification and organizational likability—did not explain this relationship. The study’s results advance the literature by revealing the important role of organizational authenticity perceptions among an internal stakeholder—employees—and the way it affects work performance.</content>

    <title>Repo over the Financial Crisis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper uses new data to provide a comprehensive view of repo activity during the 2007 global financial crisis. We show that activity declined much more in the bilateral segment of the market than in the tri‐party segment. Surprisingly, a large share of the decline in activity is driven by repos backed by Treasury securities. Further, a disproportionate share of the decline in repo activity is connected to securities dealer's market‐making activity. In particular, the evidence suggests that at least part of the decline is not driven by clients pulling away from securities dealers because of counterparty credit concerns.</content>

    <title>Digital Goods Reselling: Implications on Cannibalization and Price Discrimination</title>
    <updated>2025-02-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The resale of used products presents the challenge of cannibalization, particularly pronounced in digital goods markets where perfect substitutes are easily replicable. In this article, we assert that, rather than a threat, resale can serve as an effective pricing tool for managing heterogeneous demand. We consider a seller of digital goods/services who offers a contract to a heterogeneous group of customers at a fixed price for a specified amount of usage allowance. Rather than imposing restrictive sharing barriers, the seller allows subscribers to share their allowances with others in a secondary market. Our analysis reveals that the seller’s optimal strategy involves facilitating resale by eliminating transaction costs. The sharing contract effectively achieves the same outcome as a two-part tariff, wherein subscribers pay an entry fee along with a marginal usage rate. Both approaches generate equivalent revenue and market coverage, and result in idential demand and individual surplus for customers of the same type. Consequently, the sharing contract acts as a mechanism for price discrimination. Our finding provides a new perspective on peer-to-peer resales and also challenges the conventional belief that successful price discrimination hinges on preventing resale.</content>

    <title>Deterministic Budget-Feasible Clock Auctions</title>
    <updated>2025-02-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the budget-feasible mechanism design problem, an auctioneer with a strict budget constraint is looking to acquire services from a set of self-interested providers. The auctioneer aims to design a polynomial-time strategy-proof mechanism that maximizes the value of the services she acquires, subject to the sum of payments to providers falling within her budget. This problem has attracted a great deal of attention due to its combination of practical relevance and theoretical depth. In “Deterministic Budget-Feasible Clock Auctions,” Balkanski, Garimidi, Gkatzelis, Schoepflin, and Tan provide the first such deterministic mechanism that achieves a constant-factor approximation for instances where the auctioneer’s valuation function is submodular. Moreover, this mechanism achieves an improved approximation even compared with previously known randomized mechanisms, and it takes the form of a clock auction, implying a suite of important properties that make this auction much more practical.</content>

    <title>Antisocial Responses to the “Coal to Gas” Regulation: An Unintended Consequence of a Residential Energy Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Policies geared toward environmental and economic improvement could unexpectedly lead to negative consequences in other dimensions. Such cases raise a red flag to economists and policymakers who aim to deliver comprehensive and sensible policy evaluations. This article investigates antisocial behaviors in response to the Clean Winter Heating Policy (CWHP), which seeks to improve outdoor air quality. Our results show that participating villagers are more likely to violate laws to burn agricultural waste and exhibit lower prosociality in incentivized dictator games and public goods games. We further explore treatment heterogeneities and find that two channels are likely to play a part. First, the CWHP was perceived as a negative income shock. Therefore, the villagers would want to reduce their expenditure on straw disposal and behave less generously in the incentivized games. Second, the CWHP could trigger discontent and directly affect social preference. Additional evidence suggests that the antisocial (less prosocial) responses could have been avoided by granting larger upfront subsidies.This paper was accepted by Axel Ockenfels, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: J.

    <title>The Golden Halo of Defaults in Simple Choices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Defaults are pervasive in consumer choice. The authors combine eye-tracking laboratory experiments with cognitive modeling to pinpoint the influence of defaults in the decision process and conduct naturalistic experiments with large preregistered samples to test the limits of defaults on consumer choices. Contrary to previous assumptions, in simple binary choices, default options did not potentiate rapid heuristic-based decisions but instead altered processes of attention and valuation. Model comparison indicated that defaults received a positive boost in value—a “golden halo”—that was large enough to increase hedonic choices when the default was hedonic, but had limited effects for utilitarian defaults or for when defaults were incongruent with background goals. The findings illustrate and quantify the mechanisms through which default options shape subsequent decisions in simple choices. Further, the authors establish boundary conditions for when defaults can and cannot be used to nudge consumer choice.</content>

    <title>Are We Worse Off After Policy Repeals? Evidence from Two Green Policies</title>
    <updated>2025-02-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Implementation of public policies sometimes results in spillover effects on nontargeted outcomes. When policy makers repeal these policies due to industry pressure and community resistance, do the spillover effects from the policy persist after a repeal? Specifically, the authors ask (1) whether these spillovers induced by policy, when present, carry on after a repeal (i.e., become “carryovers”); (2) how these carryovers evolve over the short and medium term; and (3) what benefit thresholds the policy must meet to offset spillovers during implementation and carryovers after repeal. To address these questions, the authors examine two pro-environment policies that were later repealed: a ban on single-use plastic grocery bags and the imposition of a fee. They find that the increase in trash bag sales, which began during policy implementation, persisted for several months after repeal. A break-even analysis suggests that the net effect on plastic bag savings is likely positive even after repeal. Only modest reductions in grocery bag use would be needed to break even, suggesting a favorable outcome for the environment. This study alerts policy makers and firms to potential carryovers from policy repeals that can persist well after a repeal.</content>

    <title>Retailer Differentiation in Social Media: An Investigation of Firm-Generated Content on Twitter</title>
    <updated>2025-02-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media platforms have been used by firms for a variety of purposes: building firms’ brand image, increasing customer engagement, and providing customer service, among others. However, there is little research on content strategies adopted by traditional rival firms competing on online social media platforms. This article seeks to fill this gap by examining whether retailers traditionally identified as close competitors mirror this rivalry in their social media content strategies on Twitter (now known as X). To this end, this study introduces a new metric for assessing competition on online social media, based on content similarity. The authors find that retailers competing closely in traditional contexts show greater divergence in their content strategies on social media, and firms whose social media content strategies are less similar to content strategies of their close traditional rivals benefit from higher engagement and acquire new followers faster. In examining the mechanism of the effect, the authors find that these divergent firms’ improved performance is attributable to their superior ability to leverage the higher-level affordances of Twitter as compared with their rivals. The results of this study offer valuable insights for firms seeking to distinguish their social media content from that of their competitors.</content>

    <title>Sponsored Content as an Epistemic Market Object: How Platformization of Brand–Creator Partnerships Disrupts Valuation, Coproduction, and the Relationship Between Market Actors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sponsored content allows brands to partner with creators to reach creators’ audiences on digital platforms. However, both creators’ and brands’ incomplete understanding of this object generates two critical ambiguities: how to determine the value of sponsored content and how to effectively coproduce it. To better understand these ambiguities, the authors theorize sponsored content as an epistemic market object: an object that facilitates marketing functions but is only partially understood by the actors who use it . They analyze a dataset of interviews, podcasts, media articles, and third-party platform reviews about—and by—content creators, brands, and intermediaries. The findings show that brands, creators, and intermediaries create and apply knowledge to address valuation and coproduction ambiguities. However, this knowledge work is incomplete, creating asymmetries in value outcomes and power relationships in a brand–creator partnership. This research contributes to marketing literature and practice by highlighting the role of epistemic market objects in transformative market disruptions that alter the roles of, and the relationships between, market actors. The findings are transferable to other substantive areas such as generative artificial intelligence, the metaverse, nonfungible tokens, online news, and the sharing economy.</content>

    <title>Agent-Oriented Impression Management: Who Wins When Firms Publicize Their New CEOs?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this study, we advance organizational impression management research by focusing on agent-oriented impression management—which reflects attempts to create value for the firm by publicizing individuals or groups who are agents of the firm. Although prevalent in practice, agent-oriented impression management remains unexplored in scholarly research. Specifically, we introduce the concept of new CEO prominence in firm communication (PFC), defined as the frequency and centrality of new CEO mentions in firm press releases and social media. We argue that new CEO PFC is distinct from traditional impression management tactics because CEOs are agents of the firm that will personally benefit from these impression management strategies. Thus, our research addresses the question: Who captures the value associated with new CEO PFC? We theorize that firms benefit from featuring new CEOs in firm communication through improved external stakeholder evaluations (i.e., analyst ratings). However, these efforts may also create value for the CEOs, as evidenced by increased compensation, more outside directorships, and decreased turnover rates. Our empirical study of efforts to publicize a new CEO following 557 succession events strongly supports our theory.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study links between the labor market for loan officers and access to mortgage credit. Using novel data matching mortgage applications to loan officers, we find that minorities are underrepresented among loan officers. Minority borrowers are less likely to complete mortgage applications, have completed applications approved, and to ultimately take up a loan. These disparities are reduced when minority borrowers work with minority loan officers. These pairings also lead to lower default rates, suggesting minority loan officers have an informational advantage with minority borrowers. Our results suggest minority underrepresentation among loan officers reduces minority borrowers’ access to credit.</content>

    <title>“You Pretend to Pay Me; I Pretend to Work”: A Multi‐Level Exploration of Quiet Quitting in the Greek Context</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study explores quiet quitting—a distinct form of workplace withdrawal—in the Greek context, adopting a multilevel approach to understand how cultural, institutional and individual factors shape this emerging phenomenon. Drawing upon relevant literature, we investigate the macro, meso‐organizational, and micro‐individual level factors that shape the emergence and persistence of quiet quitting. Through a qualitative, interview‐based methodology, we engage with a diverse sample of Greek Human Resource (HR) managers to capture their perceptions and lived experiences of the factors that contribute to quiet quitting. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between societal shifts, cultural norms, organizational practices, and individual coping mechanisms that give rise to and sustain quiet quitting behaviors. We propose a conceptual framework that situates quiet quitting within the unique socio‐cultural, economic, and institutional realities of the Greek context. This framework reveals how quiet quitting manifests as a dynamic process, initiated by psychological contract breaches and perpetuated through cycles of emotional exhaustion and identity rationalization. By providing a holistic understanding of the quiet quitting phenomenon, this study contributes to the advancement of contextualized Human Resource Management (HRM) research and offers valuable insights for practitioners navigating the challenges of the modern workplace.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how humans learn from artificial intelligence (AI), leveraging an introduction of an AI‐powered Go program (APG) that unexpectedly outperformed the best professional player. We compare the move quality of professional players to APG's superior solutions around its public release. Our analysis of 749,190 moves demonstrates significant improvements in players' move quality, especially in the early stages of the game where uncertainty is highest. This improvement was accompanied by a higher alignment with AI's suggestions and a decreased number and magnitude of errors. Young players show greater improvement, suggesting potential inequality in learning from AI. Further, while players of all skill levels benefit, less skilled players gain higher marginal benefits. These findings have implications for managers seeking to adopt and utilize AI in their organizations.Managerial AbstractWe examine how professionals can learn from artificial intelligence (AI) by studying an AI‐powered Go program (APG) that outperformed the best professional player. By analyzing 749,190 moves, we find that players' move quality improved significantly, closely aligning with the AI's recommendations. The number and magnitude of errors also decreased. This learning effect was particularly strong early in the game where decisions are more uncertain. Young players showed greater effect, suggesting that learning from AI may vary by age. While players of all skill levels benefited, those with less skill saw the greatest improvement. These findings highlight the instructional role of AI and offer guidance on how to effectively integrate AI into organizations to enhance worker performance across different age groups and skill levels.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The emotional rollercoaster of entrepreneurship is characterized by encounters with challenges that impede venture progress. Consequently, resilience, which is reflected in the ability to maintain functioning through such challenges, has become of particular interest to scholars. Existing research emphasizes the ability of resilient individuals to use positive emotions to overcome challenges. Yet, scholarship has largely overlooked the role of affective fluctuations in resilience processes, which is problematic for entrepreneurs facing the chahighs and lows of venturing. This daily diary study of technology entrepreneurs reveals that those who are more resilient report smaller day‐to‐day fluctuations in their affective state over the course of two working weeks. This finding suggests that theory on self‐regulation may serve as an important key in understanding the microprocesses underlying resilience.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurship is often considered an emotional rollercoaster. For this reason, many entrepreneurs are interested in understanding resilience and its role in managing the ups and downs of business venturing. This research examines the relationship between resilience and fluctuations in affect by studying entrepreneurs over the course of two working weeks, as they confront a challenge in their venture. The results show that entrepreneurs who are more resilient also report smaller changes in affect day‐to‐day. This suggests that entrepreneurs looking to enact resilience may need to turn the emotional rollercoaster of entrepreneurship into a train ride.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present a novel methodology for the out-of-sample forecast of the equity premium. Our predictive slope coefficient is a conservative constant that has a lower bias than the zero slope employed by the historical average, but has the same variance. We demonstrate that, theoretically and empirically, our method dominates the historical average in forecast performance. Our methodology establishes a simple yet powerful paradigm for exploiting the real-time equity premium predictability derived from a predictor. Applications of our method reveal that many predictors can forecast the equity premium, and that parameter estimates in previous studies add value to out-of-sample forecasts.

    <title>Revisiting Board Independence Mandates: Evidence from Director Reclassifications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide causal evidence on the effects of mandated board independence. We compare firms that replace existing non-independent directors to firms that retain these directors by reclassifying them as independent. Reclassification eligibility, being largely predetermined, offers quasi-exogenous variation in compliance strategies. We show that firms required to replace insiders perform worse post-mandate, driven by increased operational costs and reduced labor efficiency. Boards of non-reclassifying firms retain fewer former employees and replace them with directors more likely to join monitoring-focused committees, emphasizing the shift from advising to monitoring. Overall, these findings suggest that firm-specific director expertise contributes materially to performance and is consistent with pre-mandate board compositions optimized to balance benefits of enhanced monitoring against costs of reduced advisory capacity. We rule out alternative explanations, including adjustment costs due to director turnover and co-option. Our study underscores the importance of allowing firms flexibility in governance structures and cautions against uniform mandates.</content>

    <title>Design and Analysis of Efficient Sequencing Policies for Linear Cold Storage Devices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article, we investigate the problem of sequencing data requests for linear devices, such as magnetic tapes, to minimize response time in cold-storage solutions for archival data. Tapes are the technology of choice for long-term storage due to their reliability, low costs, security, and significant energy savings. However, physical limitations on tape pose challenges to policy implementation, which must be scalable on low-power hardware. We provide a theoretical and numerical analysis of existing policies and introduce new ones, identifying cases where each is applicable and evaluating their theoretical performance in terms of the number of requested files. In particular, we show that the standard first-in, first-out (FIFO) policy can be arbitrarily inefficient and investigate novel constant-ratio approximations and polynomial-time procedures. If data on the frequency with which each file is accessed is available, we consider a dynamic programming procedure to minimize a stochastic variant of the problem, providing a constant-time approximation for arbitrary file requests. We also investigate a quality criterion based on makespan and explore online variants of the problem. Our numerical analysis, conducted on both synthetic and real-world data from an industry partner, offers insights into when each policy is most appropriate, identifying cases where the proposed algorithms significantly outperform traditional policies, like FIFO, in terms of average reading times. This study has managerial implications, as current data retrieval practices in data centers are often limited to traditional policies with unknown theoretical performance. Our methodological and numerical analysis provides evidence of the value in appropriately sequencing requests based on tape structure, guiding algorithm choice and highlighting underlying trade-offs in response times.</content>

    <title>Expedited Shipping to Meet a Target Service Level: Analytical Recommendations and Behavioral Biases</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Maintaining a high service level with customers involves a fundamental tradeoff between investing in inventory and investing in expediting the shipping of the additional units needed to achieve that service level. We use a multi-method approach to show how and when ordering decisions are influenced by different levels of expediting costs and target service levels. First, we derive a mathematical model that provides a closed-form solution to this tradeoff. Second, we run a behavioral study to show how increments in the expediting cost and the target service level impact buyers’ ordering behavior. Results show that ordering decisions are influenced mainly by the expediting cost. Our econometric estimations provide a generalization of the pull-to-center effect to a setting with expedited shipping. Moreover, we find that buyers adjust their orders only when facing a high target service level. To reduce the observed behavioral biases, we propose that managers can increase the salience of key performance metrics in the buyers’ decision-making process. We test for the role of salience with a second behavioral study and a behavioral model. Results show that the extent to which salient information helps improve buyers’ ordering decisions depends on the level of the expediting cost. Interestingly, our behavioral model highlights how ordering decisions improve not by eliminating people’s biases but by amplifying some of those biases. We contribute to the literature on expedited shipping and behavioral operations, and provide practical recommendations for how managers can improve ordering decisions.</content>

    <title>Quality, Necessity, or Accessibility? Impact of Dockless Bike Sharing on Ineffective Use of Medical Resources</title>
    <updated>2025-02-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, patients have increasing autonomy in medical decision-making. With great autonomy in selecting medical institutions, patients with low-risk diseases may opt for treatment in prestigious hospitals, which limits the access of patients with high-risk diseases to these hospitals. Moreover, due to limited medical knowledge and a fear of uncertainty regarding diseases, patients with greater medical autonomy may request various unnecessary medical tests to alleviate their health-related anxiety. This study takes a novel patients’ perspective to investigate how dockless bike sharing, which addresses the “last-mile problem” and improves geographical accessibility to medical institutions, affects two types of ineffective use of medical resources: disease-institution mismatch and overuse of medical tests. By introducing the concept of quality-accessibility trade-off in patients’ decision-making processes, we shed light on the psychological mechanism underlying the effect of dockless bike sharing on patients’ medical institution choices. We also introduce a new concept, perceived necessity of medical tests, to explain how dockless bike sharing reduces unnecessary medical tests. In Study 1, we designed a quasi-experiment and applied a difference-in-differences model based on real-world electronic health record data to show that dockless bike sharing increased the likelihood of patients choosing hospitals over clinics and decreased the number of unnecessary medical tests. In Studies 2a, 2b, 3a, and 3b, four randomized controlled experiments were employed to replicate the findings and reveal the underlying mechanisms. In sum, we found that dockless bike sharing acted as a “double-edged sword” in terms of its impact on exacerbating disease-institution mismatch and alleviating the overuse of medical tests. This study makes significant theoretical contributions to the Operations Management, sharing economy, and medical resource management literature. It also offers important managerial insights for governments, shared mobility platforms, and healthcare providers.</content>

    <title>Is In-Game Purchase a Guilty Pleasure? Negative Beliefs and Treatment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In-game purchases have become the dominant source of revenue for developers of digital games and are critical to the growth of the digital game industry. However, the distribution of in-game purchases among gamers is highly skewed, where a very small proportion of gamers, labeled “whales,” account for the majority of in-game purchases, and a massive proportion of non-whales spend a minuscule amount. In this study, we explore how to improve in-game purchases by examining gamers’ underlying beliefs. We postulate that compared to spending on other forms of entertainment, in-game purchases suffer from an unusual set of negative beliefs that work against such purchases. We conduct four consecutive studies related to the negative beliefs, propose an approach to mitigate their impact on in-game purchases, and explain the heterogeneous effects of the proposed approach. Specifically, in study 1, we demonstrate the existence of negative beliefs. In Study 2, we identify five key types of negative beliefs. In Study 3, we develop an approach to reduce the negativity of these beliefs and improve gamers’ positive attitudes toward in-game purchases. Lastly, in Study 4, we examine reasons behind heterogeneous results from Study 3 on different gaming platforms and using different revenue models, and design more tailored approaches to incentivize in-game purchases for pay-to-play games and gamers on console platforms. Collectively, the findings in this paper reveal a set of overlooked factors that hinder in-game purchases and introduce a low-cost, effective technique that has the potential to influence gamers’ spending behaviors. Our findings extend beyond a single-game genre or platform and offer potential benefits to the entire digital game industry.</content>

    <title>From Social to Purchase: Customer Selection in Social Group Buying</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social scope group buying has emerged as an increasingly popular promotional strategy and has served as a new customer acquisition tool. In the service industry, companies use social group buying (SGB) to recruit new customers and promote full-price products. Through SGB activities, customers can trade their social capital to form buying groups, experience SGB-offered sample products, and further alleviate uncertainty regarding expensive full-price products before making a final purchase. We investigate this novel SGB phenomenon by examining customers’ decisions throughout the “experience-conversion” process. In collaboration with a leading online educational platform, we examine customers’ grouping behavior during SGB activities and analyze their subsequent purchases. Our analysis reveals an interesting pattern in which non-grouped customers have a higher proportion of full-price product purchases than grouped customers. We postulate that, in addition to observations from operational data, unobserved social information is important for gaining a deeper understanding of the customer behaviors underlying this pattern. Employing a Bayesian learning framework, we model customers’ three-stage discrete-choice decision-making processes and quantify two influential social information factors: social cost and social learning. By incorporating social information, our Bayesian learning model demonstrates improved effectiveness in assisting companies with accurately predicting final purchases in the conversion process. We provide actionable insights into how companies can employ our model to strategically tailor SGB designs by customer segments to increase overall purchase rates. Our study sheds light on the significance of social information in enhancing customer management and refining SGB design.</content>

    <title>Translating Empirical State-Dependent Service Times Into Queueing Models</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent empirical studies suggest that human behavior in queues causes workload-dependent service times. We investigate the translation of empirical service times into state-dependent queueing models. To this end, we identify two types of state-dependent models, static and dynamic, and two types of corresponding behavioral mechanisms. For example, we view customer early task initiation as a static mechanism and social speedup pressure as a dynamic mechanism. For each model type, we discuss behavioral mechanisms consistent with the model assumptions and indicate how empirical service times can be translated into model input parameters. We illustrate how translating service times into dynamic models can result in invalid service rates, which provides evidence against dynamic mechanisms. For dynamic models, we find that mean service times are in general not the inverse of service rates, the directional change in service rates is not always the opposite of the directional change in mean service times, and workload measurement timing can drastically impact mean service time patterns. We provide closed-form equations to convert service times into service rates and vice versa, and find conditions under which monotonic mean service times imply monotonic service rates and vice versa. Our results provide guidelines for researchers to select and specify an appropriate state-dependent queueing model from service time data, and expand the scope of previously published analytical results.</content>

    <title>Unraveling the Impact of Data Breaches: Evidence From the US Healthcare Sector</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As data breaches become an increasingly common risk, they are now a matter of “when” rather than “if.” While there has been active research on breaches, much of the work has focused on the antecedents and prevention of breaches, leaving the quantitative ramifications and variations in breach impact relatively unexplored. To address this gap, our study quantifies the impact of breaches on operational performance and identifies how operational, technological, and market factors moderate the impact. Using a quasi-experimental design with a difference-in-differences technique and propensity score matching, we analyzed a matched sample of 1,766 US hospitals, consisting of 883 breached hospitals and their non-breached peers from 2010 to 2017. We find that breached hospitals experience a 2.1% reduction in hospital admissions and a 0.28% decrease in market share. Moreover, network affiliation, decentralized governance, and cloud-based information technology services negatively moderate breach impacts, while IT security systems for detection, identity governance, and recovery provide mitigating effects. Additionally, we find that breaches in one hospital spillover to affect non-breached hospitals in the same local market. Our findings contribute to the operations management and security literature and provide managerial insights for enhancing breach resilience. Understanding these moderating factors can help hospital managers and policymakers formulate tailored mitigation strategies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article provides a comprehensive overview of the advancements and applications of operations research (OR) and management science (MS) in inventory management described by the Franz Edelman Award finalists from 1985 to 2023. The research presents the transformative potential of OR/MS in addressing complex inventory management challenges across various industries. Through an in-depth examination of the methodologies and solutions employed by these studies, we highlight the strategic implementations of several OR/MS techniques, including simulation-optimization, deep learning and advanced forecasting, dynamic pricing and yield management, and stochastic modeling. The analysis reveals the tangible benefits realized, such as optimized inventory levels, reduced costs, improved profits and revenue, and improved customer satisfaction. This research underscores the critical role of inventory process optimization and risk mitigation in navigating uncertainties and demand fluctuations. The managerial insights derived from these initiatives provide a roadmap for practitioners seeking to implement advanced OR/MS methodologies in real-world inventory management. The findings also encourage the adoption of innovative methods to enhance the operational efficiency and competitiveness. Through this exploration, we aim to stimulate further innovation and research in the evolving field of inventory management and to celebrate the achievements in applied analytics brought forth by the Franz Edelman Award finalists.</content>

    <title>When Platforms Go Public, Standards Drop</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms facilitate the direct exchange of goods, services, or financial transactions between individuals without the involvement of intermediaries. To maintain trust among their user bases, these platforms must implement stringent access controls to determine which users are eligible to participate in their digital marketplace. We argue that when a platform transitions from private to public ownership, it may be incentivized to strategically lower its access standards and admit users who might otherwise have been deemed unqualified. Lowering standards before an initial public offering (IPO) can enable platforms to rapidly increase their user base—and, consequently, enhance their perceived valuation—which could appeal to stock investors and positively influence the IPO price. While this strategy may bolster short-term growth, it could be costly to the platform’s user base. We support this hypothesis using data from two major P2P lending platforms—one that went public and one that remained private. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, we find that the platform preparing for an IPO admitted borrowers who exhibited higher risk levels. Additionally, lenders, in some cases, did not effectively screen out these subpar borrowers and ended up issuing loans to them, leading to higher default rates and lower returns for the lenders. This effect was particularly evident for a specific segment of lenders—namely, those who brokered small-valued loans and loans for necessary purchases (e.g., health emergencies). By contrast, lenders who screened for large-valued loans or loans for discretionary expenditures (e.g., vacations or weddings) were more successful in screening out these subpar borrowers and not issuing loans to them. These results fill a gap in the operations management literature on platform governance by integrating capital-raising objectives into the discussion of access control and operational screening. Our study highlights the nuanced trade-off between quality control and user expansion during capital-raising events, emphasizing both the opportunities and potential inefficiencies that arise in this context.</content>

    <title>Impact of Industrial and Geographical Concentrations of Upstream Industries on Firm Performance During COVID-19</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a large sample of supplier–firm relationships, we develop new measures to operationalize the industrial and geographical concentrations of firms’ upstream industries. The developed measures show an upstream industry might be competitive and contain many suppliers (low industrial concentration) and yet be concentrated in a few countries (high geopolitical concentration) or a small geographical area (high geographical concentration), thus leaving the downstream firm vulnerable to geographical or geopolitical disruptions. Using COVID-19 as an exogenous shock, we document that the firms whose upstream suppliers are operating in industries that have high concentration (either geographically or geopolitically), on average, experienced a reduction of 250 million US dollars in quarterly sales. Thus, competitive industries with ample suppliers may still impose significant risks on downstream firms if the upstream suppliers’ industries are concentrated mainly in a few countries or small geographical areas. Noteworthy, we find evidence that the link between upstream suppliers’ industry-level concentrations and downstream firms’ sales growth is heterogeneous. Specifically, firms can mitigate the negative relationship by adjusting their supply chain networks. The negative relationship is weaker for firms with a geopolitically diversified supply base and firms with more domestic suppliers. Our estimates are robust and consistently identified through several different empirical strategies. Our findings help policymakers and managers to systematically identify locations in supply networks that have the potential to create bottlenecks that may even threaten national security. Additionally, the proposed measures give policymakers insights into which industries to support for onshoring.</content>

    <title>Revisiting Seller Reputation: Impact of Internal and External Reputation on Sales in Online Knowledge Payment Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The emergence of the sharing economy has catalyzed the proliferation of online knowledge payment platforms, empowering individuals possessing untapped knowledge to engage as sellers. Within this landscape, reputation plays a pivotal role in shaping the sales dynamics of knowledge products, which are categorized as credence goods. Unlike conventional sellers, who typically focus on internal reputation-building efforts, knowledge providers have the opportunity to cultivate an external reputation through their professional contributions beyond the platform, potentially influencing sales within it. However, the relative impact of internal and external reputation on driving sales remains uncertain. Our study addresses this gap by investigating the influence of a knowledge provider's internal and external reputation on sales across two phases of live knowledge-sharing lectures—pre and post-live broadcast—using data obtained from a prominent online knowledge payment platform. Our findings reveal that both internal and external reputation positively impact sales during both phases. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the type of product moderates the effect of reputation on sales, with internal reputation exerting a greater influence on sales of hedonic products, while external reputation has a stronger effect on sales of utilitarian products. These discoveries contribute to technology operations management by providing theoretical insights into the formulation and implementation of innovative strategies aimed at enhancing the sales performance of knowledge-based products. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating distinct reputation-building approaches into the design of reputation systems, thereby charting a course toward achieving successful product sales in the realm of online knowledge payment platforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Retail store employees are increasingly being asked to pick orders from inventory. These tasks are performed under intense conditions and are often made more difficult because of high product variety and high degrees of product similarity. We conduct a real-effort task in a virtual environment where subjects must sort cubes into bins. We study task complexity by varying the degree of similarity between the cubes and task intensity by varying the arrival rate of the cube. We focus on four performance metrics: Throughput (number of cubes sorted per minute), Accuracy (percentage of correctly sorted cubes), Productivity (number of correctly sorted cubes per minute), and Error Rate (number of incorrectly sorted cubes per minute). Reducing task complexity increases productivity by as much as 38.2%, and the error rate falls by as much as 93.6%. It also leads to more efficient movements, according to a detailed analysis of our subjects' motion. Increasing task intensity improves throughput but decreases accuracy slightly while varying task intensity improves performance via faster learning. We also observe that subjects tend to cut corners when the task is more complex or more intense.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Choosing the right development team is crucial for companies. We investigate how project collaboration requirements and uncertainty levels affect the choice between “specialists” with higher levels of task-specific abilities and “generalists” with higher levels of collaboration skills. We also examine how these factors affect optimal team incentives. In addition to performance-enhancing helping, we consider another type of collaboration that has received less attention in the incentive literature: information-sharing, which can reduce uncertainty and lead to more compatible design decisions. In the case of helping, we show that if uncertainty is high then specialists might be preferred in order to reduce risk exposure—even if their task-specific abilities are only slightly better. Conversely, if information-sharing can significantly reduce uncertainty then generalists may be favored even if their task-specific abilities are much lower. Our study also reveals that task and collaboration incentives can be either complements or substitutes depending on the type of collaboration and level of project uncertainty: in projects that benefit from helping, firms will always substitute task incentives for collaboration incentives when selecting a team of specialists (rather than a team of generalists), yet this need not be the case with information-sharing. In such projects, it can be optimal to offer higher task incentives and also higher collaboration incentives to a team of specialists (than to a team of generalists) even though specialists’ collaboration skills are relatively lower.</content>

    <title>Equitable Workload Allocation in Vehicle Routing Problem With Heterogeneous Drivers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the private logistics service sector, considerations of fairness among service agents are relatively new but are gaining importance due to public and governmental pressures to improve equity in workload allocation among internal stakeholders, such as the service personnel. Fairness becomes more complex in settings with a heterogeneous workforce due to inherent worker differences. In this study, we present an equitable workload allocation model for the vehicle routing problem with heterogeneous drivers. We adopt the Nash Social Welfare (NSW) solution as the focal point for coalition among the various drivers. In our setup, while the ultimate goal is to maximize the equity and efficiency of drivers, the company’s efficiency is guaranteed by putting a cap on the deviation of the company’s cost from the least-cost solution value. We formulate the problem of last-mile delivery of online orders from a store using a fleet of crowdshippers as a variant of the vehicle routing problem with a highly nonlinear objective function inspired by NSW’s objective function. To solve the proposed new formulation, a column generation method is developed and used to study the behavior of the model. Through a comprehensive computational study, we investigate the behavior of the system in terms of the company’s cost, drivers’ total profit, and the level of achieved equity among the drivers when the main parameters of the problem vary. Our study demonstrates that the proposed framework outperforms the classical max–min approach in balancing workload equity and efficiency. We show a median equity improvement of 18% with a 5% cost deviation and 30% with a 10% deviation from the least-cost solution.</content>

    <title>Two Heads Are Better than One: Task Division and Decision Control in Inventory Planning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine when and how task division improves performance for inventory planning. Specifically, we consider a decentralized inventory management context with two interdependent subtasks: preparing a forecast and setting a service level. Using a behavioral experiment, we reveal that the task challenge moderates the relationship between task division and performance. Our findings indicate that task division improves performance when the task becomes more challenging, such as under high demand uncertainty. It facilitates counteracting behavior, where individuals adjust their decisions to counterbalance their partner's errors, leading to more stabilized final decisions. We identify this counteracting behavior as a critical mechanism driving the benefits of task division, mainly when subtasks are interdependent. We demonstrate the robustness of our findings by examining an egalitarian system, where decision-making authority is shared among team members, and a hierarchical system, where decision control resides entirely with one team member.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite recent theorizing on the power of rhetorical histories, scholars have yet to consider the dynamics of organizational generations (i.e., collectives defined by temporally proximal organizational entry and shared experiences and memories of organizational events) involved in their creation and long-term effects. Based on a comparative case study of two union organizations that participated in failed initiatives, we produce a parallel process model of cross-generational historical branching explaining the divergent and long-term influences of using history strategically across generational lines. Our model unpacks how theoretically distinct forms of what has been deemed “historical myth” offered by senior generations, while harboring similar utility in building cross-generational support, underlie divergent outcomes regarding how members across generations respond to subsequent failure and, in turn, historically position the initiative. We further suggest these processes have a lingering impact on an organization’s willingness to engage in a subsequent initiative. Our theory sheds light on the ways in which historical myths shared across generational divides, in tandem with the cross-generational mnemonic communities they create, engender divergent, long-term, and potentially unexpected consequences.Funding: This work was supported by Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and National Research Foundation of Korea [Grant NRF-2020S1A5A8042404], the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [KAKENHI Grant JP16K17159], and the Yonsei Signature Research Cluster Program [Grant 2024-22-0167].</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Chance constraints, under either known or ambiguous distributions, yield nonconvex feasible regions in general. This paper identifies sufficient conditions that lead to convex feasible regions of chance constraints with Wasserstein ambiguity. Notably, it generalizes the seminal work of other authors, which established the convexity of joint chance constraints under log-concave probability distributions, to the distributionally robust and distributionally optimistic settings.</content>

    <title>A Structural Model of a Firm’s Operating Cash Flow with Applications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Effective management of a firm’s operating cash flow is essential for supporting growth, servicing debt, and maintaining overall financial health. Mismanagement of cash flows can result in severe liquidity challenges and even business failure. However, managing operating cash flow is complex because of its intricate, endogenous relationships with operational variables, like sales, operating costs, inventory, payables, and the impact of exogenous macroeconomic factors on a firm. In this paper, we present a structural model of operating cash flow that untangles this endogeneity, allows us to estimate causal relationships among these variables, and provides a valuable tool for evaluating cash flow management policies. Applying our model to quarterly financial data from S&amp;P’s Compustat database spanning from 1990 to 2020 along with macroeconomic indicators, we provide empirical evidence of the endogenous nature of cash flow with other operational variables. We then showcase the practical value of our model by (i) identifying the characteristics of structural shocks and the new equilibria they induce within the system; (ii) offering a tool for evaluating alternative managerial actions or policy decisions to counteract these shocks; (iii) predicting the impacts of macroeconomic events, such as global recessions and fluctuations in economic sentiment, on firm performance; and (iv) demonstrating superior forecasting performance compared with traditional univariate models. In summary, our structural model of operating cash flow enhances our understanding of its dynamics, enabling better-informed decision making and more effective cash flow management in firms.This paper was accepted by David Simchi Levi, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03790 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a framework for the fundamental valuation of utility tokens. We introduce a requirement that is reminiscent of the cash-in-advance constraint, stipulating that services have to be accessed immediately. Our model endogenizes the velocity of token circulation, yielding a microfounded pricing formula that we calibrate using Ethereum’s adoption data. The equilibrium price path goes through two successive phases: initially, a portion of the tokens are held for purely speculative motives, and later on, all tokens are held with the intention of being used.This paper has been This paper was accepted by Will Cong for the Special Issue on Digital Finance.Funding: This project has benefited from the financial support of the academic chair Blockchain@Polytechnique.

    <title>Long Lags and Large Returns: Experimental Evidence from Advertising to Businesses</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a multiyear experiment, we show that advertising to businesses can generate very different responses than has been observed for consumers. First, we estimate larger advertising returns than typically found for consumers: a return on ad spend of 12.0 (95% CI: 4.8–24.5). Second, we estimate longer lags between ad delivery and purchase: 1–5 months for first-time purchases and 5–12 months or longer for repeat purchases. Third, we find that existing business customers are responsible for most of the revenue lift from advertising, though this appears to be driven by existing business customers purchasing new parts. Additionally, our results demonstrate that geography-based switchback experiments that randomize the time between treatments can provide an effective means of estimating lagged effects. For this study we randomized the delivery of digital display ads for electronic components offered by a semiconductor manufacturer; nearly all electronic products require such components.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Funding: M.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper introduces source theory, a new theory for decision under ambiguity (unknown probabilities). It shows how Savage’s subjective probabilities, with source-dependent nonlinear weighting functions, can model Ellsberg’s ambiguity. It can do so in Savage’s framework of state-contingent assets, permits nonexpected utility for risk, and avoids multistage complications. It is tractable, shows ambiguity attitudes through simple graphs, is empirically realistic, and can be used prescriptively. We provide a new tool to analyze weighting functions: pmatchers. They give Arrow–Pratt-like transformations but operate “within” rather than “outside” functions. We further show that ambiguity perception and inverse S probability weighting, seemingly unrelated concepts, are two sides of the same “insensitivity” coin.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: H.

    <title>EXPRESS: The Slang Paradox: Connecting or Disconnecting with Consumers?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many brands use slang in their marketing communications to connect with consumers. However, through analyses of two Twitter datasets and four experiments, we find that the use of slang in marketing communications could have unintended negative consequences for brands. We theorize and demonstrate that slang use in marketing communications can be perceived as inauthentic because such messages violate consumer expectations, leading to less favorable brand perceptions. To refine our understanding, we test conditions under which slang use aligns more with consumer expectations and is therefore perceived as less inauthentic. Specifically, we find that source characteristics play an important role. First, we show that brand personality impacts this process: Consumers have less favorable attitudes when sincere brands use slang, but not when exciting brands use slang. Second, when influencers (instead of brands themselves) publish brand messages, the negative effect of slang disappears. In addition to contributing new theoretical insights, this research provides practical guidance on effective social media engagement strategies by identifying conditions when slang use is perceived as inappropriate or not in marketing communications.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It has long been a mantra of marketing practice that, particularly in low-involvement situations, spokespeople should be physically attractive. This paper suggests there is a higher probability of gaining fame and influence (i.e., celebrity potential) than is captured by attractiveness or typicality. The authors identify 11 facial features that may predict celebrity potential by virtue of their purported relationship with charisma and resulting personality trait inferences. Using machine learning methods and a sample of 22,000 faces, the authors calculate the direction and strength of the correlation of each feature with celebrity potential. The model is 95.92% accurate in predicting whether a given face belongs to a celebrity or noncelebrity, and it allows calculating a celebrity visual potential (CVP) metric for any face. Two controlled experiments and two studies using photographs of faces of Instagram and LinkedIn users further validate that the model-generated CVP is consistent with human-rated CVP, showing predictive power above and beyond facial typicality and averageness. This paper challenges prior assumptions about the importance of attractiveness in spokesperson choice, offers a useful additional metric for marketers, and provides novel insights about the relative importance of various inferred personality traits for celebrity potential.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With infeed advertising becoming an increasingly popular advertising tool for advertisers to reach mobile consumers, the authors propose an integrated model of contemporaneous, carryover, and spillover effects to measure the incremental contributions of infeed ads in multiple types of mobile apps: newsfeed, social, and video. They empirically examine the three proposed effects of newsfeed ads, social feed ads, and video feed ads using data from a large-scale ad campaign for a new mobile game. The data set contains 10,115,801 impressions, 286,506 clicks, and 12,706 conversions. First, the findings show that social feed ads have the strongest contemporaneous effects on both ad clicks and conversions; social feed ads are 1.87 times more likely to generate a click and 1.69 times more likely to generate a conversion than newsfeed ads, followed by video feed ads (clicks: 1.73 times; conversions: 1.55 times). Second, video feed ads have the strongest carryover effect, followed by social feed ads, while newsfeed ads have a negative carryover effect. Third, newsfeed ads exhibit the strongest spillover effect; prior newsfeed ad exposures are more effective than prior social or video feed ad exposures at promoting clicks and conversions upon subsequent exposure in other channels.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We aim to stimulate discussion on how innovation research within marketing can use a better world (BW) perspective to help innovation become a driver of positive change in the world. In this “Challenging the Boundaries” series paper, we hope to provide purposeful research opportunities for scholars seeking to bridge innovation research with the BW movement. We frame our discussion with four areas of innovation research in marketing that are particularly relevant to BW objectives. We discuss how the innovation process may be disrupted by potentially relinquishing customer centricity and embracing the constraints imposed by BW objectives. We explore how firms should organize for BW innovation, both in terms of who should be involved in the process internally and externally, and how the workforce and firm should be structured to support BW innovation. We then consider consumer response to innovation from a BW perspective, examining drivers of adoption behavior regarding BW innovations and how these innovations should be marketed. We also explore post-adoption behavior, as well as helping consumers resist adoption in certain contexts. Finally, we discuss how markets for BW innovation may be created and sustained, and how external constituencies (i.e., government, lawmakers, and academic communities) could shape these markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The vast amount of content on social media platforms makes it extremely challenging to get posts noticed. An increasingly popular approach to increase customer engagement relies on text overlays, where text is placed directly on images. Such practices raise questions of how to balance the visual and text elements for the best impact. Three key factors, commonly used by practitioners, can trigger engagement because of their visual salience: the degree of dynamism or implied motion in images as well as the size and centrality of the text overlay. With multiple methods, including field studies, online experiments, and managerial interviews, the authors establish that a text overlay that is too large and placed centrally, combined with dynamic images, has negative effects on consumer engagement, because these design combinations make the post look visually unappealing. They also leverage these findings to develop an interactive app that can help managers compose more engaging multimodal social media posts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Climate change adaptation has for a long time been the neglected half of the climate equation, as most attention has been directed toward mitigation. Yet, the catastrophic effects of a changing climate are already occurring, unavoidable, and in many cases irreversible. Organizations need to identify ways of adapting to present and future climatic conditions. In this editorial, we make the case for climate change adaptation as a research topic on par with mitigation. We outline how and why management and organizational scholarship should work toward an integrated approach of mitigation and adaptation in responding to climate change, suggesting three key avenues of research for future inquiry. In so doing, we encourage more impactful and ecologically relevant management research that will make a difference to society at large.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Socioeconomic status (SES)—one’s objective economic and social standing—has the potential to yield critical implications for employee well-being. Despite the vast multidisciplinary literature on the topic, management scholars have historically treated SES as a control variable and have only recently begun to critically examine the role of SES at work. Because of this, relatively little is known about the role that work-specific factors play in the relationship between SES and employee well-being, as well as the role of the socio-environmental context (i.e., understanding who is more vulnerable to health inequalities due to demographics or the environmental contexts in which they operate). To integrate the study of SES more fully into management theory and research, we draw on resource-based theories to develop an organizing framework for reviewing and synthesizing the vast literature on this topic that spans multiple disciplines. In so doing, we unpack the dynamic and reciprocal relationship between SES and employee well-being, elucidating the role that work-specific mechanisms (i.e., job demands and resources) play in linking SES to well-being (and vice versa) and clarifying how these have the potential to amplify or attenuate the effects of SES on well-being. Further, we provide evidence for the role of the socio-environmental context in affecting the aforementioned relationships. We conclude with a critique of the literature, highlighting methodological limitations and opportunities for future research. Ultimately, our hope is for research in management and applied psychology to regard SES not merely as a nuisance variable, but as a subject meriting dedicated inquiry.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Inventory and Supply Chain Planning Systems as Drivers of Supply Chain Resilience: Analyses of Firm Performance through the Covid-19 Pandemic</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We combine insights from information processing theory (IPT), supply chain resilience literature, and collaboration with a leading supply chain planning technology provider to study the effects of excess inventory (a buffering tactic) and usage of supply chain planning systems (SCPS) (a bridging technology) on supply chain resilience. Utilizing the exogenous disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic as the setting for quasi-natural experiments, we compare profit impact and time-to-recover across manufacturing firms that operated with varied levels of inventory and SCPS use in the period leading up to the onset of the pandemic. The results of multiple tests provide no evidence that inventory buffering aided firms in being more resilient, even for firms in industries that experienced positive demand shocks in the pandemic. In contrast, we find that firms that used SCPS evidenced fewer negative financial impacts throughout the disruptive period, and they recovered faster than their peers. The results are robust to sample characteristics, time frame, and control-group matching procedures. Our study extends a growing literature on supply chain resilience by offering a more refined explanation of IPT in a disruptive context, highlighting the limitations of inventory as a buffering tactic, and describing how SCPS help planners cope with uncertainty and disruptions. In addition, interviews with managers from a leading SCPS provider and from user firms highlight specific ways in which SCPS provide faster and more effective responses to disruptions. We discuss the implications of these findings for future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Utilizing the introduction of the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) as an exogenous shock to enhance secondary bond market transparency, we investigate the informational feedback effect of the bond market on supplier innovation in vertical relationships. We find that the increased availability of trading details regarding major customers’ outstanding bonds significantly fosters their supplier firms’ innovative investment. This positive effect of bond market transparency enhancements on supplier innovation is weakened when major customers demonstrate a better information environment, have higher levels of institutional ownership, and share common institutional investors with suppliers, while strengthened when the bond market conveys positive information about major customers, and when major customers face tighter financial constraints, exhibit higher levels of risk-taking, and possess greater importance to suppliers. Our findings clearly identify the informational role of the bond market in corporate investment decisions and specifically highlight the importance of bond market information regarding customer firms to the innovation along the supply chain.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Are All Generic Drugs Created Equal? An Empirical Analysis of Generic Drug Manufacturing Location and Serious Drug Adverse Events</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generic drugs provide lifesaving, affordable treatment to millions of people each day. Generic drug manufacturing has been steadily moving from advanced economies, such as the U.S., to emerging economies, such as India. Due to the opacity of drug supply chains, the quality risk implications of manufacturing in emerging economies has not been carefully empirically tested. This study addresses this gap. To do so, we identify a novel source of drug manufacturing location data which allows us to compare the occurrence of serious adverse events of generic drugs made in different locations. Using exact matching analyses based on the equivalency criteria established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), we find that generic drugs manufactured in India, where a majority of emerging economy generic drugs are made, are associated with significantly higher instances of serious adverse events than equivalent generic drugs made in the U.S., where a majority of advanced economy generic drugs are made. We further show that this key result is explained by mature generic drugs, which are particularly susceptible to operations and supply chain cost reduction efforts—efforts that unfortunately may compromise drug quality. Our study finding leads to implications for the FDA in their regulation of generic drugs.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Managing Reusable Resources with Usage Time Limits</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In reusable resources like vehicle sharing, city parking, and hotel services, resource units are used by consecutive customers for a stochastic usage time and are made available for future customers upon return. We model such reusable resources as Erlang loss systems, where customers who find all units occupied are blocked. Customers are rational decision-makers, and their willingness to join the system depends on factors such as price, time limits, service value, and resource availability. When each customer is charged a fixed price, we examine whether it is beneficial to install time limits, which increase availability at the expense of reduced usage time. We formulate and solve a two-dimensional revenue maximization problem to optimize both the usage price and the time limit. We differentiate between on-demand resources, which are immediately reusable upon return, and reserved resources, which can only be reused after the time limit expires. With on-demand resources, setting a time limit is proven to be detrimental, making the entry price the sole tool for maximizing revenue. This conclusion remains valid when the usage time increases with the entry price. In contrast, managing reserved resources involves an interplay between time limits and entry prices. Additionally, we show that loss systems (where customers do not wait) should be managed differently from systems where customers do wait. Specifically, in systems with waiting, we prove that only the time limit should be optimized, while the entry price should capture the full market share. We prove our results by analyzing the behavior of the equilibrium arrival rate and revenue, which necessitates establishing novel properties for the blocking probability. These properties yield new sharp bounds for the blocking probability and enable us to prove the convergence of the optimized model for on-demand resources to the QED regime as the number of resource units grows.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: When a Mighty Competitor Comes to Town, Can Adjusting Product Variety Shield Incumbent Stores from Sales Loss? Insights from Retail Collocation, Category, and Pre-Existing Competition</title>
    <updated>2025-02-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When a competitor enters a market, incumbent retail stores often adjust their product variety to maintain sales. However, no empirical evidence has been provided in the literature to justify the value of such product variety adjustments after a rival’s entry. One difficulty is that the change in consumer demand due to rival’s entry and changes in product variety simultaneously affect incumbents’ sales. When changes in sales at incumbent stores are observed after rivals’ entries, it is unclear whether the sales changes result from product variety adjustments or changes in consumer demand directly resulting from the entry. Even if adjusting product variety can potentially mitigate sales loss due to rivals’ entries, it is unclear whether such product variety adjustments provide a universal solution to all incumbent stores. This paper applies the difference-in-difference research design to develop a system of equations for product variety and sales at incumbent stores after rivals’ entries by exploiting the entries of warehouse clubs. The findings reveal that, on average, product variety at incumbent stores increased after the entries. This increased product variety mitigates the sales decreases caused by the entries with a diminishing return. After the entry of a warehouse club store, incumbent stores collocated with the new store have less sales loss than the non-collocated stores due to the trade-off between the substitution and agglomeration effects. Product variety adjustments at collocated incumbent stores experience greater sales benefits than non-collocated stores. Moreover, the sales loss that was mitigated by increased product variety at incumbent stores within the retail category of entrants is larger than others after the entry of a warehouse club store. Interestingly, the mitigation effect is not significant for certain incumbents, such as convenience and drug stores, which belong to different retail categories from entrants. This study also explores the heterogeneous effects by investigating pre-existing competition and different warehouse club chains. The empirical findings offer valuable insights to managers of incumbent stores on how to adjust product variety to reduce sales loss resulting from a rival’s entry.</content>

    <title>Making Delivery Platform Drivers Safer: Platform Responsibility Versus Consumer Empowerment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The increasing frequency of traffic accidents involving food delivery drivers has raised public concern about the safety of fast delivery services. In response, food delivery platforms have introduced two corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategies to enhance drivers’ road safety: One in which the platform assumes full responsibility for extending delivery times and another that empowers consumers to decide on extended delivery times. Additionally, policymakers are mandating that platforms purchase employment injury insurance for their drivers. Despite these efforts, debates continue over how platforms should adjust delivery times to mitigate driver risk and whether new driver protection policies are truly effective. In this study, we employ the Hotelling model to examine a duopoly food delivery market in which consumers are socially responsible, time-sensitive, and exhibit heterogeneous loyalty to competing platforms. Building on the consumer empowerment framework, we investigate the optimal CSR strategy choices for these platforms and assess the resulting impacts on various stakeholders. Our analysis provides three key insights. First, we demonstrate that offering differentiated extended delivery time options can mitigate the negative impact of consumer aversion to empowerment on platform profitability, especially in markets with a significant consumer heterogeneity in time sensitivity. Second, we identify a potential all-win CSR outcome, wherein positively shaping consumer attitudes benefits all stakeholders, a possibility often overlooked in practice. Third, we surprisingly find that the widely adopted protective measure, namely the mandatory insurance policy (MIP), does not effectively mitigate driver risk. In contrast, our proposed risk-based MIP addresses this limitation and allows consumers who actively participate in CSR initiatives to benefit from a lower markup on delivery fees. These insights offer a refined analytical framework for understanding consumer empowerment, providing valuable guidance for researchers, platform operations managers, and policymakers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Reverse factoring (RF) is a highly relevant form of supply chain finance. Whereas extant analytical studies indicate how RF should enable buyers to extend payment terms, sufficient empirical evidence is lacking. To hypothesize on payment term extensions, we study three motives—financing cost, fairness, and standardization. Our empirical evidence indicates the presence of all three. It extends former analytical work on RF adoption revolving around sthe financing cost motive only.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The proliferation of fake news, more recently multimodal fake news, poses a significant threat to individuals, organizations, and society. While online social media platforms have employed automated methods to combat fake news, they face two notable challenges: the scarcity of labeled data and the diversity of news domains. To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of online platforms in mitigating the spread of fake news, this study proposes MT-GPD (Multimodal Deep Transfer learning with Gating network, model Patch, and Domain classifier) for cross-domain fake news detection. MT-GPD integrates three novel design artifacts as auxiliary mechanisms for enhancing multimodal deep transfer learning, including a gating network that captures the relative importance of textual and visual components of individual news articles for dynamic fusion; a customized model patch that balances detection performance and computational efficiency; and a domain classifier that adapts multimodal representations to a target news domain. We evaluate the performance of MT-GPD using news datasets spanning four different domains. The results demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of MT-GPD, providing strong evidence for the impacts of the proposed auxiliary mechanisms on improving fake news detection performance.</content>

    <title>When Lives Are at Stake: Managing Temporal Complexity with a Strategy Process Repertoire</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Humanitarian organizations assisting victims of armed conflict face fragmented and potentially conflicting temporal demands on strategy making. Annual donor funding requires detailed planning, unpredictable outbreaks of war and violence demand quick and flexible decisions, and long-term societal challenges must be addressed over the next decades. Few studies have examined how organizations can achieve temporal fit in such temporally complex environments without accepting internal fragmentation or decoupling from certain temporal demands. We draw on a longitudinal case study of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), a humanitarian organization with the mandate to aid victims of armed conflict, to explore this gap. We find that the ICRC has developed a repertoire of multiple distinct strategy processes tailored to the fragmented temporal demands. These processes include emergency responses, strategic planning, and long-term strategizing. Although each strategy process retained its distinctiveness, their loose coupling ensured a sufficient alignment of resource allocation in pursuit of the organization’s humanitarian mandate. Strong shared principles and an episodic activation of strategy processes helped to manage the inherent complexity of loose coupling. Thus, strategy process repertoires may form a capability supporting strategic decision making in temporally complex environments. Our study contributes to strategy process research by introducing loose coupling as a mechanism for integrating multiple strategy processes with different temporalities, complementing previous studies on strategy processes as a tightly coupled structural context. Furthermore, we advance theorizing on ambitemporality by analyzing how the loose coupling of internal temporal structures may help organizations cope with temporal complexity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a world where five stars have become the standard for evaluating many transactions, and consumers turn to the crowd for guidance when making a wide variety of choices, organizations cannot dismiss online reviews as inconsequential. And while we know a lot about how organizations respond to reviews online, there has been a lack of systematic evidence showing how organizations behave in response to online feedback once their screens are turned off. This paper leverages a novel combination of insights from a lab-in-the-field experiment, an archival study, and two rounds of qualitative interviews in the French restaurant industry to examine online and offline responses to reviewer feedback. We identify characteristics of the review, the restaurant, and the respondent that influenced when restaurants in our sample were more likely to align their actions online and offline, and when they were more likely to decouple them—i.e., posting an online response promising to take corrective action while having no intention to change how the restaurant operates “in real life”. We conclude by speculating on potential mechanisms behind our respondents’ reactions, and discussing our contribution to literature on producer reactivity and the symbolic management of change.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a theoretical framework and provide empirical evidence on how resource complementarity or substitutability between entrepreneurs and seed investors drives selection and value creation in the context of high-tech startups. Specifically, we argue that seed investors specialized in training programs - startup accelerators - are the ideal match for entrepreneurial teams equipped with strong technological competencies but lacking business knowledge. On the other hand, when entrepreneurs with extensive business knowledge pair up with accelerators, the value created is typically less. Combining information from Crunchbase and LinkedIn, we provide robust empirical evidence based on the assortative matching of startups and investors and the ex-post analysis of joint value creation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The recently introduced and highly practical class of deferred acceptance clock auctions offers a unique combination of desirable properties, including obvious strategy-proofness, unconditional winner privacy, and transparency. Early excitement around these auctions was dampened due to a result demonstrating that no deterministic and prior-free clock auction can guarantee better than a logarithmic approximation of the optimal social welfare, even in simple settings. In “Bayesian and Randomized Clock Auctions,” Feldman, Gkatzelis, Gravin, and Schoepflin reignite this excitement by demonstrating that one can achieve improved results for a wide class of instances if a clock auction can either use randomization or has access to prior information. The authors provide three different clock auctions that achieve these improved guarantees given access to different amounts of prior information, exhibiting how additional information can further simplify the auction design.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a measure of the speed of firm-level information diffusion, study how it is affected by limited attention, and examine its effect on real corporate decisions. Using local flu epidemics as exogenous attention shocks, we show that inattention from dual-covering analysts and cross-holding institutions reduces the speed of information diffusion from customer to supplier stock prices. We find that the speed of information diffusion along the supply chain affects the price feedback effect for corporate investment decisions and facilitates coordination between customers and suppliers. Our findings demonstrate that coattention from key market participants affects information efficiency and generates real economic outcomes.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: L.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prosocial behavior research has historically considered altruistic or self-interested motives as the primary drivers for charitable giving. Recently, however, there have been many high-profile cases wherein consumers use their donations to harm others. We define this behavior, characterized by a desire for retribution resulting from witnessing or experiencing volitional wrongdoing, as “retributive philanthropy” and examine this phenomenon using a multi-method approach. Qualitative interviews with perpetrators and targets of retributive philanthropy reveal key themes of blameworthiness judgments, strong negative affect, and a desire to harm as a terminal goal of donation—all of which are not typically associated with prosocial behaviors. Analysis of real-world anti-vaccine protestor donation data find similar themes of perceived wrongdoing and outrage related to retributive donations in a large-scale context. Five lab studies and five supplementary studies then demonstrate the effects of perceived volitional wrongdoing, harm, efficacy, and authoritarianism on willingness to make retributive donations. Together, these findings offer critical insight into an emerging mode of donation that is emotionally, motivationally, and behaviorally distinct from traditional prosocial behavior and has important implications for consumers and charitable marketers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Effect of Gender-Neutral Marketing on Consumer Attribute Preference</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As consumer demand for gender inclusivity grows, numerous brands are actively embracing gender-neutral communication and practices to signal their commitment to inclusivity. While companies generally assume gender-neutral marketing (i.e., efforts that explicitly reject binary gender categorization and stereotypes) nets favorable benefits, this research uncovers an unintended consequence of this marketing practice on consumer attribute preference. Specifically, the authors find that gender-neutral marketing decreases consumers’ reliance on aesthetics in product evaluations by reducing their endorsement of binary gender stereotypes in their decision making. Eight pre-registered studies—including field experiments, an eye-tracking study, and lab and online experiments—provide triangulating evidence for these propositions. The authors also identify three boundary conditions by revealing that the effect is less pronounced when the brand exhibits a prominent binary gender personality, among consumers who primarily rely on visual elements in their information processing, and when the target product is expected to be used in a social context. These findings deepen our understanding of how Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in marketing shape consumer behavior and provide valuable insights for managers seeking to implement gender-neutral marketing tactics.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: To Acquire or to Ally? the Impact of Strategic Emphasis on Governance Mode Choice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In pursuit of growth, firms often rely on outside options and choose a specific governance mode (acquisitions or alliances) to manage their external partnerships. In such pursuits, a firm’s strategic emphasis, i.e., relative focus on value appropriation vs. value creation, could be crucial in determining appropriate governance mode choice. In this paper, the authors draw on transaction cost economics and the resource-based view to articulate and empirically assess the impact of strategic emphasis on governance mode choice using a large panel of publicly listed US firms. They also identify and test two boundary conditions, namely CMO presence and analyst coverage of the firm. The results indicate that firms with a greater strategic emphasis on value appropriation relative to value creation are more likely to prefer acquisitions over alliances. Further, the positive impact of strategic emphasis on the likelihood of choosing acquisitions over alliances is weakened both with CMO presence and with increasing analyst coverage of the firm. These results provide insights on how a firm’s strategic emphasis might impact its choice of governance mode, in the presence of CMO and analyst coverage.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how different stakeholders perceive influencer authenticity, revealing the misalignments that arise when each group prioritizes different aspects of authenticity. In doing so, the authors generate new theory on influencer marketing and provide managerial insights for brands and agencies to collaborate effectively with influencers to resolve these misalignments and ultimately build and sustain influencer authenticity. Using exploratory, in-depth interviews with consumers, influencers, brand managers, and influencer marketing agencies, the study triangulates stakeholder perspectives on influencer authenticity. Specifically, it examines the misalignment among these groups through the lens of assemblage theory and explores how these misalignments may be resolved to produce successful and lasting influencer assemblages. Finally, it explores how influencer marketing agencies can help manage authenticity misalignments.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Sales Pipeline Technology: Automated Lead Nurturing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many business-to-business sales firms use automated lead nurturing (ALN) systems, which track leads’ online behavior and nurture them through personalized content. ALN software providers claim that ALN improves lead conversion, but whether this benefit materializes is unclear. Therefore, this research examines ALN’s effect across one qualitative and three quantitative studies. The findings indicate that ALN can provide valuable information to both sellers and leads and thereby improve the quality of salesperson–lead interactions, which in turn drives lead conversion. On average, ALN increases the probability of lead conversion between 0 (Studies 1, 3) and 23 (Study 2) percentage points. However, these effects strongly depend on a lead’s sales cycle length, expected sales volume, and preexisting relationship with the seller. Thereby, this article conducts the first rigorous “fact check” of ALN and provides evidence that understanding the effect of ALN requires a contingency view. The findings also call on practitioners to change their current practices related to ALN. Rather than accepting industry claims at face value, practitioners should verify whether ALN improves lead conversion in their specific context. Furthermore, they should employ ALN particularly for leads where information asymmetry persists and is unlikely to be resolved through other, more costly means.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Effect of Company Size on Aggregate Word of Mouth Valence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online word of mouth (WOM) is a critical driver of consumer purchases; however, relatively few researchers have sought to understand how a company’s characteristics might impact aggregate WOM valence (e.g., average star ratings of online reviews). The authors examine the effects of one such attribute—company size—and how it impacts WOM valence through individuals’ decisions regarding whether to engage in WOM. In four field studies, the authors find a negative relationship between company size and WOM that persists when controlling for the quality of consumers’ experience with the company. Subsequent experiments show that this effect occurs because consumers are more empathetic toward smaller companies. This empathy increases their desire to help smaller companies, which in turn increases the likelihood that they share WOM about a smaller company following a high-quality experience and decreases this likelihood in the case of a low-quality experience. Larger companies can mitigate the negative effect on aggregate WOM valence by responding frequently to WOM posts and employing language that evokes empathy—for example, by using emotional words, providing personalized responses, and addressing consumers by name.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Displaying the Amount of Consumption Time in Online Reviews Can Affect Helpful Votes</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Some review platforms display how long reviewers used a product alongside their review. The authors investigate whether doing so translates to more helpful reviews. Using online reviews of video games from a video game platform and leveraging its unique playtime tracking feature, they find the relationship between the amount of time playing a game before posting a review and the number of helpful votes the review receives follows a u-shape, where shorter and longer playtimes correspond to more votes, while intermediate times correspond to fewer votes. How displayed consumption time affects consumer expectations potentially explains this relationship. The less time reviewers spend consuming a product, the lower others’ expectations of review helpfulness may be and hence the more lenient their judgements. More consumption time may increase these expectations, but extensive consumption time could overcome this higher bar by signaling credibility. Moderation results related to reviewer experience signaling and review or product characteristics, as well as mediation results involving consumer-gifted review awards help support this context-based expectations account. These results are robust to conditioning out review, reviewer, and game level factors, sample matching, and other settings. The findings have implications for reducing the asymmetric information problem, managing expectations, and optimizing reviews.</content>

    <title>Theorizing Waste as a Technique of Power in Capitalistic Stakeholder Relations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Waste is an important socio‐ecological challenge of contemporary capitalism, contributing to climate change and environmental degradation. Despite its pervasiveness and its impacts on diverse stakeholders, it yet remains largely underexplored in management and organization studies. Addressing this gap, this paper investigates waste's crucial role in shaping specific stakeholder relations by theorizing it as a technique of power. By examining the case of a socio‐ecological crisis in Naples, Italy, characterized by illegal waste practices linked to Mafia organizations, we unpack two entangled techniques of power:commodifying waste– transforming it into something that can be traded on a market and perpetuating its exploitation; andignoring waste– involving failing or refusing to consider and recognize waste. Our findings elucidate how these two techniques produced and reinforced socio‐ecological hierarchies, in which local stakeholders were wasted. By highlighting the lived experiences of local communities affected by waste, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of power dynamics among diverse stakeholders in socio‐ecological crises and demonstrates how waste functions as a mechanism of dispossession within capitalist accumulation.</content>

    <title>Are Family Owners Willing to Risk “Rocking the Boat”? A Blended Socioemotional Wealth-Implicit Theory Framework</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage research on socioemotional wealth (SEW) and implicit theories to develop a novel blended SEW-implicit theory framework that explains why some family firms are more risk seeking or more risk averse. According to implicit theory, individuals perceive reality through their interpretative cognitive filters. Those with an entity theory orientation see reality as relatively fixed or uncontrollable, while those with an incremental-implicit theory orientation tend to perceive reality as malleable and change as leading to positive outcomes. We theorize that family firms with high SEW intensity tend to adopt an entity orientation, whereas those with low SEW intensity tend to adopt an incremental orientation. Accordingly, we propose that the likelihood that family owners hold either orientation is shaped by organizational features associated with SEW intensity, namely (a) the salience of family versus business identity, (b) family founder imprinting, (c) generational stage, and (d) favorable path dependence. In turn, family owners with an entity orientation are less likely to take risks compared to family owners with an incremental orientation. Furthermore, we theorize that a firm’s performance hazard can shift family owners’ implicit orientation from entity-based to incremental and vice versa, thereby impacting their risk-taking behavior.</content>

    <title>Gains from Product Variety: Evidence from a Large Digital Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digital platforms can increase product variety and consumer choice by facilitating the discovery and availability of new products. In this paper, we document the massive growth of new products on the largest digital platform in China and quantify the welfare implications for consumers. Using sales data on three categories of books from 2015 and 2019, we find that the number of product titles almost doubles, whereas prices fall somewhat. Most of the new products are niche offerings that exhibit less elastic demand. Accounting for the niche nature of new products generates welfare gains 40 times larger than those from lower prices and 30% higher than existing estimates that do not distinguish between mass and niche products. We also examine the geographic variation in these gains and find that consumers in rural and low-income regions enjoy greater benefits from increased variety. The findings emphasize that expanding niche product offerings may outperform price reductions in generating consumer benefits. Policymakers are encouraged to support e-commerce development in underserved regions to harness the inclusive growth enabled by digital platforms.</content>

    <title>Tech‐Enabled Inclusion: Leveraging Social Media to Empower Neurodivergent Employees in the Workplace</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Neurodivergent employees (NDEs) are characterized by different neurological profiles, including but not limited to autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Tourette syndrome, face underrepresentation, and undervaluation at work. This review employs the technology affordance lens and a diversity and inclusion model to explore how social media (SM) can facilitate the inclusion of NDEs. We propose a technology‐inclusion framework as a foundation for future model testing by delineating the key variables and relationships at play. A narrative review is adopted to discuss our findings derived from a comprehensive search of relevant literature, which yielded 41 journal articles and five book chapters. We employed thematic analysis, facilitated by ATLAS.ti's artificial intelligence coding function, to critically review and analyze the shortlisted articles through a rigorous, iterative process. Our framework highlights three pathways (NDE‐related, leader‐related, and peer‐related) that discuss the combination of SM affordances enhancing and inhibiting the inclusion of NDEs. In particular, SM affordances can build inclusion by enhancing self‐efficacy and a sense of empowerment, facilitating accessible communication, and connection. However, privacy and personal safety concerns explain why SM affordances sometimes undermine inclusion. Likewise, pathways related to supervisory support, and increased interactions and support from peers highlight the role of leaders and peers in translating SM affordances to NDEs' inclusion. We emphasize that leveraging SM applications, understanding NDEs' specific needs, and fostering an inclusive culture starting from organizational leadership can significantly contribute to promoting inclusion and support for NDEs in the workplace.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Configurational research has great promise in entrepreneurship. There are few universal laws or relationships that hold under all circumstances. More often, optimal entrepreneurial outcomes are contingent on many factors. Consequently, configurational analysis using qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) has become increasingly popular. However, methodological research in sociology and political science has raised concerns about possible false positive findings produced by this method. In this editorial, we explore the potential and the common pitfalls of QCA in entrepreneurship research, as well as guidelines for its use.</content>

    <title>Riding the Passion Wave or Fighting to Stay Afloat? A Theory of Differentiated Passion Contagion</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research suggests that employees benefit from highly passionate teammates because passion spreads easily from one employee to the next. We develop theory to propose that life in high-passion teams may not be as uniformly advantageous as previously assumed. We suggest that high-passion teams also evoke pressures that lead employees to expend effort to increase their levels of passion, which negates the benefits the team provides. We first conducted an experience-sampling study at an engineering company involved in the production and maintenance of critical infrastructure that benefits the greater good, with 829 employees nested in 155 teams, which we surveyed three times per day for 20 consecutive work days. These data show that employees caught their teammates’ passion and consequently reported better performance, lower emotional exhaustion, and a stronger sense of social connection. However, these benefits coexisted alongside costs employees incurred that were associated with increasing their passion. In a subsequent pre-registered experiment ( N = 1,063), we provide causal evidence for these effects and their underlying mechanism, finding that passion contagion is particularly effort-laden—more so than contagion of other states and increases in passion that are not the result of contagion. We develop a theory of differentiated passion contagion that exposes the effort inherent in contagion and the implications of that effort. Our work suggests that passion caught from others may hold less value than passion incited from within, and shifts our understanding of when and why passion for work is beneficial and detrimental. We also discuss implications for broader emotional contagion theory.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates how competition for scarce corporate resources impacts innovation incentives within multidivisional firms and, consequently, shapes firms’ preferences for fostering or restricting intra-firm competition. In our model, divisions become privately informed about the potential value of new investment opportunities generated through their innovation initiatives. We demonstrate that intra-firm competition unambiguously reduces divisions’ex anteinnovation incentives. However, it benefits ex post resource allocation by enabling the firm to (i) select the most promising project and (ii) limit the rents divisions earn from their private information. Consequently, a firm’s preference to limit or encourage interdivisional competition hinges on balancingex postallocative efficiency, which favors increased intra-firm competition, againstex anteinnovation incentives, which favor reduced competition. Our analysis identifies plausible conditions under which each organizational design—competitive or exclusive innovation—emerges as the optimal choice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a measure of local long-run growth prospects, I uncover a novel link between economic fundamentals and house prices. Whereas excess housing returns are positively associated with economic growth prospects, housing valuations are negatively associated with shocks to growth prospects. I document an explanation in metro-area consumption: housing consumption is asymmetrically exposed to economic prospects in that it expands more quickly when prospects are strong than it contracts when prospects are poor. I explain these findings through the lens of an asset pricing model that focuses on a trade-off between nonseparable committed housing and nonhousing consumption.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: Data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01996 .</content>

    <title>Upward Influencers in Teams</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Upward influencers, employees who are more favorably perceived by their supervisors than their peers and subordinates, are predicted by economic and accounting theories and are found to be ubiquitous in many organizations. Despite their prevalence, the role of upward influencers in teams remains underexplored. This paper fills this void by using proprietary data from a service‐providing organization that allows for the identification of upward influencers based on its 360‐degree person evaluation. We find an inverted U‐shaped relationship between the fraction of upward influencers in a team and team performance. In cross‐sectional analyses, we show that this relationship is driven by conditions when the need for collaboration and information sharing is high and when managers are less experienced. Additional tests exploring the mechanisms for the role of upward influencers in teams suggest that they impair team horizontal relationships through lowering the willingness to communicate, share knowledge, and offer mutual assistance among team members. Yet, teams with upward influencers build better vertical relationships with supervisors, which, in return, is associated with supervisors allocating more of their time to provide team members with feedback and guidance. Taken together, this study contributes to the understanding of upward influencers in teams.</content>

    <title>Do Reductions in Search Costs for Partial Information on Online Platforms Lead to Better Consumer Decisions? Evidence of Cognitive Miser Behavior from a Natural Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online platforms increasingly utilize technologies like artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered tools to reduce consumers’ search costs and simplify decision making. However, these tools often target specific types of information, leading to what we term "search cost reduction for partial information." Although designed to assist consumers, our study highlights their unintended consequence: these tools can induce "cognitive miser" behavior, where consumers focus on easily accessible information while neglecting other critical details. This behavior can ultimately result in poorer decision making. Using a natural experiment on Yelp, we evaluated the impact of its AI-powered image categorization feature, introduced in 2015 to reduce the search costs of review images. Through a difference-in-differences design and text analysis of consumer complaints, we found that this feature negatively affected decision quality. These findings carry important implications for platform managers and policymakers. Although search cost reduction tools can improve efficiency, they also risk biasing consumer attention toward easily accessible information at the expense of holistic decision making. Online platforms could mitigate these effects by complementing AI-empowered search cost reduction features with tools that emphasize information requiring greater cognitive effort, thereby ensuring balanced consumer awareness. We recommend that platform designers carefully evaluate the broader impacts of such tools to better support consumer decision making.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the association between CEO birthplace proximity and financial misconduct. We find that CEOs managing firms near their birthplaces (home CEOs) are associated with less financial misconduct compared to other CEOs. This association is not attributable to differences in corporate governance. The relationship strengthens in areas with a strong local investment presence and greater religious commitment as well as among CEOs with longer tenures in their home state. Our findings are robust to addressing potential selection and omitted variable biases as well as to conducting multiple robustness tests, including analyses of involuntary CEO changes and headquarters relocations. We also find a similar association for CFOs, with firms employing home CFOs exhibiting less financial misconduct.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Technological developments – particularly related to artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and digitalization – are disrupting the workplace in unprecedented ways, particularly in professional and knowledge‐intensive sectors. Scholars' views on the implications of these disruptions range from optimism and pessimism to scepticism. Disciplines vary in how extensively they have considered the implications of these technological developments. With much prior work focusing on the more macro‐level phenomena and effects, the role of institutions, organizations and individuals – as well as their interrelatedness – remains less examined. In this introductory article to the special issue, we discuss the scope, extent and new domains of change related to the Future of Work and, especially, to AI. We also reflect on the consequences of these changes as well as the related processes and mechanisms through which they will manifest. Then, we introduce and summarize the articles included in this special issue along the above dimensions. We conclude by reflecting on the overall contribution of the special issue and on future directions for examining the Future of Work from the perspective of management studies.</content>

    <title>Plain Sailing or Choppy Water? Maintaining Interpersonal Trusting Relationships in Times of Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Interpersonal trusting relationships frequently experience relational threats that require both parties to engage actively in trust maintenance efforts. Yet, trust research has tended to focus on trust formation, or trust repair in the case of a violation, and offers us little insight regarding how these more ambiguous threats to trusting relationships are experienced and overcome relationally. To provide novel insight on this topic, this exploratory study gathers dyadic interview data from 26 manager–employee trusting relationships regarding their experience of relational threats and their proactive efforts to overcome these negative relational experiences. Findings show that the experience of a relational threat triggers a three-stage trust maintenance process that includes an assessment phase, an active maintenance phase, and an outcome phase. Threats are assessed at the individual level via cognitive and affective sensemaking, while trust maintenance efforts (creating a shared mental model, cognitive and structural reassurance, and dyadic problem solving) require dyadic counterparts to act with mutual agency to overcome the relational threat and avoid a loss of trust. Trust maintenance processes support dyads to either maintain or strengthen their existing trusting relationships. Our findings advance our theoretical understanding of interpersonal trust maintenance by demonstrating that this process unfolds across three phases and can lead to different outcomes for dyads’ trusting relationships. We offer practical guidelines to safeguard existing trusting relationships, as well as a new agenda for trust scholars to extend our theorizing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The lead independent director (LID) position was adopted primarily to increase the efficiency of the monitoring function of the board. However, evidence of whether and how LIDs influence board monitoring has been limited. We apply and test the theoretical quad model in the context of the LID to examine whether selecting a qualified LID helps improve monitoring within the board. We argue that when a board appoints a qualified LID, it improves overall board monitoring, along with board meeting facilitation and interpersonal interactions between the board and shareholders. Using a sample of US firms, we find that firms that appoint qualified LIDs tend to have lower levels of corporate misconduct, better board meeting attendance, and fewer shareholder proposals.Managerial SummaryThis study explores the impact of selecting a qualified lead independent director (LID) on corporate governance, highlighting practical benefits for firms that prioritize strong board leadership. Our findings show that appointing a well‐qualified LID can enhance board effectiveness by reducing incidents of corporate misconduct, improving board meeting attendance, and decreasing shareholder activism. These results underscore the importance of careful LID selection as a strategic move to strengthen governance, ensure robust oversight, and improve communication with stakeholders. This research provides actionable insights for boards seeking to bolster governance practices by strategically leveraging the LID position.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article analyzes how innovation country‐of‐origin impacts the decisions of multinational corporations (MNCs) to defend their patents against infringement in foreign countries. We argue that MNCs have stronger incentives to defend their locally generated innovations (in foreign countries) than their home‐ or third‐country generated innovations (that have been transferred to foreign countries) because of the higher risk for knowledge spillovers for locally generated innovations. We also explore whether a higher level of multimarket overlap in knowledge activities with industry rivals increases MNC decisions to defend their best innovations. We examine data on infringement cases brought by foreign firms operating in the United States and find results consistent with our expectations. Additionally, when split by patents' country‐of‐origin, our findings reveal several interesting differences.Managerial SummaryThis article examines how several characteristics of firm innovations influence knowledge spillover risks and the decisions of MNCs to defend their patents against infringement in foreign countries.  We argue that locally generated patents and those patents that are more important (in terms of value and usage) or more exposed to rivals are more likely to be defended against infringement in foreign countries.  Using data on firms in high tech industries and their patent infringement cases, we show support for our arguments while also revealing several interesting differences across the litigation decisions of MNCs when considering the patents' country‐of‐orign.</content>
