    <title>Born to Wait? A Study on Allocation Rules in Booking Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Queue-based rules for allocating scarce goods are widely utilized in booking systems due to their perceived efficiency. However, empirical investigations into the externalities and opportunity costs of queuing in multitasking scenarios are limited. This paper reports on two laboratory experiments that compare a queue-based rule with a lottery-based rule by quantifying their respective efficiency losses. Our findings indicate that while the queue-based rule demonstrates superior allocative efficiency, it incurs significant losses in productive efficiency attributed to opportunity costs of time. In contrast, the lottery-based rule exhibits improved overall efficiency with minimal time spent on the booking system. Additionally, under the queue-based rule, participants display bimodal behavior, either engaging fully or abstaining from the booking system, influenced by their time valuations. Furthermore, while providing queue length information facilitates more efficient coordination, it also leads to more frequent task-switching behavior that negates any productive efficiency gained from improved coordination. This research underscores the crucial need to reevaluate allocation mechanisms in booking systems, taking into account their externalities.</content>

    <title>Faster Deliveries and Smarter Order Assignments for an On‐Demand Meal Delivery Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rapid growth of on‐demand meal delivery platforms has heightened competition, making customer retention a critical priority. While prior research on order dispatch algorithms has largely focused on minimizing delivery time or delay, the direct impact of delivery performance on repeat purchases remains underexplored. Using transactional data from an online meal delivery platform in China, we empirically investigate the asymmetric effects of early and late deliveries on customer repurchasing behavior. To address potential endogeneity, we introduce driver experience and local knowledge, two previously overlooked factors in platform algorithms, as novel instrumental variables. The survival analysis shows that late deliveries significantly reduce future orders, while early deliveries provide only limited benefits. Guided by these empirical insights, we develop a simulation‐based evaluation of different order dispatch algorithms, revealing that maximizing future orders, rather than minimizing delivery time or delays, yields the highest future orders. These insights offer actionable recommendations for platform managers, stressing the importance of strategic adjustments in dispatch algorithms and integrating heterogeneous treatment effects into algorithmic design. By merging operational delivery performance with consumer behavior insights through causal inference and optimization, this study provides a novel end‐to‐end framework for creating data‐driven dispatch algorithms that enhance both service efficiency and customer retention.</content>

    <title>Awe‐inspired: Appraising awe's consequences for consumers and brands</title>

      <name>Lisa A. Cavanaugh</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article builds on Keltner's conceptual model of awe, innovation, and choice (Keltner, 2025). This article expands on the framework in two main ways by outlining (1) when awe could have positive versus negative consequences for consumer choice and (2) how focusing on distinctive aspects of the consumer behavior setting may further enhance understanding of awe. Building on these themes, this article proposes several areas for research: examining granular aspects of the core appraisals, further characterizing different cognitive functions, considering consequences for different consumer choice domains (e.g., decision making, indulgence, customization), and focusing on how different kinds of relationships (e.g., brand communities), types of prosocial action (e.g., donating vs. volunteering), and forms of brand generated awe (direct vs. indirect) impact consumer behavior. This article offers specific propositions to encourage future research on how awe may impact consumers and brands.</content>

    <title>Growing Platforms by Adding Complementors Without a Contract</title>
    <updated>2025-02-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practitioner-Oriented AbstractOnline platforms often face challenges in sustaining growth, especially in competitive markets such as food delivery. This paper examines a novel strategy in which platforms list nonpartnered restaurants, allowing consumers to order from them via third-party deliverers. Whereas these restaurants gain visibility without paying commissions, concerns arise about potential harm because of lack of control over menus and pricing.We analyze the impact of this strategy using data from Grubhub and a California policy change that banned nonpartnered listings. We find that being listed as nonpartnered boosts takeout revenue for these restaurants, particularly independent ones. Additionally, there’s a positive spillover effect on partnered restaurants. However, regulatory delisting reverses these gains, highlighting the delicate balance between platform growth strategies and regulatory actions.For platform owners, this study underscores the potential of noncontracted partnerships as a growth strategy, especially if there are third-party enablers on the platform such as deliverers. However, it also cautions against potential disruptions from regulatory changes, urging businesses to adapt their strategies accordingly.For restaurant owners, our finding emphasizes the importance of adapting to changes by enhancing operational readiness to capitalize on increased visibility. They should advocate for regulations that enhance their choices and overall transparency, not inadvertently decrease them.Policy-Oriented AbstractIn the competitive landscape of online platforms, the pursuit of growth often necessitates innovative strategies. Whereas such strategies are deemed controversial and get pushbacks from some participants, how should policymakers respond?This research provides insights into such a scenario by investigating a novel growth strategy in which food delivery platforms onboarded nonpartnered restaurants, enabling consumer interactions without formal contracts, promising an increased visibility without commission fees. Leveraging data from Grubhub and a policy change in California, we find that being listed boosts takeout revenue significantly, especially for independent restaurants, with positive spillovers on partnered restaurants. However, delisting reverses these gains.For policymakers, these findings challenge the narrative that nonpartnered listings are inherently harmful. They highlight the potential of such arrangements to increase market access and revenue, particularly for independent businesses. However, the study also underscores the need for balanced regulation. Whereas protecting restaurants is crucial, overly restrictive policies can limit their choices and growth opportunities.We recommend a policy approach that empowers restaurants by requiring platforms to obtain explicit consent before listing them. Additionally, enhancing transparency around nonpartnered listings and associated fees can enable customers to make informed choices. This approach fosters a fair market, preserving the benefits of platform-enabled growth for all stakeholders.</content>

    <title>Normalization: How Organizations Socialize Newcomers to Make the Extraordinary Seem Ordinary</title>
    <updated>2025-02-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Blake E. Ashforth</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How does an organization take a raw recruit and have them dispose of bombs, slaughter animals, or work in polar research stations? I argue that the answer is through socializing them so that they come to view the extraordinary as more ordinary. This “normalization” typically entails: (1) setting the context by creating a strong situation in the form of a social cocoon with high normative control; (2) setting the content by providing a clear frame and ideology, conveyed through various forms of discourse; and (3) setting the process of socialization in motion by recruiting and selecting promising individuals and subjecting them to synergistic combinations of divestiture and investiture and of incrementalism and immersion, routinizing the work, and facilitating stress coping. These practices are mutually reinforcing such that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. The outcome is newcomers who can take in stride and accomplish what may have once seemed unthinkable. However, the socialization process is largely the same whether the goals are socially desirable (e.g., pursuing a grand challenge) or socially undesirable (e.g., extremism), and whether the means are socially desirable (most work) or undesirable (e.g., “dirty work”). I conclude with a discussion of the ethical implications of normalizing, a summary of common managerial practices for normalizing, and directions for future research.</content>

    <title>Something in the air: does air pollution affect fund managers’ carbon divestment?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether mutual fund managers overestimate carbon risk when they are exposed to local air pollution. We find that air pollution near fund managers induces them to underweight stocks of high-emission firms. The effects strengthen among environmentally conscious fund managers and among those likely to be surprised by air pollution—consistent with the idea that managers revise their beliefs about carbon risk following exposure to air pollution. A firm’s carbon-emissions disclosures and fund managers’ sophistication moderate these effects. Carbon-intensive stocks sold by fund managers who are exposed to local air pollution subsequently outperform stocks they buy, suggesting that such underweighting is costly to fund investors.</content>

    <title>Micro MPCs and Macro Counterfactuals: The Case of the 2008 Rebates</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present evidence that the high estimated MPCs from the leading household studies result in implausible macroeconomic counterfactuals. Using the 2008 tax rebate as a case study, we calibrate a standard macro model with the estimated micro MPCs to construct counterfactual macroeconomic consumption paths in the absence of a rebate. The counterfactual paths imply that consumption expenditures would have plummeted in spring and summer 2008 and then mostly recovered in September 2008. We use narratives and forecasts to argue that these paths are implausible. We then show that standard two-way fixed effect estimates of the micro MPCs are upward biased. When we correct for the biases, we estimate smaller micro MPCs using the CEX data than the previous literature. We also show that realistic modifications of the model result in general equilibrium forces that dampen rather than amplify micro MPCs. The combination of smaller micro MPCs and dampening general equilibrium forces implies general equilibrium consumption multipliers that are below 0.2.</content>

    <title>A Monetary-Fiscal Theory of Sudden Inflations</title>
    <updated>2025-02-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper posits an information channel as an explanation for sudden inflations. Households saving via nominal government bonds face a choice whether to acquire costly information about future government surpluses. They trade off the cost of acquiring information about the surpluses that back bond repayment against the benefit of a more informed saving decision. Through the information channel, small changes in the economic environment can trigger large responses in consumers’ behavior and prices. This setting explains why there can be long stretches of time during which government surpluses have large movements with little inflation response; yet, at some point, something snaps, and a sudden inflation takes off that is strongly responsive to incoming fiscal news.</content>

    <title>Bond Market Transparency and Innovation Along the Supply Chain</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Utilizing the introduction of the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) as an exogenous shock to enhance secondary bond market transparency, we investigate the informational feedback effect of the bond market on supplier innovation in vertical relationships. We find that the increased availability of trading details regarding major customers’ outstanding bonds significantly fosters their supplier firms’ innovative investment. This positive effect of bond market transparency enhancements on supplier innovation is weakened when major customers demonstrate a better information environment, have higher levels of institutional ownership, and share common institutional investors with suppliers, while strengthened when the bond market conveys positive information about major customers, and when major customers face tighter financial constraints, exhibit higher levels of risk-taking, and possess greater importance to suppliers. Our findings clearly identify the informational role of the bond market in corporate investment decisions and specifically highlight the importance of bond market information regarding customer firms to the innovation along the supply chain.</content>

    <title>Bridging Adversarial and Nonstationary Multi-Armed Bandit</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the multi-armed bandit framework, there are two formulations that are commonly employed to handle time-varying reward distributions: adversarial bandit and nonstationary bandit. Although their oracles, algorithms, and regret analysis differ significantly, we provide a unified formulation in this article that smoothly bridges the two as special cases. The formulation uses an oracle that takes the best action sequences within a switch budget. Depending on the switch budget, it turns into the oracle in hindsight in the adversarial bandit and the dynamic oracle in the nonstationary bandit. We provide algorithms that attain the optimal regret with the matching lower bound. The optimal regret displays distinct behavior in two regimes.</content>

    <title>Delegation Versus Control Mechanism: Impacts on Second-Hand Markets With Product Upgrades</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The second-hand market (SM) trades used products from the reverse channel. In practice, manufacturers such as Apple Inc. collect used products and sell refurbished products in the SM. However, third-party firms (TPFs) such as Gazelle independently manage the SM. Alternatively, the manufacturer may delegate the responsibility of managing the SM to a TPF under a contract or choose to operate in the SM with a TPF serving as a competitor. The optimal strategy to manage the SM is an important operations issue for the manufacturer as well as the TPF. This decision becomes even more critical when the manufacturer plans to sell the upgraded version, markdown version, and remanufactured version of the product concurrently. In the presence of product competition, SM selling can affect the prices and sales of the markdown product as well as the upgraded product. Therefore, in this study, we analyze impacts of the manufacturer’s choice of delegation. Our analytical findings reveal that the SM selling strongly influences the equilibrium price and the demand for the markdown product offered by the manufacturer under all the mechanisms. However, demand cannibalization of the markdown product is most severe under the delegation mechanism. Additionally, we counter-intuitively reveal that the manufacturer is better-off under the delegation mechanism when the sales commission is low and remanufacturing cost is high. In fact, the delegation mechanism is found to be the most profitable arrangement for the manufacturer as well as the TPF. Interestingly, demand for the upgraded version product remains unaffected by SM sales under the independent TPF mechanism, allowing the manufacturer to launch the upgraded version product without any fear of demand cannibalization. Furthermore, we discover that consumers secure the maximum surplus under the competitive scenario owing to intense price competitiveness. For robustness checking, we further extend our model to consider the cases with variable remanufacturing cost, differential emission cost, environmental cost, and collection rate of used product.</content>

    <title>Looking at the Trees to See the Forest: Construal Level Shift in Strategic Problem Framing and Formulation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Effective strategy development, evaluation, and implementation starts with a comprehensive understanding of strategic problems. However, developing such an understanding is often challenging due to the complexity of such problems and because how they can be solved is not yet known. Managers often oversimplify these problems by focusing on a few symptoms and obvious causes. Research indicates that big picture, abstract thinking helps managers explore underlying causes more flexibly, but it can also lead to overlooking key symptoms that do not fit existing frameworks. Instead, concrete thinking is likely essential for individuals to identify the full range of symptoms characterizing strategic problems. Because symptoms are essential for fully understanding strategic problems—they are the building blocks for managers to build theories about causes—both concrete and abstract thinking may be necessary. Drawing on construal level theory, we propose a construal level shift model. The central claim of our model is that managers benefit from first adopting a low construal level (concrete) thinking when framing strategic problems to identify all relevant symptoms. The benefit of a high construal level (abstract) thinking lies in combining these symptoms more flexibly to theorize more comprehensively about the underlying causes. Two experimental studies and one correlational study, involving samples of working individuals, managers, and experienced executives, support our model. Our findings contribute to the behavioral and knowledge-based views of the firm, the theory-based view of strategy, and managerial cognition research.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.19134 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;New Insights into Off-line Estimation for Controlled Markov Chains UnveiledA team of researchers from Purdue and Northwestern Universities have unveiled new findings in off-line estimation for controlled Markov chains, addressing challenges in analyzing complex data generated under arbitrary dynamics. The study introduces a nonparametric estimator for transition probabilities, showcasing its robustness even in nonstationary, non-Markovian environments.The team developed precise sample complexity bounds, revealing a delicate interplay between mixing properties of the logging policy and data set size. Their analysis highlights how achieving optimal statistical risk depends on this trade-off, broadening the scope of off-line estimation under diverse conditions. Examples include ergodic and weakly ergodic chains as well as controlled chains with episodic or greedy controls.Significantly, this research confirms that the widely used estimator, which calculates state–action transition ratios, is minimax optimal, ensuring its reliability in general scenarios. This advancement paves the way for improved evaluation of stationary Markov control policies, marking a breakthrough in understanding complex off-line systems.</content>

    <title>On Greedy-Like Policies in Online Matching with Reusable Network Resources and Decaying Rewards</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We build a unified modeling framework for classical online matching problems and emerging online matching problems with three additional practical features: reusable resources, network resources, and decaying rewards. For online matching problems in the unified framework, we provide a unified performance analysis tool for the greedy policy and its simple variants, which we refer to as greedy-like policies. We prove that greedy-like policies can achieve near-optimal performances for online matching problems in the unified framework, where the policy performance is measured by competitive ratios under adversarial environments. We then analyze several representative special classes of online matching problems, which incorporate additional realistic structural assumptions on top of the unified framework. Specifically, we consider online matching problems with each of the following three additional structures: (i) singleton resources with time-decaying rewards; (ii) network resources with accept/reject decisions; and (iii) network resources with interval-type bundles. We show that for these special classes of online matching problems, slight modifications to greedy-like policies can successfully utilize additional structural information to further enhance policy performances. This work may suggest that the greedy policy and its variants, despite its simplicity, can achieve reliable performances for a number of emerging online matching problems.This paper was accepted by J. George Shanthikumar, data science.Funding: The work of D. Simchi-Levi and F.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Martin K. Starr, aged 97, passed away January 25, 2025. During his 15-year tenure as editor-in-chief of Management Science, he became the longest serving editor of any INFORMS journal.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper offers a novel framework to quantify the expected gains from renegotiating delinquent loans. The framework accounts for important trade-offs between concessions to borrowers, postdelinquency loan performance, and expected collateral values. The framework’s parameters are calibrated using data on renegotiated 30-year residential fixed-rate mortgages that went delinquent during the Great Recession. Our model-implied expected gains increase during the 2007–2009 period coinciding with an increase in the rate of loan renegotiation. Counterfactual analyses show that larger expected gains can be generated from employing principal forbearance and extensions of the term to maturity compared with principal write-downs and interest-rate reductions. On the other hand, principal write-downs can be a powerful tool when borrowers are deeply underwater. Our analyses illustrate how lenders or policymakers might deploy this framework when faced with another delinquency crisis.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Funding: The author thanks the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and the Center for Investors and Financial Markets at the University of Virginia for funding for this paper.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02672 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study develops a theory of social proof in angel investing. We propose that availability bias leads angel group members to copy the highly visible decisions of new investors evaluating the same opportunity ( external social proof) and overlook the more insightful reinvestment decisions of prior investors ( internal social proof). We also theorize that more experienced investors generally herd less but selectively imitate knowledgeable investors from prior rounds. A study of investments by 469 angel group members and a vignette experiment with 367 participants support our hypotheses. Our findings contribute to research on social proof, decision-making under uncertainty, and investment experience.</content>

    <title>The Mission (Im)possible of Climate Action through Quixotic Institutional Work</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The ‘iron cage’ of the (neo‐) liberal‐capitalist system prioritizes economic returns over climate protection. Formerly powerful nation‐states are subordinated to the rule of markets, whereas business elites have been freed from substantial responsibility for social and environmental concerns. While we agree in principle with the Point that a reassertion of state power may facilitate more decided climate action, our Counterpoint adopts a cultural institutionalist perspective that highlights the embeddedness of actors in a broader cultural order. From this perspective, actors enact scripts while often lacking substantive agency towards protecting the natural environment. Cultural change in meanings, myths, practices, and rituals is needed to remodel the currently dominant scripts and templates of modern, liberal‐capitalist ‘world society’, including the script of state actorhood. We suggest the notion of ‘quixotic institutional work’ as a way of envisioning and prefiguring alternative cultural templates when both the physical and the social reality start showing cracks due to the climate crisis. Quixotic institutional work follows the logic of appropriateness rather than consequential purposiveness, and thus constitutes a different, often overlooked and mocked, form of agency for systems change relevant in the light of powerful forces towards maintaining an unsustainable world order.</content>

    <title>Beyond Money: Incentive Effects of Tokenized Ownership on User Contribution in &lt;scp&gt;DAOs&lt;/scp&gt;</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Blockchain technologies have catalyzed the rise of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which operate in an incentive network fueled by crypto tokens. In essence, these tokens are imbued with either payment rights (i.e., transactional tokens) or ownership rights (i.e., governance tokens). The decentralized organizational paradigm dismantles the traditional management structure and bring new research opportunities to Operations Management (OM). While the performance of DAOs has been largely examined in current OM literature, the effectiveness of their internal incentive mechanisms—specifically the one that uses ownership as rewards to promote user contributions—remains unclear. Focusing on DAO‐enabled virtual communities, we seek to examine whether decentralized ownership provides stronger incentives for user behaviors, such as creation and curation, in comparison to traditional monetary rewards through the lens of psychological ownership theory. We obtained data fromSteemitthat captures the reward, creation, curation and transaction behaviors of 98,000 users from May 2017 to April 2019. By leveraging the “power‐up” action as a shock that increases user ownership shares, we established a quasi‐experimental setting. Employing the PSM‐DID model, we found that the use of governance tokens is associated with enhanced creation and curation efforts but declined creation novelty, compared to the use of transactional tokens. Our additional analyses further reveal that the incentive effects of governance tokens diminish over time. However, upon the recurrence of the intended choice, these effects become reinforced. Notably, we find that governance token ownership is more strongly associated with curation efforts for users with weaker social ties. Conversely, for users with high reputation scores, their content creation behaviors are less strongly associated with governance token ownership. This study contributes to the burgeoning discourse on blockchain and cryptocurrency from an operational perspective, providing valuable insights for the design of incentive mechanisms in DAOs and advancing our understanding of operational efficiencies and stakeholder engagement in decentralized structures within Operations Management.</content>

    <title>Shock Anticipation: Voluntary Turnover by Foreign Directors in Response to Sanctions on Peer Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a new turnover mechanism, namelyshock anticipation, which explains how the anticipation of potential shocks triggers voluntary turnover by individuals in organizations. Drawing on the context of US sanctions on China initiated in 2018, we analyse a sample of foreign directors (FDs) from Chinese‐listed firms between 2014 and 2021. We suggest sanctions on peer firms lead FDs to anticipate potential sanctions on their own organizations and become concerned about the associated negative effects on their careers, which in turn motivates their turnover. We further argue that FDs at state‐owned enterprises (SOEs) anticipate a higher risk and, consequently, are more likely to leave after observing sanctions imposed on their peer firms. In contrast, FDs with shorter career horizons are less inclined to leave as they perceive diminished damage to their future career. Our empirical results provide robust support for these hypotheses. This study enriches the literature on turnover and sanctions while also offering practical implications.</content>

    <title>Turning Task-Adjusted Temporary Newcomers into Permanent Employees: An Identity Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While most of the socialization literature has focused on factors that allow newcomers to adjust to their new job tasks successfully, less attention has been given to examining whether temporary newcomers’ task adjustment influences the likelihood of receiving a permanent position. Drawing on the identity perspective and the socialization literature, this study proposes and tests a new framework that examines the probability of task-adjusted newcomers receiving a permanent job offer contingent on two conditions: a) there is a low level of peer divestiture socialization, which enables the task-adjusted newcomer to achieve higher levels of task performance, and b) the newcomer displays low rule-following behavior, which allows the high-performing newcomer to be cognitively trusted by the supervisor. Consistent with our predictions, the results of a four-wave, multisource study featuring 194 newcomer-supervisor dyads revealed that newcomer task adjustment was positively related to the newcomer receiving a permanent job offer by way of newcomer task performance and supervisor trust in newcomers but only when peer divestiture socialization and newcomer rule-following behavior were low. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of these findings.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Enhancing Attraction Experiences through Home Sharing: Evidence from Customer Review Analytics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Customer experiences largely define the success of service operations. As home sharing continues to change how consumers travel and penetrate local markets, we study the impact of home sharing on customer experiences at local travel attractions. Our empirical strategy hinges on the staggered rollout of home sharing across attractions at times. We first find that home sharing positively affects customer experiences at attractions. Using large-scale property-level customer reviews, we then trace down individual review-level content features describing host support that can explain the impact of home sharing on attraction experiences. Specifically, the mechanism centers on local travel support from hosts who provide saving tips, share attraction knowledge, and facilitate travel planning while consumers stay at their home sharing properties. We further explore the intriguing heterogeneity of home sharing impact, unveiling the unintended consequence of overtourism, especially at nationally renowned attractions and during peak season. Finally and fortunately, host support manifests to mitigate the negative impact of home sharing and remains a potential solution to address overtourism. Collectively, these findings add evidence to the sophisticated roles of home sharing in local markets and provide timely implications on customer experience management to service operation practitioners and attraction stakeholders.</content>

    <title>Designing E-commerce Livestreams: How Product Presentation Duration Affects Sales?</title>
    <updated>2025-02-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Livestream e-commerce has emerged as a novel way to promote and sell products. This channel differs from existing promotion channels like TV/online video advertising because viewers voluntarily consume the content on this channel and are highly engaged due to social interactivity with the livestreamer and other viewers. A key design aspect of product promotions is the duration for which a product is presented during a livestream session. In this article, we empirically study the impact of product presentation duration by analyzing a unique dataset from two of the largest livestream shopping platforms in China. We find that when the product duration is longer, product revenue is higher. However, as the average presentation time increases, the session revenue decreases. The role of presentation duration in driving sales may differ between official (single-brand) livestreams sponsored by brands and third-party (multi-brand) livestreams. On analyzing the heterogeneous effects between official and third-party livestreams, we find that the positive impact on product-level sales is largely driven by third-party livestreams. On the other hand, both official and third-party livestreams can improve session-level sales by reducing the average product duration in a session. Thus, in the context of third-party livestreams, we observe a tension between the incentives of the brands (advertisers) whose goal is to drive an individual product’s sales and third-party livestreamers whose goal is to maximize total sales in a session. Our findings have useful implications for the design of e-commerce livestreams.</content>

    <title>On the Design of a Shared Waiting Room</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the design of a waiting area of a service system where different types of customers seek different services, provided by designated servers. We examine two waiting room designs: The designated waiting room, where each server has its own designated waiting area, and the shared waiting room, where all customers are waiting together. In the designated waiting room design, customers observe the number of customers waiting for each service, whereas in the shared waiting room, customers cannot distinguish which service the other customers are waiting for, but can still observe the total number of customers in the waiting room and make a joining/balking decision accordingly. Assuming two types of customers that have similar characteristics seeking service from two different servers, we show that all customers adopt an identical pure equilibrium threshold. We find the shared waiting room design achieves higher throughput than the designated waiting room design when the congestion rate is low. However, the designated waiting room is always preferable in terms of social welfare. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the asymmetric case, where types differ from each other in terms of arrival rate, service reward, per unit-time waiting cost, and service duration. Finding the equilibrium strategies in these cases is more challenging and requires an iterative process. We show that mixed equilibrium thresholds can emerge, and that the designated waiting room does not always improve system performance, even when considering social welfare.</content>

    <title>Investor Learning in Crowdfunded Supply Chain Finance Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crowdfunded Supply Chain Finance (SCF) represents a novel market design that transforms financial flows within the SCF paradigm. It enables crowd investors to serve as financers, lending vital working capital to suppliers facing liquidity problems. A distinctive feature of this market is the mandatory involvement of loan guarantors, which facilitates repeated interactions between investors and fundraisers, potentially fostering investor learning. To understand how such learning dynamics shape investor decision-making, we develop a Bayesian learning model that conceptualizes investor perceptions of guarantor reliability as a subjective attitude underlying the perceived risk of a loan listing. The model posits that investors can learn about a guarantor's reliability through a series of scheduled repayments involving the same guarantor over time. We consider investor decision-making a joint process comprising two interdependent components: (a) the incidence decision of whether to invest and (b) the amount decision of how much to invest. Our results reveal that investor perceptions of guarantor reliability play a crucial role in shaping both decisions, albeit in distinct ways. While perceived reliability exerts a positive, monotonic effect on amount decisions, its impact on incidence decisions follows an inverted U-shaped pattern. Furthermore, perceived reliability attenuates the positive effect of loan interest rates on both decisions, suggesting that the appeal of higher returns diminishes as investors’ reliability perceptions increase. A posterior analysis further shows that offering high interest rates may become counterproductive when perceived reliability is sufficiently high. These findings provide actionable implications for platform designers and participants in crowdfunded SCF markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How we manage operations—the domain of Operations Management (OM)—has important implications for the practice of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in organizations. Conversely, DEI goals have important implications for organizations’ OM practices. We outline the two-way links between DEI and OM to offer future research opportunities. In particular, we examine interactions between OM and DEI across four broad themes: (1) Workforce, (2) Supply Chains, (3) Health and Society, and (4) Technology, Platforms, and Innovation. We conclude with a discussion of DEI in OM as it relates to research and teaching. This article is a collaborative effort with the Senior Editors involved in the special issue of Production and Operations Management on “DEI in Operations and Supply Chain Management.”</content>

    <title>The Resilience of Fashion Retail Stores</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Retail stores are an essential sales channel in the economy. What makes them resilient to external shocks? We propose a conceptual framework in which resilience is determined by (a) the intrinsic stability of the customer pool that the store serves and (b) the actions the store implements to cope with external shocks. We apply our framework to study the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on thousands of fashion stores across the world, using a novel high-frequency scraping method to infer daily sales. Our results indicate a severe impact of lockdown regulations, with remarkable store-level heterogeneity. Stores of smaller size, in high-income lower-density areas, catering to non-touristic demand, and not located in shopping malls were intrinsically more resistant to external shocks. Furthermore, stores that chose to be more differentiated (reduced assortment similarity) and to keep a fresher inventory (faster inventory days) were also able to attenuate the impact of the pandemic. Our framework can be useful for policymakers, who are interested in identifying and targeting most vulnerable businesses, as well as managers, who would like to build a network of stores sufficiently resistant to shocks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The proliferation of fake news, more recently multimodal fake news, poses a significant threat to individuals, organizations, and society. While online social media platforms have employed automated methods to combat fake news, they face two notable challenges: the scarcity of labeled data and the diversity of news domains. To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of online platforms in mitigating the spread of fake news, this study proposes MT-GPD (multimodal deep transfer learning with gating network, model patch, and domain classifier) for cross-domain fake news detection. MT-GPD integrates three novel design artifacts as auxiliary mechanisms for enhancing multimodal deep transfer learning, including a gating network that captures the relative importance of textual and visual components of individual news articles for dynamic fusion; a customized model patch that balances detection performance and computational efficiency; and a domain classifier that adapts multimodal representations to a target news domain. We evaluate the performance of MT-GPD using news datasets spanning four different domains. The results demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of MT-GPD, providing strong evidence for the impacts of the proposed auxiliary mechanisms on improving fake news detection performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Modeling Cooperative and Noncooperative Incentives in Investment Projects: A Novel Approach Using Cooperative Game Theory and Real Options TheoryIn “Dynamic Stability of Cooperative Investment under Uncertainty,” Ketelaars, Borm, and Kort study an investment project involving multiple stakeholders. The research was prompted by the fact that many infrastructure projects, such as Feyenoord City in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and the new Berlin airport, failed or were significantly delayed. Recognizing that the various stakeholders have outside options, the authors combine concepts from cooperative game theory and real options to analyze a coalitional and dynamic stability concept. They characterize the proportional investment scheme as the scheme that maximizes total project value and results in the earliest investment timing. They show that dynamic stability can be present when the market is stable and when the market is growing and volatile. However, the proportional investment scheme is more sensitive to dynamic instability in a market with high profit growth and low profit uncertainty, or vice versa.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage the unique institutional feature that the Israeli government bond market operates on an exchange rather than over-the-counter to analyze whether and why having an exchange affects market liquidity during a crisis. We document how the liquidity crisis in March 2020 affected the Israeli government bond market and conduct difference-in-differences analyses, comparing bid-ask spreads in exchange markets, such as the Israeli government bond market, with markets lacking an exchange. Our findings support the idea that having an exchange enhances market liquidity. A counterfactual analysis using trade data from the Israeli exchange suggests that this is due to the ability of investors to readily provide liquidity to one another and the efficient netting of trade flows on an exchange.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02344 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates group-level customer–company identification (CCI), extending social identity theory to explore how individual-level identification evolves into strong, collective group dynamics. By analyzing interconnected customer groups, the research demonstrates how these dynamics shape individual behavior and drive organizational outcomes across diverse group types. Drawing on a comprehensive, three-year data set from a national retailer, the study assesses collective CCI within these groups. The findings reveal that group-level CCI significantly influences individual CCI, which in turn affects consumer spending and share of wallet. Furthermore, the research identifies the optimal conditions for maximizing group influence, highlighting that moderately sized (10-20 members), homogenous groups that meet three to ten times per year have the greatest impact. These insights enhance the understanding of CCI by focusing on group-level effects and extending social identity theory to address the conditions under which group-level identification exerts the strongest influence. The study offers practical strategies for managers to build group cohesion, foster loyalty, and improve customer interactions by leveraging group dynamics across organizational, social, and consumer contexts.</content>

    <title>Racial Inequity in Donation-Based Crowdfunding Platforms: The Role  of Facial Emotional Expressiveness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Donation-based crowdfunding platforms often claim to pursue equitable outcomes for all beneficiaries, yet many face criticism for failing to do so across different demographic profiles. In response, platform managers are eager to understand how these inequities emerge and explore solutions to address them. In this research, the authors show that the degree of facial emotional expressiveness of beneficiaries in uploaded images can differentially impact donation amounts for White versus Black beneficiaries. Drawing on social vision theory, the authors propose that facial emotional expressiveness in images, combined with the beneficiary’s race, activates racial stereotypes of emotion expression that result in differential donation amounts to Black and White individuals. Analyzing a sample of 4,153 campaigns from GoFundMe between June 2021 and September 2022, along with a follow-up experiment, the authors find that higher facial emotional expressiveness is associated with significantly lower donation amounts for Black compared with White beneficiaries. Further exploring our moderating constructs reveals that the use of call-to-action cues, affective messaging, and race-gender homophily cues can attenuate the activation of stereotypes and therefore reduce differences in donation amounts between racial groups. Based on these findings, the authors offer targeted recommendations for platform managers to reduce racial inequities in crowdfunding outcomes.</content>

    <title>Goal Hierarchies: Understanding Sub‐Goal and Primary Goal Interdependency</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is increased research on how organizations respond to performance feedback on multiple goals. Most of it considers goals that have ambiguous ranking and thus differs from goal hierarchies with sub‐goals that are instrumental for accomplishing a primary goal. We develop theory on how goal hierarchies lead to primary goal and sub‐goal interactions influencing organizational decision‐making. We show that sub‐goals are important because they are temporally prior and instrumental for primary goals, making organizational responses to sub‐goals and primary goal interdependent in interesting ways. Empirically, we demonstrate a more sophisticated approach to multiple goals than earlier work suggests. This advances the behavioural theory of the firm, and supports and refines key assumptions for organizational design and organizational economics, encouraging further research on the role of goal structures and incentive schemes. Our theory and findings call for increased consideration of the March and Simon's (1958) hierarchical goals’ model in management research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how lenders design contracts to account for transitory and permanent cash flow shocks facing borrowers. We find that volatile transitory cash flow shocks are associated with fewer liquidity covenants, indicating financial flexibility that enables firms to survive liquidity crunches. The opposite is true for volatile permanent cash flow, suggesting that borrowers’ economic fundamentals are important credit risk factors. Subsequent analyses show that borrowers exposed to transitory (permanent) shocks face less (more) severe credit consequences following poor performance. Overall, we show that transitory and permanent cash flow shocks have significant and opposite effects on debt contract covenant design.</content>

    <title>Ephemeral State-Dependent Recommendation for Digital Content</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-oriented AbstractBuilding upon recent advances in consumption theories, we propose an ephemeral state-dependent framework for digital content recommendations. The framework accentuates a critical, yet understudied, interplay between a firm’s recommendation strategy (assimilation or diversification) and a consumer’s ephemeral state (fixation or foraging). The framework adaptively recommends either assimilated or diversified content based on a consumer’s ephemeral state. Through a randomized field experiment, we provide compelling evidence that state-dependent schemes can enhance engagement and revenue. Although the congruent scheme (i.e., assimilation when fixation, diversification when foraging) generally outperforms the incongruent one, contributing a 7.3% ($19.73 million) annual revenue lift for the platform, our findings underscore the necessity for nuanced personalization. Specifically, consumers with broader, more fluid preferences benefit more from the incongruent scheme (i.e., assimilation when foraging, diversification when fixation), challenging the prevailing assumption that congruence is always optimal. Our research not only adds to the theoretical understanding of consumer behavior in digital content consumption, but also offers actionable insights for designing more effective recommender systems. By accounting for consumer heterogeneity and considering the broader implications of our proposed recommendation framework, including spillover effects, our findings have the potential to influence industry practices and future academic inquiry in this rapidly evolving field.</content>

    <title>When Breaking the Law Gets You the Job: Evidence from the Electronic Dance Music Community</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why would a law-abiding occupational community support members engaged in legally prohibited actions? We propose that lawbreaking can elicit informal support when it is construed as a disinterested action—intended to serve the community rather than the perpetrator. We study how illegal remixing (“bootlegging”) affects an artist’s ability to secure opening act and other performance opportunities in the electronic dance music (EDM) community, whose members endorse the substance of copyright law but whose norms about bootlegging are ambiguous. Data on 38,784 disc jockeys (DJs) across 97 countries over 10 years reveal that producing bootlegs is associated with more opportunities to perform, compared to producing official remixes or original music. This effect disappears when community members view bootlegging as a self-serving action—primarily designed to benefit the perpetrator. An online experiment and an expert survey rule out the possibility that bootlegs are considered more creative, of higher quality, or better able to attract attention. We shed additional light on our proposed mechanism by analyzing data from 34 interviews with EDM professionals. This helps us to explain how a lawbreaker can paradoxically be perceived as serving the community, thereby eliciting active community support for their action.</content>

    <title>A Little Help from My Friends? Navigating the Tension Between Social Capital and Meritocracy in the Job Search</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Job seekers often rely on help from social ties in the search for employment. Yet the job search is characterized by meritocratic ideals according to which candidates should be selected based on their qualifications, not their connections. How do people justify the use of connections given the conflicting cultural logics of social capital and meritocracy? We conduct an inductive analysis of 56 interviews with young Spaniards experiencing a difficult labor market and identify a novel process of justification, situational alignment, that reconciles these conflicting logics. Respondents justified situations in which connections provided assistance as legitimate when they perceived alignment among the job seeker, job, and type of help that connections provided. Respondents deemed illegitimate the situations in which these were not aligned. These justifications allowed respondents to embrace the social capital logic’s prescription to use connections, while upholding the meritocratic principle that jobs be awarded based on qualifications. We further find that situations involving close ties were more readily justified than those involving distant others. We test this inductively derived process using a survey experiment with 1,536 young Spaniards. This study demonstrates that perceptions of merit are situated, and advances the understanding of social capital by identifying a novel process of justification that contributes to labor market inequality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Chief executive officer (CEO) political activism is increasing, but its strategic implications remain unclear. We conduct two survey‐based experiments to shed light on how individuals respond to CEO activism. We differentiate between communicating an apolitical stance versus saying nothing ‐ an unexplored distinction to date. We furthermore examine whether characteristics which could influence perceived credibility of the stance ‐ whether it is consistent with expectations and whether it is backed by monetary commitment ‐ influence responses. We thus contribute to a deeper understanding of whether and how individuals’ perceptions of the firm are affected by CEO activism.Managerial SummaryIt is critical for managers to understand the implications of engaging in CEO political activism, a practice which has been on the rise in recent decades. Actively communicating an apolitical stance versus passively staying silent about an issue are two separate strategic choices available to managers which have been unexplored in the literature to date. This paper sheds light on how individuals respond to firms' communicating an apolitical stance, saying nothing, or taking an ideological stance in either direction on a political issue; and how this varies depending on whether the stance is perceived as consistent with expectations and whether it is backed by monetary commitment. It thus helps managers navigate stance‐taking on political issues.</content>

    <title>Channel Structures for a Dual-Purpose Firm: Direct, Retail, or Hybrid?</title>
    <updated>2025-02-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The advance in e-commerce has provided firms with more options when designing their channel structures. The rise of “beyond profit” managerial doctrine has also added complexity to channel design. Extending the literature in distribution channels that focuses on for-profit firms, this paper develops a stylized model to examine the channel design problem for a socially responsible manufacturer who pursues a dual-purpose objective—the manufacturer values both profit and consumer surplus. We compare three channel structures: Direct selling (centralization), retailing only (decentralization), and the hybrid of both the direct and indirect channels. We show that double marginalization rooted in the retail channel can alleviate the manufacturer’s loss in profit due to her pursuit of consumer surplus. Thus, compared to direct selling, retailing only may lead to a higher profit for the manufacturer (even when the manufacturer’s direct channel is as efficient as the retail channel) and a higher conversion efficiency in boosting consumer surplus at the expense of the manufacturer’s profit. In the hybrid channel analysis, we show that the manufacturer’s pursuit of consumer surplus leads to upward distortion of direct sales. Facing competition from direct sales, the retailer becomes less sensitive to the wholesale price, and the manufacturer has to reduce the wholesale price significantly to boost the retailer’s order quantity, leading to serious downward wholesale price distortion when the consumer focus is high. Counterintuitively, we find that as the selling cost disadvantage in direct selling increases, the manufacturer with a higher consumer focus increases the wholesale price to rely more on direct selling. We also find that the hybrid structure may cause loss in profit due to price and quantity distortions, leading to lower manufacturer utility and conversion efficiency compared to the single-channel structures. We also provide several extensions to show the robustness of our main findings and offer further insights for channel design for dual-purpose organizations.</content>

    <title>Degeneracy Is OK: Logarithmic Regret for Network Revenue Management with Indiscrete Distributions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The network revenue management problem is a fundamental problem in online decision making with resource constraints. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to deriving near-optimal policies for the network revenue management problem with a theoretical guarantee better than the classic $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret. Logarithmic or better regret has been derived, however, with an additional nondegeneracy assumption that requires the underlying fluid approximation to enjoy a unique optimal basis. This work relaxes the nondegeneracy assumption and achieves logarithmic regret for network revenue management problems for general indiscrete reward distribution. To achieve these advances, this work develops several new techniques, including a new method of bounding myopic regret, a semifluid relaxation of the off-line allocation, and an improved bound on the dual convergence, which has the potential to inspire other works. All in all, this work takes a fundamental step toward relaxing the nondegeneracy assumption, which traditionally limits the scope of online algorithms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Unveiling Hidden Shifts: Detecting Change Points in Dynamic Networks with Missing LinksDynamic networks are ubiquitous in a world increasingly driven by interconnected systems from social media platforms to financial transactions, transportation systems, and cybersecurity infrastructures. Unlike static entities, these networks evolve, often undergoing abrupt structural changes. Detecting these changes is essential as they can signal critical events, such as cyberattacks or shifts in user behavior.The challenge becomes even greater when dealing with incomplete data, a common reality in large-scale networks. Missing links, from nonresponses or privacy concerns, create uncertainty, complicating the identification of structural changes.The paper “Change-Point Detection in Dynamic Networks with Missing Links” tackles this issue with a robust framework based on the matrix CUSUM test statistic. This novel methodology is adaptable to expanding networks and resilient to missing data. It detects structural shifts with minimax optimality, ensuring theoretical robustness. Extensive simulations and real-world examples reveal that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods. It provides a valuable tool for monitoring dynamic networks, detecting fraud, and spotting emerging trends.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop an economic model of a decentralized exchange with concentrated liquidity (e.g., Uniswap v3 and v4), with a particular focus on the economics of liquidity provision. We demonstrate that providing liquidity for a risky/risk-free asset pool is comparable to investing in a covered call, except that the call option therein is sold at intrinsic rather than market value. Hence, when providing liquidity, liquidity providers forgo the time premium of the call option in exchange for fees, and thus equilibrium liquidity provision decreases in the time premium. Finally, we provide an expression for equilibrium liquidity provision that is useful for empirical work.This paper has been This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong for the Special Issue on Digital Finance.</content>

    <title>The Role of Inclusive Leadership: In Reducing Disability Accommodation Request Withholding</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Workplace disability accommodations are intended to help level the playing field and create more accessible, inclusive workplaces. Yet, research shows that people with disabilities often experience insufficient accommodations as a result of both employers’ and employees’ attitudes about accommodations. The current work seeks to shed new light on psychological processes underlying disability accommodation request withholding. To do so, we draw upon a relational framework and use social tuning theory to develop a model examining the relationship between inclusive leadership and accommodation request withholding, as mediated by employees’ perceived disability stigma and moderated by disability severity and relational-interdependent self-construal. We tested our model across two studies with Chinese employees—including a survey study with three waves of data from 290 employees with physical disabilities and an experimental-causal-chain designed vignette study with 526 participants. Our findings indicated that inclusive leadership was associated with employees’ lower perceived disability stigma, and that was related to reduced accommodation request withholding. Furthermore, this relationship was more pronounced in employees with higher disability severity and relational-interdependent self-construal. Our research provides novel insights for disability diversity management, particularly around the role of inclusive leadership in fostering enabling workplace environments.</content>

    <title>Institutional Ties and Publications in Top Accounting Journals</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Academic journals certify and disseminate scientific knowledge. However, institutional ties between journals and universities can lead to conflicts of interest that compromise peer review. I consider publication patterns in the “Top 3” accounting journals in light of the journals’ governance structures and institutional ties. The Accounting Review (TAR), governed by the American Accounting Association (AAA), has no university affiliations. Journal of Accounting and Economics (JAE) and Journal of Accounting Research (JAR) are private journals with longstanding editorial ties to specific universities: the University of Rochester, the University of Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology for JAE and the University of Chicago for JAR. For publications from 2000–2022, I find that journal-affiliated authors (current faculty and recent PhDs from journal-affiliated universities) publish disproportionately in their affiliate journal. Further analysis suggests that this pattern does not appear to be attributable primarily to authors’ journal submission preferences, particularly for JAR affiliates. In fact, JAR affiliates publish their least cited work in JAR (relative to TAR and JAE), and affiliate articles in JAR receive significantly fewer citations than articles in JAR by authors from top institutions unaffiliated with JAR. Results further suggest that institutional ties may be particularly impactful for pretenure PhD affiliates and for the publication of dissertations. The results are consistent with the idea that institutional ties may influence the publication process in accounting journals, particularly at JAR, where institutional affiliations are formalized and concentrated in one institution.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04553 .</content>

    <title>Blocking Block Formation: Evidence from Private Loan Contracts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does the structure of the borrower’s equity ownership matter in debt contracting? This paper addresses this question by examining change in control clauses. These clauses are pervasive in loan contracts, yet their terms are not boilerplate. Examining 14,940 contracts, we document significant heterogeneity in the use and size of ownership caps, which limit large equity block formation. Overall, our evidence indicates that the way equity capital is distributed matters to lenders. Lenders set lower caps to mitigate risks arising from power contests among shareholders, formation of a new (coordinating) block, potentially resulting in activism, and hostile takeover threats via toehold strategies. We confirm some of these effects using two quasi-natural experiments. Caps below 50% are associated with a drop in firm value but not in the cost of debt, consistent with exacerbated firm-manager agency costs. Finally, two findings shed light on ways creditors may influence corporate governance: the largest block size increases when these minority block restrictions expire, and the likelihood of withdrawing an announced buyback increases during the life of these loans.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04224 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce the first adaptively priced iterative combinatorial auction design, which gradually extends price expressiveness as the rounds progress. This mechanism achieves both high efficiency and fast convergence across a wide range of valuation domains. We implement our auction design using polynomial prices, show how to detect when the current price structure is insufficient to clear the market, and show how to correctly expand the polynomial structure to guarantee progress. An experimental evaluation confirms that our auction is competitive with bundle-price auctions in domains where these excel, namely multiminded valuations, but also performs well in domains favorable to linear prices, such as valuations with pairwise synergy.This paper was accepted by Axel Ockenfels, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.4993 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Insufficient recovery from work stress is a pernicious issue for many workers. This study aims to understand the important role that supervisors play in employees’ recovery experiences. Specifically, we (1) proposed an expanded conceptualization of supervisor support for recovery (SSR), and (2) developed and validated a measure consistent with this expanded conceptualization. We refined the conceptualization of SSR with four dimensions: refraining from communicating about work during nonwork time, refraining from requiring work during nonwork time, modeling recovery, and encouraging recovery. These dimensions align with the recovery literature, which highlights the necessity of refraining from recovery-hindering behaviors to reduce energy exertion and engaging in recovery-promoting behaviors to provide recovery opportunities. The recovery-promoting dimensions also align with key themes of role modeling and encouragement emphasized in social cognitive theory. Based on the conceptualization, we further developed and validated an SSR scale using three different designs (cross-sectional, supervisor-subordinate dyadic, time-separated) in six studies. Results showed that SSR was distinct from related supervisor constructs (e.g., leader-member exchange and family supportive supervisor behaviors), was positively associated with recovery experiences, and provided further insight into recovery experiences, over and above the other supervisor constructs. This study provides a foundation for future research to better understand how supervisors can support employee recovery from work stress.</content>

    <title>The spirit of the times: historical conditions and market-seeking FDI strategies by U.S. alcohol firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Market-seeking foreign direct investment (FDI) remains central for firms to expand their global presence and seize opportunities abroad. However, existing research often focuses on immediate or near-term drivers related to firms’ market-seeking FDI strategies, and thus neglects the valuable insights a historical perspective can provide. To address this gap, we draw insights from imprinting theory and propose a framework theorizing the dual-layered imprinting of historical conditions stemming from both extreme historical experiences and founding conditions. Using the U.S. alcohol industry as a research context, we employ a mixed-methods approach, integrating quantitative and qualitative techniques. Our findings reveal that firms’ experiences during extreme anti-alcohol conditions, such as Prohibition, positively correlate with regulation-driven market-seeking FDI, while firms founded in more pro-alcohol periods prioritize speed-driven market-seeking FDI. Moreover, we identify how unrelated diversification, a strategy consistent with the anti-alcohol imprint but inconsistent with the pro-alcohol imprint, affects the relationship between historical imprints and FDI strategies through imprint amplification or decay. Our qualitative analyses elucidate the role of founders’ and leaders’ strategic decision-making in reinforcing the mechanisms through which historical conditions shape FDI strategy. This longitudinal framework provides insights into imprint formation, transmission, and manifestation, accounting for contextual variations and implications for FDI strategy.</content>

    <title>Individual Experience and Home Price Expectations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether the heterogeneity of expectations is associated with idiosyncratic variations in experience. Combining household survey data and administrative data from the Netherlands, we find that given market development, households’ expectations about house price changes vary with their individual experience. This association is related to the use of information conveyed by experience, which varies in terms of informativeness, recency, and household sophistication. Finally, we find that individual experience also explains how far house price expectations deviate from realized house prices and that it may affect household behavior. Our findings elucidate the role that individual experience plays in expectation formation.</content>

    <title>“Complexity Is the Worst Enemy of Security”: Studying Cybersecurity Through the Lens Of Organizational Complexity</title>
    <updated>2025-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <name>Bruce Schneier, Anthony Vance</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Writing about computer systems twenty-five years ago, Schneier wrote that “the worst enemy of security is complexity” (Schneier, 1999), because complex systems are both easier to attack and harder to secure than simpler ones. In this essay, we provide an overview of Schneier’s complexity principle and provide our observations of how two articles in this issue, Liang et al. (2025) and Tanriverdi et al. (2025), employed this principle in their research. We also offer our ideas for why complexity and cybersecurity are especially amenable for study in the field of information systems and where future research can go from here.</content>

    <title>The Critical Challenge of using Large-Scale Digital Experiment Platforms for Scientific Discovery</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Robust digital experimentation platforms have become increasingly pervasive at major technology and e-commerce firms worldwide. They allow product managers to use data-driven decision-making through online controlled experiments that estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) relative to a status quo control setting and make associated inferences. As demand for experiments continues to grow, orthogonal test planes (OTPs) have become the industry standard for managing the assignment of users to multiple concurrent experimental treatments in companies using large-scale digital experimentation platforms. In recent years, firms have begun to recognize that test planes might be confounding experimental results, but nevertheless, the practical benefits outweigh the costs. However, the uptick in practitioner-led digital experiments has coincided with an increase in academic-industry research partnerships, where large-scale digital experiments are being used to scientifically answer research questions, validate design choices, and/or derive computational social science-based empirical insights. In such contexts, confounding and biased estimation may have much more pronounced implications for the validity of scientific findings, contributions to theory, building a cumulative literature, and ultimately practice. The purpose of this Issues and Opinions article is to shed light on OTPs—in our experience, most researchers are unaware of how such test planes can lead to incorrect inferences. We used a case study conducted at a major e-commerce company to illustrate the extent to which interactions in concurrent experiments can bias ATEs, often making them appear more positive than they actually are. We discuss implications for research, including the distinction between practical industry experiments and academic research, methodological best practices for mitigating such concerns, and transparency and reproducibility considerations stemming from the complexity and opacity of large-scale experimentation platforms. More broadly, we worry that confounding in scientific research due to reliance on large-scale digital experiments meant to serve a different purpose is a microcosm of a larger epistemological confounding regarding what constitutes a contribution to scientific knowledge.</content>
