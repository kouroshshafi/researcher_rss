    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bankruptcy reforms that improve lenders’ ability to recover claims from financially distressed borrowers can mitigate zombie lending. However, we show that after a 2016 bankruptcy reform in India, lenders are reluctant to recognize zombie credit as nonperforming, impeding reform efficacy. A subsequent complementary regulation targeting lender discretion in recognizing nonperforming assets improves zombie recognition fivefold. The lender disincentive to recognize zombies arises from undercapitalized banks’ reluctance to realize loan losses and political economy frictions at state-owned banks. Resolving zombie credit allows lenders to redirect credit to healthy borrowers, but effects are muted at banks more exposed to zombie borrowers.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Funding: The authors are grateful for financial support provided by the NSE-NYU Stern Initiative on the Study of Indian Capital Markets.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01356 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Work experiences and political participation outside work are intrinsically linked. Management scholars have acknowledged the role that organizations play in shaping political behavior from a firm-level perspective, but the specific working conditions and how they translate into employee political participation and attitudes outside work remain poorly understood. This paper offers an interdisciplinary review of the empirical literature from the past 25 years across the management and political science disciplines. It examines how individual work-related experiences (broadly categorized into job content, working environment, employment characteristics, and social relations at work) relate to political engagement outside of work: political participation, political attitudes, political trust, and political values. The results show that enabling work experiences (e.g., more skill use, autonomy, higher income, more social interactions) and experiences that caused grievances (e.g., more job or financial insecurity) were both related to more political participation but differed in their effect on political trust and regarding political attitudes on economic and cultural issues. We also review the main theoretical explanations and consolidate contradictions. Finally, we propose a future research agenda, calling for the expansion of theoretical lenses, a focus on individual-level explanatory mechanisms, and more multilevel research.</content>

    <title>The Affective Revolution in Entrepreneurship: An Integrative Conceptual Review and Guidelines for Future Investigation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurial affect has emerged as a burgeoning area of study, with a wealth of articles demonstrating that affect, broadly conceptualized, plays an important part in entrepreneurial life. While a few affective phenomena, such as passion and positive and negative affect, are primarily driving the affective revolution in entrepreneurship, a wide range of additional forms of affect, from momentary feelings to enduring affective dispositions, have been found to influence entrepreneurs’ judgments, decision-making, attitudes, and behaviors in distinct parts of the entrepreneurial process. Moreover, entrepreneurs’ affective experiences and displays of these experiences influence entrepreneurial behaviors and investors’ decision-making. Although this is an exciting time for work on entrepreneurial affect, several theoretical and empirical inconsistencies impede further knowledge accumulation. To assess how and why affect is critical to entrepreneurship, to clarify the theoretical inconsistencies, and to provide an integrative framework, we conduct a systematic review of 276 published empirical and conceptual articles on entrepreneurial affect. In doing so, we analyze how various affective phenomena (e.g., emotions, moods, sentiments), along with their discrete forms (e.g., anger, grief, happiness), influence and are influenced by specific stages of the entrepreneurial process. We conclude that while this body of research confirms that entrepreneurship is an emotional endeavor, the collective approach has thus far obscured a more detailed and useful understanding of affect in each stage of the entrepreneurial process. We examine the theoretical and empirical approaches taken to date and lay out an agenda for future scholars, thus bolstering the affective revolution in entrepreneurship.</content>

    <title>When does historical context matter? Explaining the emergence of competence-creating subsidiaries</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite thorough attention to how context shapes subsidiary behavior, very little IB research has explored the dynamic impact of disruptive changes in historical context on organizational innovations in MNEs. Existing IB theory has robustly theorized the growth of competence-creating subsidiaries from the 1980s to the 2000s. However, our historical research demonstrates that this body of existing theory fails to explain an equally significant growth in subsidiaries with protean competence-creating characteristics from 1945 to 1970. We show that the introduction of the U.K. National Health Service in 1948 precipitated a major upgrade of research capabilities among a near majority of the population of subsidiaries in U.K. pharmaceuticals by 1970. Synthesizing from both IB and literature on historical methods, we analyze the impact of this disruptive transformation in context, identifying the specific mechanisms that produced the rapid growth in what we identify as proto-competence-creating subsidiaries. This occurred in response to a dramatically new context, in ways that differ from those predicted by current theoretical explanations, and led to an institutional innovation hitherto unknown to IB. The implications of this are significant in a contemporary moment of rapid institutional disruption, when existing conceptualizations of subsidiary behavior may increasingly fail to capture real-world dynamics.</content>

    <title>Leveraging the capabilities of multinational firms to address climate change: a finance perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Climate change and the associated issue of curbing carbon emissions have risen on the agenda of policymakers worldwide. However, global coordination on matters such as harmonized regulation has been subject to significant political frictions, and the large intergovernmental transfers needed to finance the transition of developing economies have proven hard to raise. Recently, there have been considerable responses to climate change from the private sector, with stakeholders placing more pressure on firms, and financial markets mobilizing increasingly more capital towards the reduction of negative externalities. We argue that although multinational enterprises (MNEs) have been a major contributor to the problem, they can be an important part of the solution – they have unique features that enable them to play an important role in the fight against climate change. MNEs have extensive and efficient internal markets for governance, financing, and technology, which enable them to circumvent country-specific frictions to climate action such as heterogeneous regulation, corruption, and the lack of technology. We analyze how different public and private incentive mechanisms could be designed to leverage MNEs’ unique features, realign their incentives, and engage their potential to play a role in decarbonizing the economy. Lastly, we discuss challenges, opportunities, and future research.</content>

    <title>Bank Regulation, Investment, and Capital Requirements Under Adverse Selection</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the optimal design of bank capital regulations when capital markets are subject to adverse selection. I show how the implementation of capital requirements can eliminate the information frictions that make raising capital costly by screening banks to reveal their private information to the market. The optimal regulations induce information revelation via recapitalization programs when the banking sector is weak and pool the banks’ private information via uniform capital requirements otherwise. Optimal capital requirements are linked to the securities issued to meet them, demonstrating potential welfare gains from incorporating more and less informationally sensitive securities into the design of capital regulations. Finally, the analysis generates insights for the joint design of equity capital requirements and additional tier 1 capital securities. (JEL D82, G21, G28)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and the accompanying societal and economic benefits will greatly depend on how much liability AV firms will have to carry for accidents involving these vehicles, which in turn impacts their insurability and associated insurance premiums. Across three experiments (N= 2677), we investigate whether accidents where the AV was not at fault could become an unexpected liability risk for AV firms, by exploring consumer perceptions of AV liability. We find that when such accidents occur, the not‐at‐fault vehicle becomes more salient to consumers when it is an AV. As a result, consumers are more likely to view as relevant counterfactuals in which the not‐at‐fault vehicle might have behaved differently to avoid or minimize damage from, the accident. This leads them to judge AV firms as more liable than both firms that make human‐driven vehicles and human drivers for damages when not at fault.</content>

    <title>Breaking Through Only to Break up: A Cross‐Country Analysis of the Speed of Advancement and Exit of Female Executives</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the speed of advancements and exits of female executive directors vis‐à‐vis comparable men. In line with recent research, we suggest that women are likely to experience an apparent gender‐based advantage in the form of lower age at the time of their first‐ever executive director appointment. However, we argue that this advantage may be transitory. Appointed women also experience faster exits from these positions, with age partially mediating the differential speed of exits between male and female executive directors. We also contend that these effects are contingent on countries' local gender norms (especially women's economic participation) such that lower gender parity leads to even lower ages at appointments and faster exits for female executive directors. Results based on 15,202 unique rookie executive directors from 33 countries between 2002 and 2015 largely support these predictions.</content>

    <title>Building Micro‐Foundations for Positive Workplace Relationships: Validation of a Strategic Relational Human Resource Management Measure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A growing number of studies have recognized the pivotal role of relational Human Resource Management (HRM) systems in fostering positive interpersonal relationships in the workplace. These systems are tailored to fulfill specific relational objectives through collective‐level mechanisms. However, there has been a notable neglect of strategies for establishing the general foundations of positive workplace relationships and the contributions of individual actors in relationship‐building activities. Drawing upon the multilevel micro‐foundational structure framework and strategic human capital theory, this study introduces and validates a new measure of strategic relational HRM (SRHRM) systems. This measure incorporates a set of interrelated HRM practices aimed at reinforcing individual employees' relational knowledge, skills, and abilities, which serve as micro‐foundations for the development and maintenance of workplace relationships. Our methodology encompasses a meticulous validation process for the SRHRM measure. This involves employing four diverse samples from North America and Asia to assess its content validity, internal consistency, convergent and discriminant validity, as well as criterion‐related validity. Our findings provide substantial support for the application of the SRHRM measure in future empirical investigations.</content>

    <title>The Earnings and Labor Supply of U.S. Physicians</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Is government guiding the invisible hand at the top of the labor market? We use new administrative data to measure physicians’ earnings and estimate the influence of healthcare policies on these earnings, physicians’ labor supply, and allocation of talent. Combining the administrative registry of U.S. physicians with tax data, Medicare billing records, and survey responses, we find that physicians’ annual earnings average $350,000 and comprise 8.6% of national healthcare spending. Business income comprises one-quarter of earnings and is systematically underreported in survey data. Earnings increase steeply early in the career, and there are major differences across specialties, regions, and firm sizes. The geographic pattern of earnings is unusual compared with other workers. We argue that these patterns reflect policy choices to subsidize demand for physician care, amplified by restrictions on physician entry, especially in certain specialties. Health policy has a major impact on the margin:  25% of physician fee revenue driven by Medicare reimbursements accrues to physicians personally. Physicians earn 8% of public money spent on insurance expansion. These policies in turn affect the type and quantity of medical care physicians supply, retirement timing, and the allocation of talent across specialties.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Design and Analysis of Efficient Sequencing Policies for Linear Cold Storage Devices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we investigate the problem of sequencing data requests for linear devices, such as magnetic tapes, to minimize response time in cold-storage solutions for archival data. Tapes are the technology of choice for long-term storage due to their reliability, low costs, security, and significant energy savings. However, physical limitations on tape pose challenges to policy implementation, which must be scalable on low-power hardware. We provide a theoretical and numerical analysis of existing policies and introduce new ones, identifying cases where each is applicable and evaluating their theoretical performance in terms of the number of requested files. In particular, we show that the standard first-in, first-out (FIFO) policy can be arbitrarily inefficient and investigate novel constant-ratio approximations and polynomial-time procedures. If data on the frequency with which each file is accessed is available, we consider a dynamic programming procedure to minimize a stochastic variant of the problem, providing a constant-time approximation for arbitrary file requests. We also investigate a quality criterion based on makespan and explore online variants of the problem. Our numerical analysis, conducted on both synthetic and real-world data from an industry partner, offers insights into when each policy is most appropriate, identifying cases where the proposed algorithms significantly outperform traditional policies, like FIFO, in terms of average reading times. This study has managerial implications, as current data retrieval practices in data centers are often limited to traditional policies with unknown theoretical performance. Our methodological and numerical analysis provides evidence of the value in appropriately sequencing requests based on tape structure, guiding algorithm choice and highlighting underlying trade-offs in response times.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Quality, Necessity, or Accessibility? Impact of Dockless Bike Sharing on Ineffective Use of Medical Resources</title>
    <updated>2025-01-14T14:39:21.266901+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In recent years, patients have increasing autonomy in medical decision-making. With great autonomy in selecting medical institutions, patients with low-risk diseases (LRD) may opt for treatment in prestigious hospitals, which limits the access of patients with high-risk diseases (HRD) to these hospitals. Moreover, due to limited medical knowledge and a fear of uncertainty regarding diseases, patients with greater medical autonomy may request various unnecessary medical tests to alleviate their health-related anxiety. This study takes a novel patients’ perspective to investigate how dockless bike sharing, which addresses the “last-mile problem” and improves geographical accessibility to medical institutions, affects two types of ineffective use of medical resources: disease-institution mismatch and overuse of medical tests. By introducing the concept of quality-accessibility trade-off in patients’ decision-making processes, we shed light on the psychological mechanism underlying the effect of dockless bike sharing on patients’ medical institution choices. We also introduce a new concept, perceived necessity of medical tests, to explain how dockless bike sharing reduces unnecessary medical tests. In Study 1, we designed a quasi-experiment and applied a difference-in-differences model based on real-world electronic health record data to show that dockless bike sharing increased the likelihood of patients choosing hospitals over clinics and decreased the number of unnecessary medical tests. In Studies 2a, 2b, 3a, and 3b, four randomized controlled experiments were employed to replicate the findings and reveal the underlying mechanisms. In sum, we found that dockless bike sharing acted as a “double-edged sword” in terms of its impact on exacerbating disease-institution mismatch and alleviating the overuse of medical tests. This study makes significant theoretical contributions to the Operations Management (OM), sharing economy, and medical resource management literature. It also offers important managerial insights for governments, shared mobility platforms, and healthcare providers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Designing E-commerce Livestreams: How Product Presentation Duration Affects Sales?</title>
    <updated>2025-01-14T14:39:21.266870+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Livestream e-commerce has emerged as a novel way to promote and sell products. This channel differs from existing promotion channels like TV/ online video advertising because viewers voluntarily consume the content on this channel and are highly engaged due to social interactivity with the livestreamer and other viewers. A key design aspect of product promotions is the duration for which a product is presented during a livestream session. In this paper, we empirically study the impact of product presentation duration by analyzing a unique dataset from two of the largest livestream shopping platforms in China. We find that when the product duration is longer, product revenue is higher. However, as the average presentation time increases, the session revenue decreases. The role of presentation duration in driving sales may differ between official (single-brand) livestreams sponsored by brands and third-party (multi-brand) livestreams. On analyzing the heterogeneous effects between official and third-party livestreams, we find that the positive impact on product-level sales is largely driven by third-party livestreams. On the other hand, both official and third-party livestreams can improve session-level sales by reducing the average product duration in a session. Thus, in the context of third-party livestreams, we observe a tension between the incentives of the brands (advertisers) whose goal is to drive an individual product’s sales and third-party livestreamers whose goal is to maximize total sales in a session. Our findings have useful implications for the design of e-commerce livestreams.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the multi-armed bandit framework, there are two formulations that are commonly employed to handle time-varying reward distributions: adversarial bandit and nonstationary bandit. Although their oracles, algorithms, and regret analysis differ significantly, we provide a unified formulation in this paper that smoothly bridges the two as special cases. The formulation uses an oracle that takes the best action sequences within a switch budget. Depending on the switch budget, it turns into the oracle in hindsight in the adversarial bandit and the dynamic oracle in the nonstationary bandit. We provide algorithms that attain the optimal regret with the matching lower bound. The optimal regret displays distinct behavior in two regimes.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Impact of Industrial and Geographical Concentrations of Upstream Industries on Firm Performance During COVID-19</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a large sample of supplier-firm relationships, we develop new measures to operationalize the industrial and geographical concentrations of firms' upstream industries. The developed measures show an upstream industry might be competitive and contain many suppliers (low industrial concentration) and yet be concentrated in a few countries (high geopolitical concentration) or a small geographical area (high geographical concentration), thus leaving the downstream firm vulnerable to geographical or geopolitical disruptions. Using COVID-19 as an exogenous shock, we document that the firms whose upstream suppliers are operating in industries that have high concentration (either geographically or geopolitically), on average, experienced a reduction of 250 million US dollars in quarterly sales. Thus, competitive industries with ample suppliers may still impose significant risks on downstream firms if the upstream suppliers' industries are concentrated mainly in a few countries or small geographical areas. Noteworthy, we find evidence that the link between upstream suppliers' industry-level concentrations and downstream firms' sales growth is heterogeneous. Specifically, firms can mitigate the negative relationship by adjusting their supply chain networks. The negative relationship is weaker for firms with a geopolitically diversified supply base and firms with more domestic suppliers. Our estimates are robust and consistently identified through several different empirical strategies. Our findings help policymakers and managers to systematically identify locations in supply networks that have the potential to create bottlenecks that may even threaten national security. Additionally, the proposed measures give policymakers insights into which industries to support for onshoring.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a model in which a low monetary policy rate lowers the cost of corporate debt, potentially spurring productive investment; low interest rates, however, also induce firms to lever up so as to increase payouts to equity. Whereas such leveraged payouts privately benefit shareholders, leverage comes at the social cost of distorting their incentives, thereby lowering productivity and discouraging investment. If leverage is unregulated (for example, because of the presence of a shadow banking system), then the optimal monetary policy seeks to contain such socially costly leveraged payouts by stimulating investment in response to adverse shocks only up to a level below the first best. The optimal monetary policy may even consist of leaning against the wind, that is, not stimulating the economy at all, in order to fully contain leveraged payouts and maintain productive efficiency.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01440 .</content>

    <title>Using Subsidies, Fines, and Restitution with Budget Balance to Combat Digital Piracy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite utilizing technical prevention methods and enacting copyright protection legislation, digital piracy has remained a persistent problem. We examine policy remedies to digital piracy whereby the policymaker has to balance its budget between fines on detected pirates, subsidies for legal purchases, and restitution to the firm. In our model, users choose whether to subscribe, copy, or not use the good, a firm decides on subscription fee and quality, and a policymaker determines subsidies, fines, and restitution. We find that the firm’s subscription fee is always increasing in subsidies, fines, and restitution under a budget balance constraint. The impact of these policy instruments on the firm’s investment in quality depends on how user marginal utility is influenced by the quality of the good and how the policymaker redistributes fines back to society, if at all. Using two specific functional forms with additive and multiplicative utility, we explain how these factors come into play. With additive utility, fines increase the firm’s investment in quality. However, with multiplicative utility the firm’s investment in quality decreases with fines if fines are used alone or alongside subsidies. In contrast to prior research, findings of our general framework illustrate that imposing fines on detected pirates “can” be socially optimal when accounting for the policymaker’s budget balance. Our specific functional forms also serve as two instances where imposing fines is always welfare maximizing. Finally, we find that although the policymaker’s optimal intervention improves social welfare and mitigates digital piracy, it leads to a reduction in consumer surplus.This paper was accepted by Hemant Bhargava, information systems.Funding: This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [Grant 435-2016-0431].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03463 .</content>

    <title>ChatGPT for Textual Analysis? How to Use Generative LLMs in Accounting Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative large language models (GLLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 by OpenAI, are emerging as powerful tools for textual analysis tasks in accounting research. GLLMs can solve any textual analysis task solvable using nongenerative methods as well as tasks previously only solvable using human coding. Whereas GLLMs are new and powerful, they also come with limitations and present new challenges that require care and due diligence. This paper highlights the applications of GLLMs for accounting research and compares them with existing methods. It also provides a framework on how to effectively use GLLMs by addressing key considerations, such as model selection, prompt engineering, and ensuring construct validity. In a case study, I demonstrate the capabilities of GLLMs by detecting nonanswers in earnings conference calls, a traditionally challenging task to automate. The new GPT method achieves an accuracy of 96% and reduces the nonanswer error rate by 70% relative to the existing Gow et al. (2021) method. Finally, I discuss the importance of addressing bias, replicability, and data sharing concerns when using GLLMs. Taken together, this paper provides researchers, reviewers, and editors with the knowledge and tools to effectively use and evaluate GLLMs for academic research.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: Supported by the Foster School of Business – University of Washington.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03253 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Product Returns and Assortment Decisions: a Strategic Analysis of Online and Offline Competition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present a model of product returns and assortment decisions in the context of online-offline retail competition. In equilibrium, the online store optimally offers easy-to-fit products to reduce costly returns. The competing brick-and-mortar store faces a subtle trade-off between generating higher sales and attracting more foot traffic, and thus, it might use its limited store size to stock harder-to-fit products. Our model provides a rationale for the prevalence of relatively lower-quality products sold online and the steady growth of specialty stores within the changing footprint of traditional retailing. The model is extended to include possibilities such as a physical store opening an online channel to compete with the online store.We apply this framework to investigate the possibility and consequences of retailers collaborating to handle returns. Specifically, a recent “buy online and return in store” (BORS) return policy allows consumers to return online purchases directly to a competing brick-and-mortar store. In the short run, BORS increases the BMR’s foot traffic and the returns volume. In the long run, BORS expands the OR’s assortment and increases BMR’s foot traffic. BORS can be sustained in the long run if the BMR is small or if its cost-saving effect is large.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: From Streetwear to High Fashion: How Nonelite Producers Use Hybridization to Enter an Elite Category</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Gaining access to elite categories is challenging for nonelite producers. My longitudinal analysis of the evolution of the fashion market explains how some nonelite streetwear producers gained access to the elite high fashion category by creating an interstitial hybrid category—luxury streetwear—that bridged the two. Nonelite producers create a hybrid category by establishing commensurability with the elite category and generating appeal through cultural consonance. The hybrid category challenges the elite boundary while potentializing value creation for elites. In response, elite producers subsume the hybrid category, which resolves the challenge posed by nonelite producers and allows elites to capture the value introduced by nonelites by absorbing and exerting control over them. By doing so, elite producers rejuvenate their category’s cultural relevance and strengthen its elite status, while some nonelite producers gain access to the elite category. I contribute to research by theorizing nonelites’ status gains through categorical hybridization, an empirically prevalent but undertheorized phenomenon. I then leverage my theoretical insights to explain why subsumption solves cooptation issues, distinguish between collective and collaborative market driving, suggest that market actors can concomitantly participate in market maintenance and change, and offer managerial recommendations for nonelites to solidify status gains.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Observations of product and service reviews suggest that textual product reviews may contain statements that talk about the overall experience (“We had a great time”) or, similarly, whether to recommend a particular product. We argue that such statements encapsulate an overall assessment and hence are not independently informative about, but rather reflect overall ratings. We propose a model that allows for the distinction between topics that contribute to and topics that merely reflect an overall evaluation and apply it to a data set consisting of luxury hotel reviews. Compared to a standard supervised LDA, we find our model to better fit the data and to improve customer insights by resulting in more semantically coherent topics which point at specific aspects with positive and negative relationships to customers' evaluation of their experience.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Customers would frequently benefit from changes to an existing purchase contract with a supplier (e.g., due to a wrong order). Salespeople can voluntarily make such a change, which we label a “customer-centric contract change.” Formally, we define a customer-centric contract change as an act of a salesperson of amending the purchase contract in the customer’s favor without a legal obligation to do so. Since literature has neglected this prevalent and important phenomenon, we draw on social exchange theory to study the impact of such contract changes on relationship performance. Toward this end, we leverage panel data on over 57,000 customers, four experiments, and a survey study. Results suggest customer-centric contract changes increase relationship performance because customers are grateful for a salesperson’s relinquishing of power. Interestingly, this effect is less pronounced in close exchange relationships where a norm of solidarity between customers and salespeople exists. These findings add to emergent work that finds that business partners in close exchange relationships expect each other and are willing to forgo power advantages to alleviate each other’s hardships; we integrate these findings into what we coin “power-solidarity theory.” For practitioners, the findings offer guidance on whether and how to approve contract change requests.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research on status signaling reveals that consumers may select subtle or overt signals to convey their social status. In this research, the authors build on this insight in the context of auditory signaling and show that consumers use product volume as a status signal. Using the Dominance-Prestige Account of Rank Allocation framework, the authors propose that the path consumers take to achieve status will influence their choice of loud or quiet products. A combination of quantitative models, a lab experiment and a conjoint study demonstrates that consumers pursuing status via dominance are more likely to choose relatively louder products, while those who use a prestige path are more likely to choose relatively quieter products. The authors further demonstrated a boundary condition for prestige-driven consumers, the presence of other signals of social rank, such as education or profession. When no other markers of their social rank are present prestige-driven people reduce their preference for quiet signals (Study 4).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The blockchain technology can generate decentralized consensus, hence enhancing the verifiability and contractability of payoff-relevant states in a distribution channel or supply chain (e.g., seller cost and/or buyer value). Therefore, smart contracts can be written between supply chain partners such that transactions are automatically executed at state-dependent prices. We examine the economic impacts of blockchain-enabled smart contracts on the equilibrium generation and allocation of surplus in a three-level supply chain. Our model highlights the role of smart contract in removing ex post asymmetric decision right, which is otherwise inherently present under regular contracts where trade decisions are made based on constant transfer prices. As a result, the seller (under cost uncertainty) or the buyer (under value uncertainty) may hurt itself by signing a smart with the middleman, despite the improvement in the supply chain's total efficiency and surplus. Therefore, the equilibrium choice of smart contract can be socially insufficient. Moreover, interestingly, a prisoner's dilemma may arise: the seller's and the buyer's dominant choice is the regular contract, whereas everyone would be better off if the smart contract is jointly adopted by all parties.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Natural Affect DEtection (NADE): Using Emojis to Infer Emotions from Text</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Emotions are central to consumer communications, and extracting them from user-generated online content is crucial for marketers, considering that such consumer opinions significantly shape brand perceptions, influence purchase decisions, and provide essential insights for marketing analytics. To leverage vast user-generated data, marketers and researchers require advanced text-to-emotion converters. However, existing tools for fine-grained emotion extraction face several limitations: Lexica are constrained by their dictionaries, machine learning models by human-annotated training data, and large language models by insufficient validation. As a result, marketing research still tends to rely on mere sentiment detection instead of extracting more nuanced emotions from text. This paper introduces Nade (Natural Affect DEtection), a novel text-to-emoji-to-emotion converter that first “emojifies” language and then converts these emojis into intensity measures of well-established, theory-grounded emotions. This approach addresses the limitations of existing tools by leveraging the inherent emotional information in emojis. Using human raters and state-of-the-art converters as benchmarks, the authors establish the benefits of exploiting emojis, validate Nade, and demonstrate its use in several marketing applications using data from various social media platforms. Users can apply the proposed converter through an easy-to-use online app and programming packages for Python and R.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The author explores how racial alignment between film critics and movie casts affects critic ratings and their market implications. Testing the hypothesis of cultural affinity, this research finds that critics’ ratings tend to decrease as the proportion of Black cast members increases, but this effect is mitigated when the critic is Black. A text analysis of critics’ review excerpts suggests the presence of two tenets of cultural affinity: cultural literacy and cultural identity. An online survey further demonstrates that, in the absence of self-selection, Black respondents perceive greater affinity toward movies featuring predominantly Black casts and assign higher ratings to trailers featuring racially similar casts. Two additional analyses show that critic ratings have market consequences: as the proportion of Black cast members rises, critic ratings diverge more from audience choices (box office revenue) and audience ratings, though this effect is mitigated when the critics are Black. These findings underscore the importance of racial diversity in promoting culturally representative content in the marketplace.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As artificial intelligence (AI) transforms society, understanding factors that influence AI receptivity is increasingly important. The current research investigates which types of consumers have greater AI receptivity. Contrary to expectations revealed in four surveys, cross country data and six additional studies find that people with lower AI literacy are typically more receptive to AI. This lower literacy-greater receptivity link is not explained by differences in perceptions of AI’s capability, ethicality, or feared impact on humanity. Instead, this link occurs because people with lower AI literacy are more likely to perceive AI as magical and experience feelings of awe in the face of AI’s execution of tasks that seem to require uniquely human attributes. In line with this theorizing, the lower literacy-higher receptivity link is mediated by perceptions of AI as magical and is moderated among tasks not assumed to require distinctly human attributes. These findings suggest that companies may benefit from shifting their marketing efforts and product development towards consumers with lower AI literacy. Additionally, efforts to demystify AI may inadvertently reduce its appeal, indicating that maintaining an aura of magic around AI could be beneficial for adoption.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We empirically analyze firm‐level uncertainty generated from extreme weather events, guided by a theoretical framework. Stock options of firms with establishments in a hurricane's (forecast) landfall region exhibit large implied volatility increases, reflecting significant uncertainty (before) after impact. Volatility risk premium dynamics reveal that investors underestimate such uncertainty. This underreaction diminishes for hurricanes after Sandy, a salient event that struck the U.S. financial center. Despite constituting idiosyncratic shocks, hurricanes affect hit firms' expected stock returns. Textual analysis of calls between firm management, analysts, and investors reveals that discussions about hurricane impacts remain elevated throughout the long‐lasting high‐uncertainty period after landfall.</content>

    <title>Navigating the Talent Retention Puzzle: The Role of Workgroup Identification and On‐the‐Job Embeddedness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations implement talent management (TM) programs to improve retention. However, results are mixed on whether these programs reduce talent turnover. Applying the social identity theory, we predicted that talent nomination in a TM program reduces workgroup identification and increases turnover intention. We also hypothesized that on‐the‐job embeddedness mitigates this unintended effect. Our three‐wave survey study, conducted over 2 years with 352 employees at a multinational machinery manufacturing company in China, included 45 employees recently identified as talents. Results showed that talents had lower workgroup identification than their non‐talent peers, but this did not lead to higher turnover intention. We found that on‐the‐job embeddedness had a moderating role: talents with low embeddedness reported lower workgroup identification and higher turnover intention than non‐talents, whereas those with high embeddedness showed no such difference. This study highlights that TM programs can prompt thoughts of leaving among talents; however, job embeddedness can buffer these negative effects.</content>

    <title>Redesign of Virtual Power Plant-led Electricity Demand Response Program</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As the scale of renewable energy on the demand side continues to grow, a new demand response program (DRP), the virtual power plant (VPP), pays a rebate to the consumer and purchases his rooftop solar electricity. This electricity is dispatched to areas of electricity shortages, which is vital in balancing electricity loads and avoiding energy waste. However, the new DRP differs from the traditional DRP in terms of paying rebates. The traditional DRP requires consumers to respond above a specified baseline to receive a rebate. In contrast, in the new DRP, consumers can receive a rebate even if their response is small (i.e., no baseline). There is no research that addresses this divergence. Therefore, we construct a supply chain consisting of a consumer and a VPP for this novel DRP and analyze the strategic interactions between them in two situations where a baseline is not set/set. Our results show room for improvement in the DRP that dispatches electricity generated from rooftop solar. If the consumer generates more electricity from rooftop solar, the baseline, rather than frustrating the consumer, motivates the consumer to be more responsive. While the baseline also discourages the demand response process, it reduces the emissions generated from the consumer’s over-responsiveness. Additionally, our study suggests that a baseline, whether it facilitates or hinders the DRP, could benefit the VPP, depending on the business model of the VPP. In addition, we add several extensions to demonstrate the robustness of our model.</content>

    <title>On the Disclosure of Defensive Posture: Adversarial Belief Formation and Target Selection Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Due to the strategic and adaptive nature of adversaries, the deployment of new technologies is common practice in the arenas of security and defense (e.g., new baggage scanners at airports). History has shown that the deployment of these technologies has often been disclosed to the public, allowing malicious actors to potentially understand which venues are defended, and how. There is limited research examining how information disclosed about the deployment of new security measures can impact the beliefs and decisions of adversaries. Studying these beliefs and decisions is critical in obtaining insights into adversarial behavior, which can inform the allocation of defensive resources and the design of related information disclosures. This article aims to address this gap by studying how people—who are motivated to attack one among multiple targets—respond when receiving information from a defender regarding the deployment of new security measures at those targets. We address whether attackers (i) believe the information they receive from the defender and (ii) choose to attack after learning that new security measures may be deployed at their target(s) of interest. We find that attackers’ beliefs regarding where new security measures are deployed, and their decisions to attack particular targets, are impacted by the information they receive from the defender and by their understanding of the defender’s target valuations, highlighting the importance of strategic information disclosure in counterterrorism operations. In an experimental setting with two targets, when attackers ([Formula: see text]) knew that the defender valued one target much more than the other, they had a stronger belief that security measures would be deployed at the higher-value target, even when the defender announced that only the lower-valued target was protected with enhanced security. We also identify important factors that increase the likelihood of deterrence (i.e., when adversaries decide not to attack), which is a major goal in counterterrorism operations. Overall, this study provides novel insights into information disclosure and adversarial decision making in security and defense contexts, contributing to the operations management and behavioral decision analysis research in this domain.</content>

    <title>How to Leverage Digital Platforms in Preventing Industrial Accidents: Evidence from a Multi-Level Empirical Study</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The embeddedness of digital platforms in firms to improve industrial accident prevention performance remains a challenge for safety management. A pressing question exists regarding appropriate pathways to improve firm accident prevention performance by leveraging digital platforms. Prior research focuses on individual and organizational factors to prevent industrial accidents while ignoring information technology (IT) from a holistic perspective. Following a socio-technical lens, this study fills the research gap by proposing a new conceptualization of technical and institutional components and examining their combined effects in shaping individual and organizational accident prevention outcomes (i.e., employee accident prevention competence and firm accident prevention performance). Specifically, we introduce and conceptualize the concept of digital platform affordance to represent the technical component and theorize the external institutional force ( government pressure) and the internal human agency ( top management support) as the institutional components of digital platforms. By integrating the socio-technical lens, IT affordance theory, and institutional theory, we develop a theoretical model to examine the interaction effects between digital platform affordance, government pressure, and top management support on accident prevention performance. We conduct a multilevel modeling approach to test the proposed research model using a fine-grained matched-pair survey from multiple respondents (i.e., employees and safety executives) in 161 industrial firms in China. We find that digital platform affordance enhances firm accident prevention performance by improving employee accident prevention competence. The results also indicate that the magnitude of the moderating effect of government pressure is contingent upon top management support. This study conceptualizes and assesses the role of digital platforms in safety management and indicates that the amalgamation of their technical/institutional components is a promising means to prevent industrial accidents. We also provide a new perspective for Operations Management scholars to reinterpret the socio-technical lens in the emerging digitally enabled safety management subdiscipline.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the operations of a novel service model, mobile charging, in which an e-commerce platform operator dispatches trucks equipped with charging piles to provide charging services for customers’ electric vehicles with low battery levels. We model the platform-customer interaction with a Stackelberg game and explicitly characterize customers’ optimal charging decisions under the platform’s various service plans. In a general scenario that involves charging requests within a transportation network, we develop a joint optimization model for the platform’s pricing and service fulfillment, utilizing an elaborately constructed augmented network. In addition, we explore a localized subproblem where multiple orders are concentrated within a specific region. With a simplified model structure, we propose an approximation algorithm with provable performance guarantees and further theoretically evaluate the resource consumption and associated platform benefits for serving the orders in each region. The results enable the batching of neighboring demands within the general scenario as a specialized node, resulting in a streamlined network with fewer nodes. Additionally, we can enhance the algorithm’s efficiency within the general framework through strategic prioritization of node visitations, leveraging the analytical findings. Furthermore, the insights derived can offer recommendations for the deployment of mobile charging and the selection of target areas in the initial stages. Overall, our study provides comprehensive guidelines and valuable insights for mobile charging operations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dynamic treatment regimes improve health outcomes by tailoring each treatment to a patient’s evolving condition, but they also allow providers to learn and game the system over time. How should insurers pay? We study this new class of reimbursement problems, where the provider can privately learn and manipulate the progression of the patient’s condition. (i) We characterize the optimal payment policy: it internalizes two intertemporal effects of each treatment, and rewards provider honesty with incentive pay; moreover, it admits a simple implementation of risk-adjusted cost-sharing policy. (ii) We show that, ignoring dynamic learning and gaming, the existing payment models may have overestimated the harm of information asymmetry. Using the optimal policy, insurers only need to pay for initial private information; they can exploit provider uncertainty and elicit future private information at no cost. (iii) Our study informs U.S. healthcare payment reform with new insights; using two sets of real data, our study also quantifies when and why the optimal policy outperforms the existing ones. By highlighting the critical role of dynamic learning and gaming, this study advances our understanding of healthcare payment theory and practice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Offering bespoke products is the cornerstone of many competitive manufacturing strategies. The challenge for production control is allocating materials to individualized orders before they can be released to the shop floor. This requires joint evaluation of material inventory and workload control. However, these topics have been studied in isolation for [Formula: see text] years, under the presumption of a hierarchical control design. This traditionally had the practical advantage of a reduced need for real-time system information. With the advancements in Industry 4.0, control functions can now be integrated. We amalgamate knowledge from both disciplines, present hierarchical and integrated production control designs, and formulate material inventory policies tailored to pulled order release. Using simulation, we show that a decentralized and integrated production control design drastically reduces cost (at least 15%) and improves delivery performance in various settings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using sociotechnical systems (STS) theory, this article offers a critical perspective on how the interplay between social and technical systems in supply chains can be leveraged to gain valuable insights into addressing risks related to modern slavery. It elaborates on the complex recursive interactions among various elements of STS, shedding light on the emergence, perpetuation, and diffusion of modern slavery, as well as the sociotechnical interventions available within supply chains. We develop a framework that conceptualizes the risk of modern slavery as the outcome of interactions among multiple systems, providing guidance for future research, policy development, and managerial strategies to address this pressing societal challenge. Importantly, multistakeholder initiatives, combining innovative approaches to both social and technical governance, are expected to play a crucial role in mitigating modern slavery risks.</content>

    <title>Markovian Pricing With Price Guarantees</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A stream of recent research considers the practice of random price discounts (a.k.a randomized pricing) when selling to forward-looking customers and shows that such pricing strategies can mitigate strategic customer waiting and boost seller profit. In practice, random price discounts are often offered together with price guarantees, in which customers are refunded the price difference if the price is lowered within a given time window after purchase. This paper investigates the efficacy of price guarantees under randomized pricing. To that end, we consider a model in which a firm adopts Markovian pricing and interacts with customers over an infinite time horizon. The following results are obtained. First, while Markovian pricing allows firms to price discriminate customers based on their monitoring costs, price guarantees further allow firms to price discriminate customers based on their willingness to pay. Second, offering price guarantees under Markovian pricing can help retain customers effectively by inducing high-valuation customers to purchase early, regardless of their arrival time. Third, even with price guarantees, Markovian pricing can dominate static pricing only when high-valuation customers are more likely to have a high monitoring cost, which illustrates that customer composition plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of the firm’s pricing strategy. Fourth, the optimal duration of price guarantees is closely related to customers’ lifetime duration. Finally, perhaps surprisingly, offering price guarantees can decrease the aggregate customer surplus since the firm offers sale prices less often under price guarantees.</content>

    <title>How Psychological Barriers Constrain Men’s Interest in Gender-Atypical Jobs and Facilitate Occupational Segregation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scholarship regarding occupational gender segregation has almost exclusively focused on women’s experiences (e.g., as targets of discrimination in masculine domains), yet understanding factors that perpetuate men’s underrepresentation in traditionally feminine occupations is equally important. We examine a consequential dynamic early in the job search process in which individuals come to learn that an occupation that fits them is perceived as feminine versus masculine. Our research develops and tests the prediction that femininity or masculinity of occupations will exert a stronger impact on men’s (versus women’s) interest in them such that men will be less interested in gender-atypical occupations than women. Across five studies (n = 4,477), we consistently observed robust evidence for this prediction among diverse samples, including high school students (Study 1), unemployed job seekers (Study 2), U.S. adults (Study 3), and undergraduates (Study 4) and using experimental and archival methods. We observed this asymmetry after controlling for alternative accounts related to economic factors (e.g., expected salary), suggesting that they alone cannot fully explain men’s lack of interest in feminine occupations as previously discussed in the literature. Further, we consistently observed that men, compared with women, show heightened sensitivity to gender-based occupational status, and this greater sensitivity explains men’s (versus women’s) reduced interest in gender-atypical occupations. Though past scholarship suggests that increasing pay is key to stoking men’s interest in feminine occupations, our research suggests that targeting men’s underlying psychological concern—sensitivity to gender-based occupational status—may be an underappreciated pathway to reducing gender segregation.Supplemental Material: The data, materials, preregistration, and ancillary analyses for all studies are available at https://osf.io/h4mgx/?view_only=9a4dbfc9d122417c880354d6b3462072 and at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17550 .</content>

    <title>Joint Bottom-up Method for Probabilistic Forecasting of Hierarchical Time Series</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a stark departure from conventional wisdom, Nicolò Bertani, Shane T. Jensen, and Ville A. Satopää’s recently published research article titled “Joint Bottom-up Method for Probabilistic Forecasting of Hierarchical Time Series” dismantles a long-held belief in hierarchical forecasting: that the hierarchical structure itself contains vital information. The joint bottom-up (JBU) method proves otherwise. The authors demonstrate that the sums within a hierarchy—often seen as critical—add no additional information beyond what is contained in the most granular, bottom-level series. By modeling these bottom-level series jointly, JBU leverages their dependencies to deliver probabilistic forecasts that are both coherent and highly accurate across all levels of aggregation. This groundbreaking insight challenges decades of hierarchical forecasting practices. It underscores that upper-level series can be entirely reconstructed from the bottom-level series, rendering the hierarchy redundant. This finding, validated through real-world applications, sets a new standard for forecasting in fields like retail, energy, and tourism. Explore the full study to understand its far-reaching implications.</content>

    <title>Things at Work: How Things Contribute to Performing Work</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A crucial question for organizations is what constitutes work performance. While the importance of human competence and motivation to work performance has been established, less well understood is how ‘things’ – such as algorithms, tools, instruments, and raw materials – contribute to work performance. As ‘intelligent’ and ‘agentic’ technologies become further involved in work, it is increasingly important to understand the impact of things upon work performance. Although research adopting an entanglement perspective (e.g., practice theory, sociomateriality, affordances, science and technology studies) has convincingly demonstrated things are integral to work performance, there is a need for heightened clarity onhowthings contribute to performing work. Informed by an ontology of things and drawing on an ethnographic study in the biotechnology industry, we propose things are constitutive of work performance in three interrelated ways: (1) by belonging to a nexus of useful things, (2) through performing interlinked roles, and (3) while co‐constituting work performance in concert with practitioners. Our theoretical and empirical account offers a moreintegrativeandcomprehensive understandingof how things are constitutive of work performance compared to the existing entanglement literature. This opens several new possibilities for enhancing work performance in organizations, which we outline in the paper.</content>

    <title>On the Folly of Rewarding Your Version of Performance: Signaling and the Double Empathy Problem in Pay‐For‐Performance Across Neurotypes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As many organizations have sought to increase their neurodiversity, they have tended to focus on human resource (HR) practices and programs for increasing representation, especially of autistic employees. There has been comparatively less attention regarding HR practices that relate to sustaining employment and fostering workplace performance for autistic employees. Sustaining employment is a particular challenge because the signals sent by HR practices and the neurotypical managers implementing them are often differently interpreted by autistic employees—the double empathy problem. As the pay practices and pay‐for‐performance (PFP) systems critical to retention and career advancement have increasingly broadened beyond objective assessments of task performance to include more subjective assessments and contextual performance, the double empathy problem can worsen leading to unintended negative consequences. We draw upon signaling theory to theorize how and when PFP worsens or mitigates the double empathy problem. Specifically, we develop a model and set of propositions that posit how the attributes of signals (observability, consistency, and frequency), the resulting shared relevance of signals, their effects on behavior, and managers' subsequent interpretations of employee behavior and performance form a cycle through which performance‐reward signals tighten or loosen and, in turn, affect autistic employee well‐being and turnover. We close by discussing how our model may apply to other forms of neurodivergence and implications for future research regarding the practices, signals, and interpretations that create or inhibit environments supportive of neurodiversity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a finite sample inference method for the structural parameters of the semiparametric binary response model under a conditional median restriction originally studied by Manski (1975, 1985). This is achieved by exploiting distributional properties of observable outcomes conditional on the observed sequence of exogenous variables. Moment inequalities conditional on the size n sequence of exogenous covariates are constructed, and the proposed test statistic is a monotone function of violations of the corresponding sample moment inequalities. The critical value used for inference is provided by the appropriate quantile of a known function of n independent Bernoulli random variables, and does not require the use of a cube root asymptotic approximation employing a point estimator of the target parameter. Simulation studies demonstrate favorable finite sample performance of the test in comparison to several existing approaches. Empirical use is illustrated with an application to the classical setting of transportation choice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The dynamics of random transitive delegations on a graph are of particular interest when viewed through the lens of an emerging voting paradigm: liquid democracy. This paradigm allows voters to choose between directly voting and transitively delegating their votes to other voters so that those selected cast a vote weighted by the number of delegations that they received. In the epistemic setting, where voters decide on a binary issue for which there is a ground truth, previous work showed that a few voters may amass such a large amount of influence that liquid democracy is less likely to identify the ground truth than direct voting. We quantify the amount of permissible concentration of power and examine more realistic delegation models, showing that they behave well by ensuring that (with high probability) there is a permissible limit on the maximum number of delegations received. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the delegation process is similar to well-known processes on random graphs that are sufficiently bounded for our purposes. Along the way, we prove new bounds on the size of the largest component in an infinite Pólya urn process, which may be of independent interest. In addition, we empirically validate the theoretical results, running six experiments (for a total of N = 168 participants, 62 delegation graphs, and over 11,000 votes collected). We find that empirical delegation behaviors meet the conditions for our positive theoretical guarantees. Overall, our work alleviates concerns raised about liquid democracy and bolsters the case for the applicability of this emerging paradigm.This paper was accepted by Martin Bichler, market design, platform, and demand analytics.Funding: This work was supported by the Michael Hammer Fellowship, the Office of Naval Research [2016 Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, 2020 ONR Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, and Grant N00014-20-1-2488], the Office of Secretary of Defense [Grants ARO MURI W911NF-19-0217 and ARO W911NF-17-1-0592], Simons [Investigator Award 622132], the Open Philanthropy Foundation, and the National Science Foundation [Grants IIS-178108, CCF-1733556, CCF-1918421, CCF-2007080, IIS-1703846, and IIS-2024287].

    <title>Timing Complex News to Target Attention</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Investors have limited and time-varying attention. These constraints are heterogeneous across investors, which can create asymmetric information and adverse selection problems. We show how firms take these constraints into account: They release harder-to-process news in periods when investor attention is higher. We use an institutional discontinuity within the U.S. corporate filing system to measure these effects. Filings before 5:30 p.m. become available immediately, whereas filings after 5:30 p.m. only become visible the next morning and attract less attention. Firms release longer and more complex news just before the cutoff, giving investors the longest possible period to absorb the information before markets open. Firms experience faster price convergence and more liquidity after precutoff news despite their complexity, which is consistent with the additional attention that they attract. We outline a framework in which the need for investors to spread their attention across different ideas induces firms to file their more complex filings at times when investor attention is higher. Our results are consistent with an equilibrium in which investors pay more attention to complex news and in which firms with complex news time them to target investor attention.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03722 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Inflation Reduction Act establishes a new 15% corporate minimum tax on the adjusted financial accounting income for large U.S. corporations. Although the minimum tax is estimated to raise $222 billion over 10 years, some fear firms will manipulate their accounting earnings to reduce their tax liabilities, resulting in less revenue raised. Using an event study, we examine the extent to which investors believe this tax will reduce firm value. We examine stock market reactions around key legislative developments leading to the enactment of the book minimum tax. Our findings show targeted firms experience significantly lower stock returns than nontargeted firms during the enactment process (about 1.4%–1.8% of firm value). In aggregate, our findings are consistent with the Joint Committee on Taxation’s revenue estimates. In cross-sectional tests, we fail to find evidence that firms most likely to avoid the tax via earnings management experience more positive returns. We also fail to find less negative returns for firms most likely to pass on the tax to consumers. Overall, our results suggest investors do not expect firms to avoid this tax. Instead, they appear to expect a significant portion of the corporate minimum tax to be remitted by firms and borne by shareholders.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: F.

    <title>The High Cost of Cheap Talk: How Disingenuous Ethical Language Can Reflect Agency Costs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does the use of a certain type of ethical language indicate that managers are failing to behave in a socially responsible manner? Managers are increasingly using language related to ethics, values, and corporate purpose in their communications with stakeholders. However, while economic models argue that “talk is cheap,” we predict that some ethical language (i.e., cheap talk) can reflect agency costs. That is, cheap talk reflects managers being disingenuous with stakeholders about their ethical intentions in order to reduce pressure on corporate social performance (CSP). We test this prediction by inductively creating a dictionary of cheap talk words and demonstrating that the use of cheap talk in annual reports (10-Ks) is associated with decreasing CSP. We also examine how monitoring by stakeholders concerned about CSP (specifically, security analysts and women board membership) can reduce this effect, and how certain types of executive compensation (specifically, exercisable and non-exercisable options) can either alleviate or worsen this effect. We contribute to the cheap talk literature (a subset of the impression management literature) by showing the high cost of disingenuous ethical language (i.e., cheap talk). We also add to the literature distinguishing between “values” and “legal” ethical talk by showing in post hoc analyses that words reflecting values are more likely to be cheap talk.</content>

    <title>Silent Suffering: Using Machine Learning to Measure CEO Depression</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a novel measure of CEO depression by applying machine learning models that analyze vocal acoustic features from CEOs' conference call recordings. Our research was preregistered via theJournal of Accounting Research's registration‐based editorial process. In this study, we validate this measure and examine associated factors. We find that greater firm risk is positively associated with CEO depression, whereas higher job demands are negatively associated with CEO depression. Female and older CEOs show a lower likelihood of depression. Using this novel measure, we then explore the relationship between CEO depression and career outcomes. Although we do not find any evidence that CEO depression is associated with CEO turnover, we find some evidence that turnover‐performance sensitivity is higher among depressed CEOs. We also find limited evidence of higher compensation and higher pay‐performance sensitivity for depressed CEOs. This study provides new insights into the relationship between CEO mental health and career outcomes.</content>

    <title>Unmasking Mutual Fund Derivative Use</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using new SEC data, we study fund derivative use and its impact on performance. Despite small portfolio weights, derivatives contribute largely to fund returns. Contrary to prior research, we find most employ derivatives to amplify, not hedge, equity returns. Using machine learning to classify funds’ derivative strategies reveals high specializations linked to information-related trading, liquidity management, gaining exposure, or hedging motives. Long index derivative users drive the amplification. During COVID-19, these users significantly increased derivative use more than others and shifted strategies, but initially lost on existing positions and then on newly opened short positions when markets unexpectedly rebounded.

    <title>Inference with a Single Treated Cluster</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I introduce a generic method for inference about a scalar parameter in research designs with a finite number of heterogeneous clusters where only a single cluster received treatment. This situation is commonplace in difference-in-differences estimation but the test developed here applies more broadly. I show that the test controls size and has power under asymptotics where the number of observations within each cluster is large but the number of clusters is fixed. The test combines weighted, approximately Gaussian parameter estimates with a rearrangement procedure to obtain its critical values. The weights needed for most empirically relevant situations are tabulated in the paper. Calculation of the critical values is computationally simple and does not require simulation or resampling. The rearrangement test is highly robust to situations where some clusters are much more variable than others. Examples and an empirical application are provided.</content>

    <title>DOES A THEORY-OF-VALUE ADD VALUE? EVIDENCE FROM A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL WITH TANZANIAN ENTREPRENEURS</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs making decisions under uncertainty are encouraged to evaluate their initial ideas through hypothesis testing, but entrepreneurial approaches vary in their emphasis on ex-ante theory development prior to collecting evidence. In this paper, we examine whether and how entrepreneurs benefit from adopting an evidence-based approach or a theory-and-evidence-based approach to decision-making. We conducted a field experiment with Tanzanian agribusiness entrepreneurs by randomly assigning entrepreneurs to two different training conditions. We find that entrepreneurs in the theory-and-evidence-based condition have higher economic performance during the observation period following the intervention. We conjecture this result stems from differences in the types of changes enacted: entrepreneurs in the theory-and-evidence-based training make more coordinated changes that encompass both core and operational elements of their business models.</content>

    <title>How Social Movements Catalyze Firm Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the impact social movements have on firm innovation through private politics. We argue that firms strategically respond to private politics by investing in new technologies that address movement-advocated issues material to firms’ performance. While both contentious private politics—when activists contentiously target firms—and cooperative private politics—when activists and firms collaborate—catalyze innovation, they do so in different ways. Contentious private politics increases the amount of innovation firms undertake by drawing managerial attention to movement-advocated issues material to the firm prompting search for solutions to those issues. Conversely, cooperative private politics provides firms access to new knowledge which encourages firms to search for solutions in areas more distant from their existing knowledge, in so doing, increase innovation involving distant recombination on material issues. We find support for our arguments in a matched sample of firms contentiously targeted, and with activist collaborations, on climate change issues, and firms that were not targets of private politics on those issues but had otherwise similar histories of climate-related innovation and relationships with climate movements and other environmental movements. Supplementary analyses corroborate the mechanisms that undergird our theoretical predictions: contentious private politics is associated more innovation closer to a firm’s expertise while cooperative private politics is associated with innovations that draw on more distant knowledge. We also find that when collaboration follows contention their respective impacts on innovation are reduced which may result from firms seeking collaborations for their legitimacy-granting benefits after contention rather than the learning opportunities they offer.</content>

    <title>Where A/B Testing Goes Wrong: How Divergent Delivery Affects What Online Experiments Cannot (and Can) Tell You About How Customers Respond to Advertising</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Marketers use online advertising platforms to compare user responses to different ad content. But platforms’ experimentation tools deliver different ads to distinct and undetectably optimized mixes of users that vary across ads, even during the test. Because expo­sure to ads in the test is nonrandom, the estimated comparisons confound the effect of the ad content with the effect of algorithmic targeting. This means that experimenters may not be learning what they think they are learning from ad A/B tests. The authors document these “divergent delivery” patterns during an online experiment for the first time. They explain how algorithmic targeting, user heterogeneity, and data aggregation conspire to confound the magnitude, and even the sign, of ad A/B test results. Analytically, the authors extend the potential outcomes model of causal inference to treat random assignment of ads and user exposure to ads as separate experimental design elements. Managerially, the authors explain why platforms lack incentives to allow experimenters to untangle the effects of ad content from proprietary algorithmic selection of users when running A/B tests. Given that experimenters have diverse reasons for comparing user responses to ads, the au­thors offer tailored prescriptive guidance to experimenters based on their specific goals.</content>

    <title>AI–Human Hybrids for Marketing Research: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as Collaborators</title>
    <updated>2025-01-14T14:39:21.265196+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The authors’ central premise is that a human–LLM (large language model) hybrid approach leads to efficiency and effectiveness gains in the marketing research process. In qualitative research, they show that LLMs can assist in both data generation and analysis; LLMs effectively create sample characteristics, generate synthetic respondents, and conduct and moderate in-depth interviews. The AI–human hybrid generates information-rich, coherent data that surpasses human-only data in depth and insightfulness and matches human performance in data analysis tasks of generating themes and summaries. Evidence from expert judges shows that humans and LLMs possess complementary skills; the human–LLM hybrid outperforms its human-only or LLM-only counterpart. For quantitative research, the LLM correctly picks the answer direction and valence, with the quality of synthetic data significantly improving through few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation. The authors demonstrate the value of the AI–human hybrid by collaborating with a Fortune 500 food company and replicating a 2019 qualitative and quantitative study using GPT-4. For their empirical investigation, the authors design the system architecture and prompts to create personas, ask questions, and obtain responses from synthetic respondents. They provide road maps for integrating LLMs into qualitative and quantitative marketing research and conclude that LLMs serve as valuable collaborators in the insight generation process.</content>

    <title>Inscribing Impact: Measurement Practices in the Making of Moral Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Moral markets, designed to generate positive impact on pressing social and environmental challenges, are transforming traditional market practices by including more than economic considerations in their operations. The importance of these markets continues to grow as investors, regulators, and consumers increasingly put pressure on companies to account for their broader social and environmental impacts. However, the absence of standardized norms and tools to measure impact may erode trust and lead to ‘impact washing’. This paper examines the process of impact inscription – how actors embed their principles, objectives, and values into artefacts such as measurement tools that shape moral market practices. Drawing on qualitative, in‐depth data from Spain's emerging impact investing market, we unpack impact inscription and identify three key mechanisms: demarcating moral market boundaries, accounting for social issues, and redefining governance structures. By driving changes in scope, roles, and incentives, these mechanisms influence the emergence of moral markets and can result in either disruptive change (with the risk of paralysis) or incremental change (with the risk of goal displacement). Our study also prompts a deeper reflection on how measurement tools embed value judgments, shaping how markets internalize social and environmental externalities and integrate them into market exchanges.</content>

    <title>Redaction as Cross‐Regulatory Disclosure Avoidance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce the idea of cross‐regulatory disclosure avoidance, whereby firms attempt to counteract expansions of disclosure under one regulation through actions that reduce disclosure under a different one. We study whether firms redact information from material contracts when they face new rules to disclose segment information. Using SFAS No. 131 as a plausibly exogenous shock to segment disclosure, we find that firms increasing the number of reported segments after the rule change exhibit a greater increase in redaction than firms maintaining the same number of segments. Consistent with proprietary cost motives, the increases are concentrated among firms with greater divergence in profitability across segments, higher abnormal segment profitability, and more negative abnormal stock returns in response to the finalization of the rule. Also, treated firms that redact after the rule change have abnormally profitable segments that they previously did not disclose. Firms that observables predict would increase redaction but did not experience declines in sales growth and profit margin. We find no evidence that agency cost motives drive the increases in redaction or, more generally, nondisclosure of segment performance before SFAS No. 131.</content>
