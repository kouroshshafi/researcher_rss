    <title>Beyond Money: Incentive Effects of Tokenized Ownership on User Contribution in &lt;scp&gt;DAOs&lt;/scp&gt;</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Blockchain technologies have catalyzed the rise of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which operate in an incentive network fueled by crypto tokens. In essence, these tokens are imbued with either payment rights (i.e., transactional tokens) or ownership rights (i.e., governance tokens). The decentralized organizational paradigm dismantles the traditional management structure and bring new research opportunities to Operations Management (OM). While the performance of DAOs has been largely examined in current OM literature, the effectiveness of their internal incentive mechanisms—specifically the one that uses ownership as rewards to promote user contributions—remains unclear. Focusing on DAO‐enabled virtual communities, we seek to examine whether decentralized ownership provides stronger incentives for user behaviors, such as creation and curation, in comparison to traditional monetary rewards through the lens of psychological ownership theory. We obtained data fromSteemitthat captures the reward, creation, curation and transaction behaviors of 98,000 users from May 2017 to April 2019. By leveraging the “power‐up” action as a shock that increases user ownership shares, we established a quasi‐experimental setting. Employing the PSM‐DID model, we found that the use of governance tokens is associated with enhanced creation and curation efforts but declined creation novelty, compared to the use of transactional tokens. Our additional analyses further reveal that the incentive effects of governance tokens diminish over time. However, upon the recurrence of the intended choice, these effects become reinforced. Notably, we find that governance token ownership is more strongly associated with curation efforts for users with weaker social ties. Conversely, for users with high reputation scores, their content creation behaviors are less strongly associated with governance token ownership. This study contributes to the burgeoning discourse on blockchain and cryptocurrency from an operational perspective, providing valuable insights for the design of incentive mechanisms in DAOs and advancing our understanding of operational efficiencies and stakeholder engagement in decentralized structures within Operations Management.</content>

    <title>Shock Anticipation: Voluntary Turnover by Foreign Directors in Response to Sanctions on Peer Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a new turnover mechanism, namelyshock anticipation, which explains how the anticipation of potential shocks triggers voluntary turnover by individuals in organizations. Drawing on the context of US sanctions on China initiated in 2018, we analyse a sample of foreign directors (FDs) from Chinese‐listed firms between 2014 and 2021. We suggest sanctions on peer firms lead FDs to anticipate potential sanctions on their own organizations and become concerned about the associated negative effects on their careers, which in turn motivates their turnover. We further argue that FDs at state‐owned enterprises (SOEs) anticipate a higher risk and, consequently, are more likely to leave after observing sanctions imposed on their peer firms. In contrast, FDs with shorter career horizons are less inclined to leave as they perceive diminished damage to their future career. Our empirical results provide robust support for these hypotheses. This study enriches the literature on turnover and sanctions while also offering practical implications.</content>

    <title>Turning Task-Adjusted Temporary Newcomers into Permanent Employees: An Identity Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While most of the socialization literature has focused on factors that allow newcomers to adjust to their new job tasks successfully, less attention has been given to examining whether temporary newcomers’ task adjustment influences the likelihood of receiving a permanent position. Drawing on the identity perspective and the socialization literature, this study proposes and tests a new framework that examines the probability of task-adjusted newcomers receiving a permanent job offer contingent on two conditions: a) there is a low level of peer divestiture socialization, which enables the task-adjusted newcomer to achieve higher levels of task performance, and b) the newcomer displays low rule-following behavior, which allows the high-performing newcomer to be cognitively trusted by the supervisor. Consistent with our predictions, the results of a four-wave, multisource study featuring 194 newcomer-supervisor dyads revealed that newcomer task adjustment was positively related to the newcomer receiving a permanent job offer by way of newcomer task performance and supervisor trust in newcomers but only when peer divestiture socialization and newcomer rule-following behavior were low. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of these findings.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Enhancing Attraction Experiences through Home Sharing: Evidence from Customer Review Analytics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Customer experiences largely define the success of service operations. As home sharing continues to change how consumers travel and penetrate local markets, we study the impact of home sharing on customer experiences at local travel attractions. Our empirical strategy hinges on the staggered rollout of home sharing across attractions at times. We first find that home sharing positively affects customer experiences at attractions. Using large-scale property-level customer reviews, we then trace down individual review-level content features describing host support that can explain the impact of home sharing on attraction experiences. Specifically, the mechanism centers on local travel support from hosts who provide saving tips, share attraction knowledge, and facilitate travel planning while consumers stay at their home sharing properties. We further explore the intriguing heterogeneity of home sharing impact, unveiling the unintended consequence of overtourism, especially at nationally renowned attractions and during peak season. Finally and fortunately, host support manifests to mitigate the negative impact of home sharing and remains a potential solution to address overtourism. Collectively, these findings add evidence to the sophisticated roles of home sharing in local markets and provide timely implications on customer experience management to service operation practitioners and attraction stakeholders.</content>

    <title>Designing E-commerce Livestreams: How Product Presentation Duration Affects Sales?</title>
    <updated>2025-02-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Livestream e-commerce has emerged as a novel way to promote and sell products. This channel differs from existing promotion channels like TV/online video advertising because viewers voluntarily consume the content on this channel and are highly engaged due to social interactivity with the livestreamer and other viewers. A key design aspect of product promotions is the duration for which a product is presented during a livestream session. In this article, we empirically study the impact of product presentation duration by analyzing a unique dataset from two of the largest livestream shopping platforms in China. We find that when the product duration is longer, product revenue is higher. However, as the average presentation time increases, the session revenue decreases. The role of presentation duration in driving sales may differ between official (single-brand) livestreams sponsored by brands and third-party (multi-brand) livestreams. On analyzing the heterogeneous effects between official and third-party livestreams, we find that the positive impact on product-level sales is largely driven by third-party livestreams. On the other hand, both official and third-party livestreams can improve session-level sales by reducing the average product duration in a session. Thus, in the context of third-party livestreams, we observe a tension between the incentives of the brands (advertisers) whose goal is to drive an individual product’s sales and third-party livestreamers whose goal is to maximize total sales in a session. Our findings have useful implications for the design of e-commerce livestreams.</content>

    <title>On the Design of a Shared Waiting Room</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the design of a waiting area of a service system where different types of customers seek different services, provided by designated servers. We examine two waiting room designs: The designated waiting room, where each server has its own designated waiting area, and the shared waiting room, where all customers are waiting together. In the designated waiting room design, customers observe the number of customers waiting for each service, whereas in the shared waiting room, customers cannot distinguish which service the other customers are waiting for, but can still observe the total number of customers in the waiting room and make a joining/balking decision accordingly. Assuming two types of customers that have similar characteristics seeking service from two different servers, we show that all customers adopt an identical pure equilibrium threshold. We find the shared waiting room design achieves higher throughput than the designated waiting room design when the congestion rate is low. However, the designated waiting room is always preferable in terms of social welfare. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the asymmetric case, where types differ from each other in terms of arrival rate, service reward, per unit-time waiting cost, and service duration. Finding the equilibrium strategies in these cases is more challenging and requires an iterative process. We show that mixed equilibrium thresholds can emerge, and that the designated waiting room does not always improve system performance, even when considering social welfare.</content>

    <title>Investor Learning in Crowdfunded Supply Chain Finance Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crowdfunded Supply Chain Finance (SCF) represents a novel market design that transforms financial flows within the SCF paradigm. It enables crowd investors to serve as financers, lending vital working capital to suppliers facing liquidity problems. A distinctive feature of this market is the mandatory involvement of loan guarantors, which facilitates repeated interactions between investors and fundraisers, potentially fostering investor learning. To understand how such learning dynamics shape investor decision-making, we develop a Bayesian learning model that conceptualizes investor perceptions of guarantor reliability as a subjective attitude underlying the perceived risk of a loan listing. The model posits that investors can learn about a guarantor's reliability through a series of scheduled repayments involving the same guarantor over time. We consider investor decision-making a joint process comprising two interdependent components: (a) the incidence decision of whether to invest and (b) the amount decision of how much to invest. Our results reveal that investor perceptions of guarantor reliability play a crucial role in shaping both decisions, albeit in distinct ways. While perceived reliability exerts a positive, monotonic effect on amount decisions, its impact on incidence decisions follows an inverted U-shaped pattern. Furthermore, perceived reliability attenuates the positive effect of loan interest rates on both decisions, suggesting that the appeal of higher returns diminishes as investors’ reliability perceptions increase. A posterior analysis further shows that offering high interest rates may become counterproductive when perceived reliability is sufficiently high. These findings provide actionable implications for platform designers and participants in crowdfunded SCF markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How we manage operations—the domain of Operations Management (OM)—has important implications for the practice of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in organizations. Conversely, DEI goals have important implications for organizations’ OM practices. We outline the two-way links between DEI and OM to offer future research opportunities. In particular, we examine interactions between OM and DEI across four broad themes: (1) Workforce, (2) Supply Chains, (3) Health and Society, and (4) Technology, Platforms, and Innovation. We conclude with a discussion of DEI in OM as it relates to research and teaching. This article is a collaborative effort with the Senior Editors involved in the special issue of Production and Operations Management on “DEI in Operations and Supply Chain Management.”</content>

    <title>The Resilience of Fashion Retail Stores</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Retail stores are an essential sales channel in the economy. What makes them resilient to external shocks? We propose a conceptual framework in which resilience is determined by (a) the intrinsic stability of the customer pool that the store serves and (b) the actions the store implements to cope with external shocks. We apply our framework to study the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on thousands of fashion stores across the world, using a novel high-frequency scraping method to infer daily sales. Our results indicate a severe impact of lockdown regulations, with remarkable store-level heterogeneity. Stores of smaller size, in high-income lower-density areas, catering to non-touristic demand, and not located in shopping malls were intrinsically more resistant to external shocks. Furthermore, stores that chose to be more differentiated (reduced assortment similarity) and to keep a fresher inventory (faster inventory days) were also able to attenuate the impact of the pandemic. Our framework can be useful for policymakers, who are interested in identifying and targeting most vulnerable businesses, as well as managers, who would like to build a network of stores sufficiently resistant to shocks.</content>

    <title>MT-GPD: A Multimodal Deep Transfer Learning Model Enhanced by Auxiliary Mechanisms for Cross-Domain Online Fake News Detection</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The proliferation of fake news, more recently multimodal fake news, poses a significant threat to individuals, organizations, and society. While online social media platforms have employed automated methods to combat fake news, they face two notable challenges: the scarcity of labeled data and the diversity of news domains. To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of online platforms in mitigating the spread of fake news, this study proposes MT-GPD (multimodal deep transfer learning with gating network, model patch, and domain classifier) for cross-domain fake news detection. MT-GPD integrates three novel design artifacts as auxiliary mechanisms for enhancing multimodal deep transfer learning, including a gating network that captures the relative importance of textual and visual components of individual news articles for dynamic fusion; a customized model patch that balances detection performance and computational efficiency; and a domain classifier that adapts multimodal representations to a target news domain. We evaluate the performance of MT-GPD using news datasets spanning four different domains. The results demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of MT-GPD, providing strong evidence for the impacts of the proposed auxiliary mechanisms on improving fake news detection performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Modeling Cooperative and Noncooperative Incentives in Investment Projects: A Novel Approach Using Cooperative Game Theory and Real Options TheoryIn “Dynamic Stability of Cooperative Investment under Uncertainty,” Ketelaars, Borm, and Kort study an investment project involving multiple stakeholders. The research was prompted by the fact that many infrastructure projects, such as Feyenoord City in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and the new Berlin airport, failed or were significantly delayed. Recognizing that the various stakeholders have outside options, the authors combine concepts from cooperative game theory and real options to analyze a coalitional and dynamic stability concept. They characterize the proportional investment scheme as the scheme that maximizes total project value and results in the earliest investment timing. They show that dynamic stability can be present when the market is stable and when the market is growing and volatile. However, the proportional investment scheme is more sensitive to dynamic instability in a market with high profit growth and low profit uncertainty, or vice versa.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage the unique institutional feature that the Israeli government bond market operates on an exchange rather than over-the-counter to analyze whether and why having an exchange affects market liquidity during a crisis. We document how the liquidity crisis in March 2020 affected the Israeli government bond market and conduct difference-in-differences analyses, comparing bid-ask spreads in exchange markets, such as the Israeli government bond market, with markets lacking an exchange. Our findings support the idea that having an exchange enhances market liquidity. A counterfactual analysis using trade data from the Israeli exchange suggests that this is due to the ability of investors to readily provide liquidity to one another and the efficient netting of trade flows on an exchange.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02344 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Collective Identity Effect: How Group-Level Identity Influences Individual Behavior</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates group-level customer–company identification (CCI), extending social identity theory to explore how individual-level identification evolves into strong, collective group dynamics. By analyzing interconnected customer groups, the research demonstrates how these dynamics shape individual behavior and drive organizational outcomes across diverse group types. Drawing on a comprehensive, three-year data set from a national retailer, the study assesses collective CCI within these groups. The findings reveal that group-level CCI significantly influences individual CCI, which in turn affects consumer spending and share of wallet. Furthermore, the research identifies the optimal conditions for maximizing group influence, highlighting that moderately sized (10-20 members), homogenous groups that meet three to ten times per year have the greatest impact. These insights enhance the understanding of CCI by focusing on group-level effects and extending social identity theory to address the conditions under which group-level identification exerts the strongest influence. The study offers practical strategies for managers to build group cohesion, foster loyalty, and improve customer interactions by leveraging group dynamics across organizational, social, and consumer contexts.</content>

    <title>Racial Inequity in Donation-Based Crowdfunding Platforms: The Role  of Facial Emotional Expressiveness</title>
    <updated>2025-02-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Donation-based crowdfunding platforms often claim to pursue equitable outcomes for all beneficiaries, yet many face criticism for failing to do so across different demographic profiles. In response, platform managers are eager to understand how these inequities emerge and explore solutions to address them. In this research, the authors show that the degree of facial emotional expressiveness of beneficiaries in uploaded images can differentially impact donation amounts for White versus Black beneficiaries. Drawing on social vision theory, the authors propose that facial emotional expressiveness in images, combined with the beneficiary’s race, activates racial stereotypes of emotion expression that result in differential donation amounts to Black and White individuals. Analyzing a sample of 4,153 campaigns from GoFundMe between June 2021 and September 2022, along with a follow-up experiment, the authors find that higher facial emotional expressiveness is associated with significantly lower donation amounts for Black compared with White beneficiaries. Further exploring our moderating constructs reveals that the use of call-to-action cues, affective messaging, and race-gender homophily cues can attenuate the activation of stereotypes and therefore reduce differences in donation amounts between racial groups. Based on these findings, the authors offer targeted recommendations for platform managers to reduce racial inequities in crowdfunding outcomes.</content>

    <title>Goal Hierarchies: Understanding Sub‐Goal and Primary Goal Interdependency</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is increased research on how organizations respond to performance feedback on multiple goals. Most of it considers goals that have ambiguous ranking and thus differs from goal hierarchies with sub‐goals that are instrumental for accomplishing a primary goal. We develop theory on how goal hierarchies lead to primary goal and sub‐goal interactions influencing organizational decision‐making. We show that sub‐goals are important because they are temporally prior and instrumental for primary goals, making organizational responses to sub‐goals and primary goal interdependent in interesting ways. Empirically, we demonstrate a more sophisticated approach to multiple goals than earlier work suggests. This advances the behavioural theory of the firm, and supports and refines key assumptions for organizational design and organizational economics, encouraging further research on the role of goal structures and incentive schemes. Our theory and findings call for increased consideration of the March and Simon's (1958) hierarchical goals’ model in management research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how lenders design contracts to account for transitory and permanent cash flow shocks facing borrowers. We find that volatile transitory cash flow shocks are associated with fewer liquidity covenants, indicating financial flexibility that enables firms to survive liquidity crunches. The opposite is true for volatile permanent cash flow, suggesting that borrowers’ economic fundamentals are important credit risk factors. Subsequent analyses show that borrowers exposed to transitory (permanent) shocks face less (more) severe credit consequences following poor performance. Overall, we show that transitory and permanent cash flow shocks have significant and opposite effects on debt contract covenant design.</content>

    <title>Ephemeral State-Dependent Recommendation for Digital Content</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-oriented AbstractBuilding upon recent advances in consumption theories, we propose an ephemeral state-dependent framework for digital content recommendations. The framework accentuates a critical, yet understudied, interplay between a firm’s recommendation strategy (assimilation or diversification) and a consumer’s ephemeral state (fixation or foraging). The framework adaptively recommends either assimilated or diversified content based on a consumer’s ephemeral state. Through a randomized field experiment, we provide compelling evidence that state-dependent schemes can enhance engagement and revenue. Although the congruent scheme (i.e., assimilation when fixation, diversification when foraging) generally outperforms the incongruent one, contributing a 7.3% ($19.73 million) annual revenue lift for the platform, our findings underscore the necessity for nuanced personalization. Specifically, consumers with broader, more fluid preferences benefit more from the incongruent scheme (i.e., assimilation when foraging, diversification when fixation), challenging the prevailing assumption that congruence is always optimal. Our research not only adds to the theoretical understanding of consumer behavior in digital content consumption, but also offers actionable insights for designing more effective recommender systems. By accounting for consumer heterogeneity and considering the broader implications of our proposed recommendation framework, including spillover effects, our findings have the potential to influence industry practices and future academic inquiry in this rapidly evolving field.</content>

    <title>When Breaking the Law Gets You the Job: Evidence from the Electronic Dance Music Community</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why would a law-abiding occupational community support members engaged in legally prohibited actions? We propose that lawbreaking can elicit informal support when it is construed as a disinterested action—intended to serve the community rather than the perpetrator. We study how illegal remixing (“bootlegging”) affects an artist’s ability to secure opening act and other performance opportunities in the electronic dance music (EDM) community, whose members endorse the substance of copyright law but whose norms about bootlegging are ambiguous. Data on 38,784 disc jockeys (DJs) across 97 countries over 10 years reveal that producing bootlegs is associated with more opportunities to perform, compared to producing official remixes or original music. This effect disappears when community members view bootlegging as a self-serving action—primarily designed to benefit the perpetrator. An online experiment and an expert survey rule out the possibility that bootlegs are considered more creative, of higher quality, or better able to attract attention. We shed additional light on our proposed mechanism by analyzing data from 34 interviews with EDM professionals. This helps us to explain how a lawbreaker can paradoxically be perceived as serving the community, thereby eliciting active community support for their action.</content>

    <title>A Little Help from My Friends? Navigating the Tension Between Social Capital and Meritocracy in the Job Search</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Job seekers often rely on help from social ties in the search for employment. Yet the job search is characterized by meritocratic ideals according to which candidates should be selected based on their qualifications, not their connections. How do people justify the use of connections given the conflicting cultural logics of social capital and meritocracy? We conduct an inductive analysis of 56 interviews with young Spaniards experiencing a difficult labor market and identify a novel process of justification, situational alignment, that reconciles these conflicting logics. Respondents justified situations in which connections provided assistance as legitimate when they perceived alignment among the job seeker, job, and type of help that connections provided. Respondents deemed illegitimate the situations in which these were not aligned. These justifications allowed respondents to embrace the social capital logic’s prescription to use connections, while upholding the meritocratic principle that jobs be awarded based on qualifications. We further find that situations involving close ties were more readily justified than those involving distant others. We test this inductively derived process using a survey experiment with 1,536 young Spaniards. This study demonstrates that perceptions of merit are situated, and advances the understanding of social capital by identifying a novel process of justification that contributes to labor market inequality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Chief executive officer (CEO) political activism is increasing, but its strategic implications remain unclear. We conduct two survey‐based experiments to shed light on how individuals respond to CEO activism. We differentiate between communicating an apolitical stance versus saying nothing ‐ an unexplored distinction to date. We furthermore examine whether characteristics which could influence perceived credibility of the stance ‐ whether it is consistent with expectations and whether it is backed by monetary commitment ‐ influence responses. We thus contribute to a deeper understanding of whether and how individuals’ perceptions of the firm are affected by CEO activism.Managerial SummaryIt is critical for managers to understand the implications of engaging in CEO political activism, a practice which has been on the rise in recent decades. Actively communicating an apolitical stance versus passively staying silent about an issue are two separate strategic choices available to managers which have been unexplored in the literature to date. This paper sheds light on how individuals respond to firms' communicating an apolitical stance, saying nothing, or taking an ideological stance in either direction on a political issue; and how this varies depending on whether the stance is perceived as consistent with expectations and whether it is backed by monetary commitment. It thus helps managers navigate stance‐taking on political issues.</content>

    <title>Channel Structures for a Dual-Purpose Firm: Direct, Retail, or Hybrid?</title>
    <updated>2025-02-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The advance in e-commerce has provided firms with more options when designing their channel structures. The rise of “beyond profit” managerial doctrine has also added complexity to channel design. Extending the literature in distribution channels that focuses on for-profit firms, this paper develops a stylized model to examine the channel design problem for a socially responsible manufacturer who pursues a dual-purpose objective—the manufacturer values both profit and consumer surplus. We compare three channel structures: Direct selling (centralization), retailing only (decentralization), and the hybrid of both the direct and indirect channels. We show that double marginalization rooted in the retail channel can alleviate the manufacturer’s loss in profit due to her pursuit of consumer surplus. Thus, compared to direct selling, retailing only may lead to a higher profit for the manufacturer (even when the manufacturer’s direct channel is as efficient as the retail channel) and a higher conversion efficiency in boosting consumer surplus at the expense of the manufacturer’s profit. In the hybrid channel analysis, we show that the manufacturer’s pursuit of consumer surplus leads to upward distortion of direct sales. Facing competition from direct sales, the retailer becomes less sensitive to the wholesale price, and the manufacturer has to reduce the wholesale price significantly to boost the retailer’s order quantity, leading to serious downward wholesale price distortion when the consumer focus is high. Counterintuitively, we find that as the selling cost disadvantage in direct selling increases, the manufacturer with a higher consumer focus increases the wholesale price to rely more on direct selling. We also find that the hybrid structure may cause loss in profit due to price and quantity distortions, leading to lower manufacturer utility and conversion efficiency compared to the single-channel structures. We also provide several extensions to show the robustness of our main findings and offer further insights for channel design for dual-purpose organizations.</content>

    <title>Degeneracy Is OK: Logarithmic Regret for Network Revenue Management with Indiscrete Distributions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The network revenue management problem is a fundamental problem in online decision making with resource constraints. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to deriving near-optimal policies for the network revenue management problem with a theoretical guarantee better than the classic $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret. Logarithmic or better regret has been derived, however, with an additional nondegeneracy assumption that requires the underlying fluid approximation to enjoy a unique optimal basis. This work relaxes the nondegeneracy assumption and achieves logarithmic regret for network revenue management problems for general indiscrete reward distribution. To achieve these advances, this work develops several new techniques, including a new method of bounding myopic regret, a semifluid relaxation of the off-line allocation, and an improved bound on the dual convergence, which has the potential to inspire other works. All in all, this work takes a fundamental step toward relaxing the nondegeneracy assumption, which traditionally limits the scope of online algorithms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Unveiling Hidden Shifts: Detecting Change Points in Dynamic Networks with Missing LinksDynamic networks are ubiquitous in a world increasingly driven by interconnected systems from social media platforms to financial transactions, transportation systems, and cybersecurity infrastructures. Unlike static entities, these networks evolve, often undergoing abrupt structural changes. Detecting these changes is essential as they can signal critical events, such as cyberattacks or shifts in user behavior.The challenge becomes even greater when dealing with incomplete data, a common reality in large-scale networks. Missing links, from nonresponses or privacy concerns, create uncertainty, complicating the identification of structural changes.The paper “Change-Point Detection in Dynamic Networks with Missing Links” tackles this issue with a robust framework based on the matrix CUSUM test statistic. This novel methodology is adaptable to expanding networks and resilient to missing data. It detects structural shifts with minimax optimality, ensuring theoretical robustness. Extensive simulations and real-world examples reveal that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods. It provides a valuable tool for monitoring dynamic networks, detecting fraud, and spotting emerging trends.</content>

    <title>An Economic Model of a Decentralized Exchange with Concentrated Liquidity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop an economic model of a decentralized exchange with concentrated liquidity (e.g., Uniswap v3 and v4), with a particular focus on the economics of liquidity provision. We demonstrate that providing liquidity for a risky/risk-free asset pool is comparable to investing in a covered call, except that the call option therein is sold at intrinsic rather than market value. Hence, when providing liquidity, liquidity providers forgo the time premium of the call option in exchange for fees, and thus equilibrium liquidity provision decreases in the time premium. Finally, we provide an expression for equilibrium liquidity provision that is useful for empirical work.This paper has been This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong for the Special Issue on Digital Finance.</content>

    <title>The Role of Inclusive Leadership: In Reducing Disability Accommodation Request Withholding</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Workplace disability accommodations are intended to help level the playing field and create more accessible, inclusive workplaces. Yet, research shows that people with disabilities often experience insufficient accommodations as a result of both employers’ and employees’ attitudes about accommodations. The current work seeks to shed new light on psychological processes underlying disability accommodation request withholding. To do so, we draw upon a relational framework and use social tuning theory to develop a model examining the relationship between inclusive leadership and accommodation request withholding, as mediated by employees’ perceived disability stigma and moderated by disability severity and relational-interdependent self-construal. We tested our model across two studies with Chinese employees—including a survey study with three waves of data from 290 employees with physical disabilities and an experimental-causal-chain designed vignette study with 526 participants. Our findings indicated that inclusive leadership was associated with employees’ lower perceived disability stigma, and that was related to reduced accommodation request withholding. Furthermore, this relationship was more pronounced in employees with higher disability severity and relational-interdependent self-construal. Our research provides novel insights for disability diversity management, particularly around the role of inclusive leadership in fostering enabling workplace environments.</content>

    <title>Distribution Strategy, Capability Investment, and Government Regulation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates how a manufacturer’s internal sourcing capability and government regulation influence the supplier’s distribution strategy and the manufacturer’s sourcing and capability investment decisions. We consider a supply chain consisting of a supplier that produces a critical component, an independent manufacturer that also has the capability to produce the component in-house, and a dependent manufacturer without such capability. We first consider a scenario in which the supplier chooses its distribution strategy—either offering its component to both manufacturers or establishing an exclusive selling agreement with a single manufacturer. We explore how the supplier’s optimal distribution strategy (dual or exclusive selling) depends on the terms and process of the contract and on the independent manufacturer’s ability to produce a high-quality component in-house. We also show that, in equilibrium, the independent manufacturer may invest in a high capability level (leading to a high-quality component) as a strategic deterrent against the supplier’s decision to engage in an exclusive selling agreement with the dependent manufacturer. We further consider a setting with mandatory exclusion, imposed by government regulation, that affects free trade among parties. We show that mandatory exclusion can exacerbate or mitigate the independent manufacturer’s incentive to invest in internal sourcing capability, relative to a setting in which the supplier determines its distribution strategy in the absence of such government regulations. Moreover, we show that mandatory exclusion always hurts the supplier, but it can benefit or hurt the manufacturers as well as the consumers, depending on the independent manufacturer’s investment cost and the conditions leading to an exclusionary contract under free trade.</content>

    <title>Managing Reusable Resources With Usage Time Limits</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In reusable resources like vehicle sharing, city parking, and hotel services, resource units are used by consecutive customers for a stochastic usage time and are made available for future customers upon return. We model such reusable resources as Erlang loss systems, where customers who find all units occupied are blocked. Customers are rational decision-makers, and their willingness to join the system depends on factors such as price, time limits, service value, and resource availability. When each customer is charged a fixed price, we examine whether it is beneficial to install time limits, which increase availability at the expense of reduced usage time. We formulate and solve a two-dimensional revenue maximization problem to optimize both the usage price and the time limit. We differentiate between on-demand resources, which are immediately reusable upon return, and reserved resources, which can only be reused after the time limit expires. With on-demand resources, setting a time limit is proven to be detrimental, making the entry price the sole tool for maximizing revenue. This conclusion remains valid when the usage time increases with the entry price. In contrast, managing reserved resources involves an interplay between time limits and entry prices. Additionally, we show that loss systems (where customers do not wait) should be managed differently from systems where customers do wait. Specifically, in systems with waiting, we prove that only the time limit should be optimized, while the entry price should capture the full market share. We prove our results by analyzing the behavior of the equilibrium arrival rate and revenue, which necessitates establishing novel properties for the blocking probability. These properties yield new sharp bounds for the blocking probability and enable us to prove the convergence of the optimized model for on-demand resources to the quality-and-efficiency-drivenregime as the number of resource units grows.</content>

    <title>Are Firms Voluntarily Disclosing Emissions Greener?</title>
    <updated>2025-02-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do firms voluntarily disclosing emissions have lower levels of greenhouse gases in their in-house and outsourced operations? We examine this question using Scope 1 and upstream Scope 3 emission data reported by firms or estimated by S&amp;P Trucost from 2002 to 2020. Our empirical results reveal that “voluntary disclosing firms” tend to have lower levels of “internal emissions” (i.e., Scope 1 emissions) and yet higher levels of “external emissions” from upstream suppliers (i.e., estimated upstream Scope 3 emissions). Overall, disclosing firms tend to have more emissions in the entire supply chain. A plausible explanation is that they may outsource more emissions to upstream suppliers than non-disclosing firms. By exploring the potential mechanisms that explain our results, we find that disclosing firms tend to exert more effort to reduce their internal emissions and outsource more carbon-intensive operations to suppliers. This finding is consistent with their decreasing Scope 1 emissions and increasing Scope 3 emissions. In addition to examining differences in emissions between high- and low-emission industries and across regions, we also investigate the implications of mandatory environmental reporting regulations by different governments and find these regulations can effectively nudge disclosing firms to reduce total emissions, including Scope 1 and Scope 3. As more regulations require the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions, our findings highlight the necessity for firms to develop processes and exert efforts to measure, monitor, and control both in-house and outsourced emissions. Additionally, our findings indicate that Environmental, Social, and Governance investment managers should perform due diligence rather than solely relying on firms that disclose their Scope 1 emissions.</content>

    <title>Institutional Ties and Publications in Top Accounting Journals</title>
    <updated>2025-02-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Academic journals certify and disseminate scientific knowledge. However, institutional ties between journals and universities can lead to conflicts of interest that compromise peer review. I consider publication patterns in the “Top 3” accounting journals in light of the journals’ governance structures and institutional ties. The Accounting Review (TAR), governed by the American Accounting Association (AAA), has no university affiliations. Journal of Accounting and Economics (JAE) and Journal of Accounting Research (JAR) are private journals with longstanding editorial ties to specific universities: the University of Rochester, the University of Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology for JAE and the University of Chicago for JAR. For publications from 2000–2022, I find that journal-affiliated authors (current faculty and recent PhDs from journal-affiliated universities) publish disproportionately in their affiliate journal. Further analysis suggests that this pattern does not appear to be attributable primarily to authors’ journal submission preferences, particularly for JAR affiliates. In fact, JAR affiliates publish their least cited work in JAR (relative to TAR and JAE), and affiliate articles in JAR receive significantly fewer citations than articles in JAR by authors from top institutions unaffiliated with JAR. Results further suggest that institutional ties may be particularly impactful for pretenure PhD affiliates and for the publication of dissertations. The results are consistent with the idea that institutional ties may influence the publication process in accounting journals, particularly at JAR, where institutional affiliations are formalized and concentrated in one institution.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04553 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Does the structure of the borrower’s equity ownership matter in debt contracting? This paper addresses this question by examining change in control clauses. These clauses are pervasive in loan contracts, yet their terms are not boilerplate. Examining 14,940 contracts, we document significant heterogeneity in the use and size of ownership caps, which limit large equity block formation. Overall, our evidence indicates that the way equity capital is distributed matters to lenders. Lenders set lower caps to mitigate risks arising from power contests among shareholders, formation of a new (coordinating) block, potentially resulting in activism, and hostile takeover threats via toehold strategies. We confirm some of these effects using two quasi-natural experiments. Caps below 50% are associated with a drop in firm value but not in the cost of debt, consistent with exacerbated firm-manager agency costs. Finally, two findings shed light on ways creditors may influence corporate governance: the largest block size increases when these minority block restrictions expire, and the likelihood of withdrawing an announced buyback increases during the life of these loans.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The internet appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04224 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce the first adaptively priced iterative combinatorial auction design, which gradually extends price expressiveness as the rounds progress. This mechanism achieves both high efficiency and fast convergence across a wide range of valuation domains. We implement our auction design using polynomial prices, show how to detect when the current price structure is insufficient to clear the market, and show how to correctly expand the polynomial structure to guarantee progress. An experimental evaluation confirms that our auction is competitive with bundle-price auctions in domains where these excel, namely multiminded valuations, but also performs well in domains favorable to linear prices, such as valuations with pairwise synergy.This paper was accepted by Axel Ockenfels, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.4993 .</content>

    <title>Rejections Are Stickier Than Choices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers frequently make the same decision repeatedly, by either choosing the products they like more or rejecting the products they like less. Holding everything else constant, does the mere act of choosing versus rejecting influence the extent to which consumers seek variety? Eight studies (N = 2,814) identify a robust effect: Consumers tend to seek less variety across repeated decisions if they make each decision by rejecting than if they make each decision by choosing. This effect occurs because an initial rejection (vs. choice) reduces the liking of the unselected option(s) and thus widens the liking gap between the selected and unselected options. An increased liking gap, in turn, decreases the consumer's likelihood of selecting a previously unselected option(s) in subsequent decisions. The findings also show that the enlarged liking gap is driven by increased negative inferences about the unselected option(s). Theoretically, this research extends the literatures on variety seeking and choosing versus rejecting. Practically, it offers implications for consumer welfare: The rejection task can improve (worsen) the decision quality in situations in which consumers typically seek too much (too little) variety.</content>

    <title>That's So Cringeworthy! Understanding What Cringe Is and Why We Want to Share It</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What does it mean for something to be cringeworthy? To date, research studying this phenomenon has been lacking. Across six studies, this research seeks to provide a better understanding of cringe, both in terms of what it is as an emotion and what it does via its downstream consequences on consumer behavior. The authors delineate conceptually and empirically how cringe is a unique form of vicarious embarrassment (i.e., embarrassment experienced in response to someone else). Specifically, they show that cringe occurs when one observes an actor—an individual, group of people, or even a brand—commit a social transgression by making an awkward attempt to form a positive impression on others in a way that is not excusable from the observer's perspective. The authors also demonstrate a novel effect of cringe: consumers respond to cringeworthy experiences by wanting to share them with others via word of mouth. This effect occurs because the act of sharing cringeworthy experiences gives consumers an opportunity for self-enhancement by engaging in a favorable downward social comparison to the actor committing the social transgression that elicited cringe. Theoretical contributions, managerial implications, and future research directions pertaining to emotion and word-of-mouth behavior are discussed.</content>

    <title>How Socioeconomic Status Shapes Food Preferences and Perceptions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article assesses the extent to which consumers from the opposite poles of the socioeconomic distribution weigh three critical food attributes (healthiness, fillingness, and taste), how they perceive the associations among them, and how differences in weights and associations influence food preferences. The results of a series of eight preregistered studies in a highly unequal environment (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) show that low- (vs. high-) socioeconomic-status consumers are more likely to (a) choose unhealthy items even when supply-side factors (e.g., affordability and accessibility) are controlled by design, (b) trade healthiness for fillingness (but not taste), and (c) display stronger negative associations between the attributes (“healthy = less filling” and “healthy = less tasty”). These findings highlight the importance of a deeper understanding of the psychological differences in food preferences and perceptions and the use of such insights to design interventions aimed at mitigating nutritional inequality. In line with this rationale, the final set of studies shows that, albeit not a trivial task, it is possible to increase healthy food choices among disadvantaged consumers by enhancing the perceived fillingness of the healthy options available. Managerial and policy implications are discussed.</content>

    <title>Beyond the Pair: Media Archetypes and Complex Channel Synergies in Advertising</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research on advertising media mixes has mostly focused on single channels (e.g., television), pairwise cross-elasticities, or budget optimization within single campaigns. This is detached from practice where (1) marketers decide between an increasingly large number of media channels, (2) media plans involve complex combinations of channels, and (3) marketers manage complementarities among many channels. The authors use latent class analysis to uncover tendencies in media allocations. Latent classes account for nonrandom selection of channels into campaigns, capture pairwise and higher-order interactions between channels, and allow for meaningful interpretation. The authors describe the most common media channel archetypes and estimate their relationship to the effectiveness of a set advertising campaigns on common brand-related performance metrics. They use a dataset of 1,083 advertising campaigns from around the world run between 2008 and 2019. While they find no single media mix that consistently correlates with high performance across all metrics, clear high-performing patterns emerge for specific metrics. The authors find that traditional channels (TV, outdoor) often appear together with digital channels (Facebook, YouTube) in high-performing campaigns. Additionally, current marketing practices appear suboptimal, with simple strategies predicted to improve lifts by 50% or more.</content>

    <title>Clarifying the Construct of Supervisor Support for Recovery and Its Impact on Employee Recovery Experiences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Insufficient recovery from work stress is a pernicious issue for many workers. This study aims to understand the important role that supervisors play in employees’ recovery experiences. Specifically, we (1) proposed an expanded conceptualization of supervisor support for recovery (SSR), and (2) developed and validated a measure consistent with this expanded conceptualization. We refined the conceptualization of SSR with four dimensions: refraining from communicating about work during nonwork time, refraining from requiring work during nonwork time, modeling recovery, and encouraging recovery. These dimensions align with the recovery literature, which highlights the necessity of refraining from recovery-hindering behaviors to reduce energy exertion and engaging in recovery-promoting behaviors to provide recovery opportunities. The recovery-promoting dimensions also align with key themes of role modeling and encouragement emphasized in social cognitive theory. Based on the conceptualization, we further developed and validated an SSR scale using three different designs (cross-sectional, supervisor-subordinate dyadic, time-separated) in six studies. Results showed that SSR was distinct from related supervisor constructs (e.g., leader-member exchange and family supportive supervisor behaviors), was positively associated with recovery experiences, and provided further insight into recovery experiences, over and above the other supervisor constructs. This study provides a foundation for future research to better understand how supervisors can support employee recovery from work stress.</content>

    <title>The spirit of the times: historical conditions and market-seeking FDI strategies by U.S. alcohol firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Market-seeking foreign direct investment (FDI) remains central for firms to expand their global presence and seize opportunities abroad. However, existing research often focuses on immediate or near-term drivers related to firms’ market-seeking FDI strategies, and thus neglects the valuable insights a historical perspective can provide. To address this gap, we draw insights from imprinting theory and propose a framework theorizing the dual-layered imprinting of historical conditions stemming from both extreme historical experiences and founding conditions. Using the U.S. alcohol industry as a research context, we employ a mixed-methods approach, integrating quantitative and qualitative techniques. Our findings reveal that firms’ experiences during extreme anti-alcohol conditions, such as Prohibition, positively correlate with regulation-driven market-seeking FDI, while firms founded in more pro-alcohol periods prioritize speed-driven market-seeking FDI. Moreover, we identify how unrelated diversification, a strategy consistent with the anti-alcohol imprint but inconsistent with the pro-alcohol imprint, affects the relationship between historical imprints and FDI strategies through imprint amplification or decay. Our qualitative analyses elucidate the role of founders’ and leaders’ strategic decision-making in reinforcing the mechanisms through which historical conditions shape FDI strategy. This longitudinal framework provides insights into imprint formation, transmission, and manifestation, accounting for contextual variations and implications for FDI strategy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether the heterogeneity of expectations is associated with idiosyncratic variations in experience. Combining household survey data and administrative data from the Netherlands, we find that given market development, households’ expectations about house price changes vary with their individual experience. This association is related to the use of information conveyed by experience, which varies in terms of informativeness, recency, and household sophistication. Finally, we find that individual experience also explains how far house price expectations deviate from realized house prices and that it may affect household behavior. Our findings elucidate the role that individual experience plays in expectation formation.</content>

    <title>Concerted Quantification: How Knowledge Workers Limit Overwork While Maintaining Client Satisfaction</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Knowledge workers are increasingly overworked, with negative consequences for both individuals and organizations. Pressures for long hours often come from clients, and the quantification of work has, in many cases, amplified these pressures. We examine when and how workers might rely upon quantification to limit overwork. We draw on data from a 21-month ethnography of information technology worker teams that develop software for clients in finance. We find that although these workers faced overwork pressures, they managed this tension through a process we label “concerted quantification.” This process has three steps. First, team members constructed quantified units based on disparate work tasks to coordinate on a specific set of tasks that would likely limit overwork. Second, workers leveraged these quantified units to create flexibility in when specific work tasks were performed, allowing workers to limit overwork when facing fluctuating work demands. Third, workers promoted quantified units to clients as a standard measure of performance, establishing the completion of these units as a key criterion for work success. Particular substantiations of common characteristics of knowledge work—team autonomy, task expertise, and shared quality norms—are conditions for concerted quantification. Overall, we find that quantifying processes (a) help teams determine an appropriate amount of work to take on without engaging in overwork and (b) set clients’ expectations for the amount of work to be completed. We contribute to research on overwork and quantification by highlighting how quantification can, under certain conditions, support workers in limiting overwork.</content>

    <title>Working with the “Enemy”: Supervised Space, Free Space, and Cross-Border Collaboration amid Geopolitical Rivalry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As the world grapples with intensifying geopolitical competition and ideological conflict, many organizations face the daunting task of navigating the complexities of geopolitics and fostering effective cross-border partnerships. For members of these organizations, such political dynamics might create new barriers to their ability to carry out collaborative activities. In a historical case study of the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project—an unprecedented partnership between the space programs of the United States and the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War—we identify how organizational members navigated the turbulent geopolitical environment. We found that collaborative meetings between organizational members were limited to a supervised space that ensured government oversight but created interactional barriers. Organizational members realized that their ability to overcome these challenges would require them to develop practices outside of the organization, using boundary work to carve out free space outside the purview of political supervision. The free space served as a laboratory in which they reconciled informational, techno-cultural, and ideological differences and created solutions to the challenges they faced in the supervised space through translation work. Our study theorizes how geopolitics complicates the interactional processes of cross-border partnerships and underscores the importance of free space for fostering collaboration amid geopolitical rivalry.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2021.15574 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Accurate and equitable patient cost prediction is essential for informing health management policies and optimizing resource allocation, directly impacting government agencies, private insurers, and healthcare providers. This study highlights the importance of addressing disparities in prediction outcomes, particularly for high-need patients with complex chronic conditions, to ensure more effective economic and clinical decision making. By introducing a novel deep learning framework that segments administrative claims data into multiple channels, this research enhances both predictive accuracy and fairness, reducing overpayments and underpayments while mitigating bias in cost estimation. The findings underscore the potential of channel-wise modeling to support fair reimbursement structures, improve budget planning, and foster policies that better accommodate the diverse needs of patient populations. Policymakers and healthcare organizations can leverage these insights to design more efficient risk adjustment strategies, ensuring that vulnerable patients receive appropriate care without financial inefficiencies. The study provides a roadmap for integrating advanced machine learning approaches into healthcare decision making, promoting a more just and sustainable system.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper studies the application of first-order methods to the problem of computing equilibria of large-scale extensive-form games. It introduces a new weighted entropy-based distance-generating function for instantiating first-order methods. The new function achieves significantly better strong-convexity properties than existing weight schemes for the dilated entropy while maintaining the same easily implemented closed-form proximal mapping as the prior state of the art.The paper then generalizes our new entropy distance function, as well as the whole class of dilated distance functions, to the scaled extension operator. This yields the first efficiently computable distance-generating function for the decision polytopes capturing correlated and team solution concepts for extensive-form games. By instantiating first-order methods with these regularizers, several new results are achieved, such as the first method for computing ex ante correlated team equilibria with a guaranteed 1/T rate of convergence and efficient proximal updates.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Allocation with Costly Verification under AmbiguityIn “Distributionally Robust Optimal Allocation with Costly Verification,” Bayrak, Koçyiğit, Kuhn, and Pınar examine the mechanism design problem faced by a principal allocating a single good to one of several agents with costly verification and without monetary transfers, adopting a distributionally robust optimization perspective. Each agent desires the good and generates value for the principal, who does not initially know these values but can verify them at a cost. This problem arises in various scenarios, such as a venture capitalist selecting a start-up for funding or a procurement manager choosing a supplier. Many such allocation problems occur infrequently, leaving the principal with limited knowledge about the distribution of the agents’ values. The authors model these allocation problems as distributionally robust mechanism design problems, explicitly addressing distributional ambiguity. They introduce the first robustly (and Pareto-robustly) optimal mechanisms in the literature. These mechanisms are not only robust but also simple and interpretable.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The opaqueness of author naming and ordering, when coupled with power dynamics, can lead to a number of disadvantages in academic careers. In this commentary, we investigate gender differences in authorship experiences in a large prospective meta-analytic study (k = 46; n = 3,565; 12 countries). We find that women’s and men’s authorship experiences differ significantly with women reporting greater prevalence of problematic behaviors. We present seven actionable recommendations for improving the receipt and reporting of intellectual credit. Such actions are needed to ensure fairness in authorship, which is one of the most powerful factors in academics’ career outcomes.</content>

    <title>Physical Work Environments: An Integrative Review and Agenda for Future Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This review examines the effect of physical work environments—the dedicated, tangible spaces where employees carry out their professional tasks—on organizational processes and outcomes. We synthesize decades of research across various disciplines using a conceptual framework that defines physical work environments along three key dimensions: ambience, spatial configuration, and aesthetics. These dimensions are analyzed for their effects on both internal stakeholders, such as employees, and external stakeholders, including clients, suppliers, and investors. Our analysis reveals two major themes in prior research: (1) task accomplishment, which focuses on how physical work environments influence physical and mental health, motivation and attitudes, as well as work processes; and (2) resource position, which explores how these environments impact a firm’s tangible resource position, its ability to attract and retain human resources, as well as shape intangible assets such as organizational culture and reputation. The study also highlights contradictory findings and methodological limitations in existing research and proposes future research agendas. By providing theoretical insights and practical guidelines, this work seeks to guide both scholars and managers in understanding how physical workspaces can be designed to improve organizational outcomes, particularly as firms adapt to evolving work arrangements following the COVID-19 pandemic.</content>

    <title>“Complexity Is the Worst Enemy of Security”: Studying Cybersecurity Through the Lens Of Organizational Complexity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Writing about computer systems twenty-five years ago, Schneier wrote that “the worst enemy of security is complexity” (Schneier, 1999), because complex systems are both easier to attack and harder to secure than simpler ones. In this essay, we provide an overview of Schneier’s complexity principle and provide our observations of how two articles in this issue, Liang et al. (2025) and Tanriverdi et al. (2025), employed this principle in their research. We also offer our ideas for why complexity and cybersecurity are especially amenable for study in the field of information systems and where future research can go from here.</content>

    <title>The Critical Challenge of using Large-Scale Digital Experiment Platforms for Scientific Discovery</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;MIS Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Robust digital experimentation platforms have become increasingly pervasive at major technology and e-commerce firms worldwide. They allow product managers to use data-driven decision-making through online controlled experiments that estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) relative to a status quo control setting and make associated inferences. As demand for experiments continues to grow, orthogonal test planes (OTPs) have become the industry standard for managing the assignment of users to multiple concurrent experimental treatments in companies using large-scale digital experimentation platforms. In recent years, firms have begun to recognize that test planes might be confounding experimental results, but nevertheless, the practical benefits outweigh the costs. However, the uptick in practitioner-led digital experiments has coincided with an increase in academic-industry research partnerships, where large-scale digital experiments are being used to scientifically answer research questions, validate design choices, and/or derive computational social science-based empirical insights. In such contexts, confounding and biased estimation may have much more pronounced implications for the validity of scientific findings, contributions to theory, building a cumulative literature, and ultimately practice. The purpose of this Issues and Opinions article is to shed light on OTPs—in our experience, most researchers are unaware of how such test planes can lead to incorrect inferences. We used a case study conducted at a major e-commerce company to illustrate the extent to which interactions in concurrent experiments can bias ATEs, often making them appear more positive than they actually are. We discuss implications for research, including the distinction between practical industry experiments and academic research, methodological best practices for mitigating such concerns, and transparency and reproducibility considerations stemming from the complexity and opacity of large-scale experimentation platforms. More broadly, we worry that confounding in scientific research due to reliance on large-scale digital experiments meant to serve a different purpose is a microcosm of a larger epistemological confounding regarding what constitutes a contribution to scientific knowledge.</content>

    <title>How Competitive Is the Stock Market? Theory, Evidence from Portfolios, and Implications for the Rise of Passive Investing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The conventional wisdom in finance is that competition is fierce among investors: if a group changes its behavior, others adjust their strategies such that nothing happens to prices. We estimate a demand system with flexible strategic responses for institutional investors in the US stock market. When less aggressive traders surround an investor, she adjusts by trading more aggressively. However, this strategic reaction only counteracts two-thirds of the impact of the initial change in behavior. In light of these estimates, the rise in passive investing over the last 20 years has made the demand for individual stocks 11 percent more inelastic. (JEL G11, G14, G23, G41)</content>

    <title>Land Rental Markets: Experimental Evidence from Kenya</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do land market frictions cause misallocation in agriculture? In a field experiment in western Kenya, we randomly subsidize owners to rent out land. Induced rentals mostly persist after the subsidy ends and increase output and value added, consistent with misallocation. Gains from trade arise from renters choosing higher-value crops, having higher productivity, and adopting more nonlabor inputs, while renters use similar quantities of labor as owners. Induced rentals are not those with the largest predicted gains, underlining the importance of the joint distribution of gains and frictions, with frictions arising from search, risk, and learning.(JEL C93, O13, O18, Q12, Q15, Q24, R52)</content>

    <title>Do Ordeals Work for Selection Markets? Evidence from Health Insurance Auto-Enrollment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Are application hassles, or “ordeals,” an effective way to limit public program enrollment? We provide new evidence by studying (removal of) an auto-enrollment policy for health insurance, adding an extra step to enroll. This minor ordeal has a major impact, reducing enrollment by 33 percent and differentially excluding young, healthy, and economically disadvantaged people. Using a simple model, we show adverse selection—a classic feature of insurance markets—undermines ordeals’ standard rationale of excluding low-value individuals since they are also low-cost and may not be inefficient. Our analysis illustrates why ordeals targeting is unlikely to work well in selection markets. (JEL D82, G22, H75, I13, I18)</content>

    <title>The Decline of Too Big to Fail</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For globally systemically important banks (GSIBs) with US headquarters, we find significant reductions in market-implied probabilities of government bailout after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), along with roughly 170 percent higher wholesale debt financing costs for these banks after controlling for insolvency risk. Since the GFC, bank creditors appear to expect much larger losses in the event that a GSIB approaches insolvency. In this sense, we estimate a decline of “too big to fail.” (G01, G12, G21, G28, G33, H81)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We empirically characterize how China is internationalizing its bond market by staggering the entry of different types of foreign investors into its domestic market and propose a dynamic reputation model to explain this strategy. Our framework rationalizes China’s strategy as trying to build credibility as a safe issuer while reducing the cost of capital flight. We use our framework to shed light on China’s response to episodes of capital outflows. (JEL E44, F38, G12, G15, G23, O16, P34)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore the implications of ownership concentration for the recently concluded incentive auction that repurposed spectrum from broadcast TV to mobile broadband usage in the United States. We document significant multilicense ownership of TV stations. We show that in the reverse auction, in which TV stations bid to relinquish their licenses, multilicense owners have an incentive to withhold some TV stations to drive up prices for their remaining TV stations. Using a large-scale valuation and simulation exercise, we find that this strategic supply reduction increases payouts to TV stations by between 13.5 percent and 42.4 percent.

    <title>Mortgage Pricing and Monetary Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how central bank policies influence mortgage pricing in the United Kingdom. It shows that lenders price discriminate by offering two-part tariffs of interest rates and origination fees, and during unconventional monetary policies like the Funding for Lending Scheme, lenders reduced interest rates while increasing fees. Using a model of mortgage demand and lender competition, we find that central bank policies increased mortgage lending. Additionally, banning origination fees would reduce lending, as fees help lenders capture surplus while allowing them to price discriminate across borrowers with different sensitivities to rates and fees.

    <title>Corruption as a Local Advantage: Evidence from the Indigenization of Nigerian Oil</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Multinationals in the extractive sectors of weak states face resource theft by armed groups. Criminality is often abetted by state corruption, even though firms are willing to pay for protection. I study indigenization in Nigeria’s oil sector, which increased local firms’ participation substantially. Despite lower quality, local firms increase output by reducing oil theft. A bargaining model illustrates that political connections align law enforcement incentives, solving commitment problems. Data on law enforcement raids show that local firms receive preferential protection. Connections to military elites drive the local advantage. The aggregate gains from indigenization are at most between 2.3 and 5.7 percent of GDP. (JEL D73, F23, L71, O13, O17, Q34, Q35)</content>
