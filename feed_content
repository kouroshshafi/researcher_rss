    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Jointly Making Inventory Stocking and Assortment Offering DecisionsMaking the product assortment offer decisions for a customer requires keeping a balance between offering an assortment that will satisfy the current customer and reserving the products with scarce inventories for the customers who will arrive in the future. Therefore, whereas the assortment offer decisions should depend on the current inventories of the products, the stocking decisions should anticipate how the offered assortments will deplete the inventories, thereby creating a natural interaction between inventory stocking and assortment offer decisions. In “Coordinated Inventory Stocking and Assortment Customization,” Bai, El Housni, Rusmevichientong, and Topaloglu develop models that jointly make the assortment offer and inventory stocking decisions. Their models allocate the limited stocking capacity to the inventories for different products, while taking into consideration the assortment offer decisions that will be made for the customers arriving over a selling horizon.</content>

    <title>Deterministic Budget-Feasible Clock Auctions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the budget-feasible mechanism design problem, an auctioneer with a strict budget constraint is looking to acquire services from a set of self-interested providers. The auctioneer aims to design a polynomial-time strategy-proof mechanism that maximizes the value of the services she acquires, subject to the sum of payments to providers falling within her budget. This problem has attracted a great deal of attention due to its combination of practical relevance and theoretical depth. In “Deterministic Budget-Feasible Clock Auctions,” Balkanski, Garimidi, Gkatzelis, Schoepflin, and Tan provide the first such deterministic mechanism that achieves a constant-factor approximation for instances where the auctioneer’s valuation function is submodular. Moreover, this mechanism achieves an improved approximation even compared with previously known randomized mechanisms, and it takes the form of a clock auction, implying a suite of important properties that make this auction much more practical.</content>

    <title>Antisocial Responses to the “Coal to Gas” Regulation: An Unintended Consequence of a Residential Energy Policy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Policies geared toward environmental and economic improvement could unexpectedly lead to negative consequences in other dimensions. Such cases raise a red flag to economists and policymakers who aim to deliver comprehensive and sensible policy evaluations. This article investigates antisocial behaviors in response to the Clean Winter Heating Policy (CWHP), which seeks to improve outdoor air quality. Our results show that participating villagers are more likely to violate laws to burn agricultural waste and exhibit lower prosociality in incentivized dictator games and public goods games. We further explore treatment heterogeneities and find that two channels are likely to play a part. First, the CWHP was perceived as a negative income shock. Therefore, the villagers would want to reduce their expenditure on straw disposal and behave less generously in the incentivized games. Second, the CWHP could trigger discontent and directly affect social preference. Additional evidence suggests that the antisocial (less prosocial) responses could have been avoided by granting larger upfront subsidies.This paper was accepted by Axel Ockenfels, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: J.

    <title>Navigating market entry decisions in the solar &lt;scp&gt;PV&lt;/scp&gt; industry: The role of founders' pre‐entry experience across the value chain</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In emerging industries characterized by several technological generations giving rise to multiple submarkets that emerge at different points in time, start‐ups entering with novel technologies encounter markets at varying development stages and are confronted with the choice to enter either a nascent or an established market. We study the solar photovoltaic industry between 1985 and 2017 to examine how founders' pre‐entry experience along the industry value chain helps them navigate this complex decision. We find that founders with upstream industry experience possess operational acumen and manufacturing knowledge, prompting them to favor established markets. Conversely, founders with focal industry experience, guided by their unique insights into new applications and the limitations of existing technologies in fulfilling emerging customer needs, are more inclined to enter nascent markets.Managerial SummaryNew technologies often enable fulfillment of new user needs. In emerging industries witnessing successive waves of technologies, new markets materialize at different point in times. When firms enter these industries with fungible technologies, they can target markets in the early phases of formation or markets that are more mature and well developed. Evidence from the solar PV industry shows that the experience that entrepreneurs gained before founding their start‐up in this industry influences the choice of market: founders with prior experience developing solar technologies enter markets addressing new and undefined user needs while founders with prior experience in upstream industries that supply components to the solar industry gravitate toward mature markets, which place greater value on value efficiency enhancements.</content>

    <title>How shareholder litigation risk influences firm orientation toward stakeholders</title>
    <updated>2025-02-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines whether U.S. corporate executives would adopt a stronger stakeholder orientation if constraints imposed by shareholder litigation risk were relaxed. Leveraging the staggered adoption of Universal Demand (UD) laws across states as a quasi‐experimental setting, we test whether reduced litigation risk leads to managers prioritizing broader stakeholder initiatives. We find that firms increase stakeholder‐focused efforts following UD law adoption, with this shift more pronounced in firms with weaker shareholder governance provisions and lower levels of outside director ownership. Our study advances corporate governance and stakeholder theory by demonstrating how shareholder litigation risk acts as a governance mechanism that shapes managerial priorities. Additionally, we identify key boundary conditions moderating the relationship between governance constraints and stakeholder engagement.Managerial SummaryWhat happens when corporate executives feel less constrained by the risk of shareholder litigation? This study examines how reducing litigation risk leads to managers shifting their focus toward initiatives that benefit broader stakeholder groups, including employees, communities, and the environment. Using state‐level legal changes as a natural experiment, we find that firms adopt a more stakeholder‐oriented approach when shareholder litigation risk decreases—particularly in firms with weaker governance mechanisms tied to shareholder oversight. These findings highlight the critical role of legal frameworks and governance structures in shaping how executives balance shareholder and stakeholder priorities. For practitioners, this underscores the function of governance systems in influencing a firm's stakeholder strategy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the staggered introduction of a generative AI–based conversational assistant using data from 5,172 customer-support agents. Access to AI assistance increases worker productivity, as measured by issues resolved per hour, by 15% on average, with substantial heterogeneity across workers. The effects vary significantly across different agents. Less experienced and lower-skilled workers improve both the speed and quality of their output, while the most experienced and highest-skilled workers see small gains in speed and small declines in quality. We also find evidence that AI assistance facilitates worker learning and improves English fluency, particularly among international agents. While AI systems improve with more training data, we find that the gains from AI adoption are largest for moderately rare problems, where human agents have less baseline experience but the system still has adequate training data. Finally, we provide evidence that AI assistance improves the experience of work along several dimensions: customers are more polite and less likely to ask to speak to a manager.</content>

    <title>Auditing with a Chance of Whistleblowing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates the impact of promoting whistleblowing on audit quality and the efficiency of detecting misstatements. On the one hand, whistleblowing alerts the enforcer to the possibility of a misstatement and intensifies the regulatory effort, thereby incentivizing the auditor to improve audit quality. On the other hand, promoting whistleblowing reduces the enforcer’s investigative effort when there is no whistleblowing allegation, which in turn dampens the auditor’s incentive to enhance audit quality. We demonstrate that, under certain conditions, encouraging more whistleblowing can impair audit quality and reduce detection efficiency. We also examine the socially optimal whistleblowing program, and our analysis implies that the optimal whistleblowing intensity is increasing in investment cost and the quality of the whistleblower’s information.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: C.

    <title>The Effects of MiFID II on Voluntary Disclosure</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effect of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II’s controversial unbundling provision on corporate voluntary disclosure. Although prior research has largely focused on changes in sell-side research post-MiFID II, changes in voluntary disclosure and their effects on the information environment are less known. We find that European Union (EU) firms significantly increased the propensity and frequency of management earnings guidance issuance after MiFID II enactment. This effect is more pronounced among firms experiencing a decline in the quantity of sell-side research or a reduction in the consumption and dissemination of analyst reports and is more muted among firms witnessing improvements in research quality. Furthermore, we find that post-MiFID earnings guidance by EU firms becomes more thorough and elicits stronger market reactions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the increased guidance effectively alleviates the negative liquidity effects of MiFID II. Collectively, we contribute to the ongoing debate on the efficacy of MiFID II’s unbundling provision by providing evidence that voluntary disclosure plays a key role in mitigating the unintended net negative consequences on the information environment following the regulation.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: Financial support from the New York University Stern School of Business, Seoul National University, the Baruch College Zicklin School of Business, and George Washington University is gratefully acknowledged.

    <title>Consumption Solidarity: Healing Cultural Trauma Following Marketplace Violence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Targeted acts of violence in the marketplace disrupt the status quo and unravel the very fabric of community and consumption spaces. Despite the growing frequency of these shocking events, they remain underexplored in consumer research, particularly regarding their impact on consumer well-being and collective welfare. This research explores how individual reactions and choices in the face of incomprehensible violence can pave the way for consumer healing and collective regeneration through the re-establishment of community ties and marketplace exchanges. Our ethnographic inquiry ground these findings in the consumer response and solidarity that occurred in one community directly affected by the November 2015 Paris terrorist attacks. Our findings highlight how market spaces provide the scaffolding for communities to develop and foster interdependence through exchanges and shared moments. We also delineate cultural trauma as a subset of collective trauma. While both occur when a community one identifies with faces an existential threat, cultural trauma goes further by irrevocably altering the collective identity and transforming the community's members. Furthermore, we investigate cultural violence in a marketplace setting, when violent acts target culturally significant consumption practices and communal spaces.</content>

    <title>A Natural Disaster Reshapes Prosocial Microlending</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research SpotlightA natural disaster may result in a situation where lenders can hardly find appropriate loans from the disaster-affected region. When faced with the mismatch between the supply and demand of microloans, lenders can either simply choose not to make any contributions or divert their prosocial intentions towards a different group of beneficiaries. Using a natural experiment based on the Ebola outbreak in Africa in 2014, our research shows that a natural disaster increases (over the short-term) the average contribution size and decreases (over the long-term) the average fundraising time per dollar for prosocial microloans by borrowers from regions closer to the affected region. In contrast, a natural disaster decreases (over the long-term) the average contribution size and increases (over the long-term) the average fundraising time per dollar for prosocial microloans by borrowers from regions farther away from the affected region. This redistribution of prosocial microlending is an unintended consequence of a natural disaster that inflicts long-term economic hardship in some regions. Policymakers and researchers should closely monitor the redistribution of prosocial microlending resulting from a natural disaster so that prompt action can be taken to alleviate potential negative consequences that may arise.</content>

    <title>Team Makes You Better: Evidence from Online Medical Consultation Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractOur study of online medical consultation platforms shows that, when physicians work in virtual teams, they perform better even in their individual patient consultations. This improvement occurs primarily through peer effects: physicians are motivated to work harder when they can observe their teammates’ performance. The findings from our study offer valuable insights for the design and operation of online medical consultation (OMC) platforms. Specifically, whereas the rise of OMC platforms has significantly improved the connectivity among patients and physicians by reducing or even eliminating certain frictions in patient–physician encounters, there remain major challenges as to how to effectively match patients and physicians and facilitate value creation for both sides given the overall supply shortage of physicians. Our analysis indicates that team consultation may complement rather than cannibalize individual consultation. Whereas our research focuses on the healthcare sector, these insights apply broadly to other contexts (e.g., open-source software development and massive open online course platforms) in which professionals can form voluntary teams. The key is to carefully balance individual work with teamwork, providing the right tools and incentives for collaboration.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mimetic products like fake wood and fake meat pose a dilemma for producers. On the one hand, their core value lies in faithfully replicating a “real” referent. On the other hand, they must differentiate themselves. I explore this tension through a qualitative historical investigation of the first electronic musical organs: The Orgatron was a low‐cost close imitation of the pipe organ, whereas the Hammond was a lesser imitation that attempted to augment the pipe organ. Ironically, the Orgatron's superior imitation limited its success, whereas Hammond's lesser imitation enabled it to identify and develop new markets. My study suggests that the best product‐imitation strategy may not be faithful mimicry, but rather rapid augmentation. More generally, it contributes to the literatures on imitative products, positioning, and authenticity.Managerial SummaryMimetic products like fake wood and fake meat pose a dilemma for producers.

I explore this tension through a historical investigation of the first electronic musical organs.

    <title>Can Pollution Markets Work in Developing Countries? Experimental Evidence from India</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Market-based environmental regulations are seldom used in low-income countries, where pollution is highest but state capacity is often low. We collaborated with the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) to design and experimentally evaluate the world’s first particulate matter emissions market, which covered industrial plants in a large Indian city. There are three main findings. First, the market functioned well. Treatment plants, randomly assigned to the emissions market, traded permits to become significant net sellers or buyers. After trading, treatment plants held enough permits to cover their emissions 99% of the time, compared to just 66% compliance with standards under the command-and-control status quo. Second, treatment plants reduced pollution emissions, relative to control plants, by 20% to 30%. Third, the market reduced abatement costs by an estimated 11%, holding constant emissions. This cost-savings estimate is based on plant-specific marginal cost curves that we estimate from the universe of bids to buy and sell permits in the market. The combination of pollution reductions and low costs imply that the emissions market has mortality benefits that exceed its costs by at least twenty-five times.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How competition affects manipulation by firms of information about important attributes of their products and how such information manipulation impacts firms’ short-term and long-term performance are open empirical questions. We use a setting that is especially suitable for answering these questions—centralized crypto exchanges, on which information manipulation takes the form of inflated trading volume. We find that static and dynamic competition measures are positively associated with volume inflation, indicating that competition may lead to increased information manipulation. Exchanges that manipulate volume obtain short-run benefits but are punished in the long run, consistent with the trade-off between short-lived increases in rents and future losses because of damaged reputation.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: The authors thank the Israel Science Foundation [Grant 2225/21], the Coller School of Management Blockchain Research Institute, the Henry Crown Institute for Business Research in Israel, and the Cornell Fintech Initiative for financial support.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02903 .</content>

    <title>Do Institutional Investors Stabilize Equity Markets in Crisis Periods? Evidence from COVID-19</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;During the COVID-19 stock market crash, U.S. stocks with higher institutional ownership (IO) performed worse than those with lower IO. By studying firm-level changes, we identify two mechanisms behind this effect: a sudden downscaling of institutional capital in the equity market and a collective attempt by institutions to reposition their equity portfolios toward more COVID-resilient stocks. The stock price effects of their “portfolio downscaling” trades quickly reversed in the market’s recovery phase, whereas those of their “portfolio repositioning” trades lingered. The institutional rush for firm resilience also caused price pressures, with retail investors providing liquidity to stocks sold by institutional investors, both during the crisis and afterward.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Retargeted advertising that tries to entice potential customers back to a website is widely used by advertisers and has often replaced more traditional forms of targeting, such as contextual targeting that tries to match ads to website content. However, existing research has not investigated the extent to which these different targeting techniques compete with or complement each other. To investigate this, we conduct a large-scale field experiment with an automobile manufacturer to investigate how retargeting meshes with more traditional techniques of contextual targeting online and in turn how that should affect ad content. We investigate this using three different measures of online advertising effectiveness: website visits, engagement, and soft conversions. We find that combining contextual targeting and retargeting is more effective for all three measures. However, to unleash this effectiveness, marketers have to pay attention to the ad content in their retargeted ads. We find that when combining retargeted advertising with contextual targeting, ads that prompt users to customize an offering are the most effective. Last, we provide empirical evidence for understanding the underlying mechanism associated with our findings and replicate those findings with a laboratory experiment.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02310 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Producers’ resource allocation, performance, and survival depend on how market audiences identify, evaluate, and value them. While research has focused on producers’ heterogeneity, it has not consistently addressed audiences’ heterogeneity despite its critical consequences on producers’ decisions and market dynamics. This review integrates three research perspectives—ecological, socio-cognitive, and optimal distinctiveness—to offer a clearer comprehension of audience heterogeneity. It distinguishes between-audience heterogeneity from within-audience heterogeneity and regroups existing but scattered findings under two audience heterogeneity dimensions: audience plasticity and audience multiplexity. Avenues for research build on these distinctions and underscore the relationships between audience heterogeneity and market temporality, individual reactions (e.g., rooted in ideology and emotions), and technology (in particular AI-enhanced categorization).</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the arrival of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, intelligent machines are affecting the daily lives of multiple organizational stakeholders. However, despite the continued expansion of intelligent machines in society, management scholarship has generally lagged, and current frameworks are under-equipped to offer meaningful guidance regarding the intersection of intelligent machines and organizations. We address this issue via a multidisciplinary review and a novel framework of intelligent machines and value creation. First, we discuss the characteristics of intelligent machines (i.e., autonomy, learning, inscrutability, and materiality) and how variation in these characteristics impacts their affordances and, subsequently, the value offered to stakeholders. We also advance the notion of value contingencies, which captures the idea that the value afforded by intelligent machines is conditional and that stakeholders’ dispositions and exploitation of intelligent machines must be considered when assessing value creation. Building on our framework, we offer recommendations for future research. Overall, we forward the literature by showcasing how intelligent machines often create both advantages and disadvantages for stakeholders and demonstrate how practitioners, policymakers, and management scholars may consider this moving forward.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior scholarship characterizes awe as an aesthetic emotion, and the rich and growing aesthetics literature can help illuminate the role of awe in consumer psychology. The current commentary draws on this literature, as well as Keltner's conceptual analysis of awe, to highlight findings and remaining questions pertaining to awe in the realm of consumption. Marketing activities such as branding and promotion, store design, and product development present opportunities to awe consumers, yet awesome consumption experiences are rare. The current work discusses characteristics of awe‐inspiring products and brands, the tendency of awe to increase or decrease consumption, relevant individual differences between consumers, and the nature and evolutionary background of awe and aesthetics.</content>

    <title>Using Practice Employment Tests to Improve Diversity in Recruitment and Selection Through Equalizing Preparation Opportunities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human resources (HR) managers struggle to manage the adverse impact‐validity tradeoff where some of the most predictive and affordable hiring procedures, such as mental ability tests, often result in lower hiring rates for racioethnic minority subgroups of candidates, thus creating legal risks due to anti‐discrimination laws. In this study, we examine whether employer‐sponsored practice testing will reduce subgroup differences in test performance by offering an equalizing preparation opportunity framework based on the tenant ofaccess, including access to information and opportunities to perform. In a large diverse sample in an operational selection context (Npractice test= 29,626;Nactual test= 18,408;Nboth= 5078), we found that candidates who took the practice test scored higher on the actual tests than those who did not. All candidates benefitted by receiving an accurate estimate of passing the actual test and increasing their likelihood of applying. Further, racioethnic minorities realized greater score gains than racial non‐minorities, thereby reducing subgroup mean differences and subsequent adverse impact. The results were supportive for all major racioethnic minority subgroups (Asians, Blacks or African Americans, and Hispanics), and effect sizes were meaningfully large. Finally, we examined differences in other preparation tactics (e.g., gaining additional experience, using study guides) and found that racioethnic minorities were likely to use some tactics more than racioethnic non‐minorities, but not the most predictive tactics. We conclude that HR managers should consider equalizing preparation opportunities, specifically practice testing, to help address the adverse impact‐validity tradeoff by reducing impact without abandoning valid employment tests.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Inventory and Supply Chain Planning Systems as Drivers of Supply Chain Resilience: Analyses of Firm Performance through the Covid-19 Pandemic</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We combine insights from information processing theory (IPT), supply chain resilience literature, and collaboration with a leading supply chain planning technology provider to study the effects of excess inventory (a buffering tactic) and usage of supply chain planning systems (SCPS) (a bridging technology) on supply chain resilience. Utilizing the exogenous disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic as the setting for quasi-natural experiments, we compare profit impact and time-to-recover across manufacturing firms that operated with varied levels of inventory and SCPS use in the period leading up to the onset of the pandemic. The results of multiple tests provide no evidence that inventory buffering aided firms in being more resilient, even for firms in industries that experienced positive demand shocks in the pandemic. In contrast, we find that firms that used SCPS evidenced fewer negative financial impacts throughout the disruptive period, and they recovered faster than their peers. The results are robust to sample characteristics, time frame, and control-group matching procedures. Our study extends a growing literature on supply chain resilience by offering a more refined explanation of IPT in a disruptive context, highlighting the limitations of inventory as a buffering tactic, and describing how SCPS help planners cope with uncertainty and disruptions. In addition, interviews with managers from a leading SCPS provider and from user firms highlight specific ways in which SCPS provide faster and more effective responses to disruptions. We discuss the implications of these findings for future research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Utilizing the introduction of the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) as an exogenous shock to enhance secondary bond market transparency, we investigate the informational feedback effect of the bond market on supplier innovation in vertical relationships. We find that the increased availability of trading details regarding major customers’ outstanding bonds significantly fosters their supplier firms’ innovative investment. This positive effect of bond market transparency enhancements on supplier innovation is weakened when major customers demonstrate a better information environment, have higher levels of institutional ownership, and share common institutional investors with suppliers, while strengthened when the bond market conveys positive information about major customers, and when major customers face tighter financial constraints, exhibit higher levels of risk-taking, and possess greater importance to suppliers. Our findings clearly identify the informational role of the bond market in corporate investment decisions and specifically highlight the importance of bond market information regarding customer firms to the innovation along the supply chain.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Are All Generic Drugs Created Equal? An Empirical Analysis of Generic Drug Manufacturing Location and Serious Drug Adverse Events</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generic drugs provide lifesaving, affordable treatment to millions of people each day. Generic drug manufacturing has been steadily moving from advanced economies, such as the U.S., to emerging economies, such as India. Due to the opacity of drug supply chains, the quality risk implications of manufacturing in emerging economies has not been carefully empirically tested. This study addresses this gap. To do so, we identify a novel source of drug manufacturing location data which allows us to compare the occurrence of serious adverse events of generic drugs made in different locations. Using exact matching analyses based on the equivalency criteria established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), we find that generic drugs manufactured in India, where a majority of emerging economy generic drugs are made, are associated with significantly higher instances of serious adverse events than equivalent generic drugs made in the U.S., where a majority of advanced economy generic drugs are made. We further show that this key result is explained by mature generic drugs, which are particularly susceptible to operations and supply chain cost reduction efforts—efforts that unfortunately may compromise drug quality. Our study finding leads to implications for the FDA in their regulation of generic drugs.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Managing Reusable Resources with Usage Time Limits</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In reusable resources like vehicle sharing, city parking, and hotel services, resource units are used by consecutive customers for a stochastic usage time and are made available for future customers upon return. We model such reusable resources as Erlang loss systems, where customers who find all units occupied are blocked. Customers are rational decision-makers, and their willingness to join the system depends on factors such as price, time limits, service value, and resource availability. When each customer is charged a fixed price, we examine whether it is beneficial to install time limits, which increase availability at the expense of reduced usage time. We formulate and solve a two-dimensional revenue maximization problem to optimize both the usage price and the time limit. We differentiate between on-demand resources, which are immediately reusable upon return, and reserved resources, which can only be reused after the time limit expires. With on-demand resources, setting a time limit is proven to be detrimental, making the entry price the sole tool for maximizing revenue. This conclusion remains valid when the usage time increases with the entry price. In contrast, managing reserved resources involves an interplay between time limits and entry prices. Additionally, we show that loss systems (where customers do not wait) should be managed differently from systems where customers do wait. Specifically, in systems with waiting, we prove that only the time limit should be optimized, while the entry price should capture the full market share. We prove our results by analyzing the behavior of the equilibrium arrival rate and revenue, which necessitates establishing novel properties for the blocking probability. These properties yield new sharp bounds for the blocking probability and enable us to prove the convergence of the optimized model for on-demand resources to the QED regime as the number of resource units grows.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: When a Mighty Competitor Comes to Town, Can Adjusting Product Variety Shield Incumbent Stores from Sales Loss? Insights from Retail Collocation, Category, and Pre-Existing Competition</title>
    <updated>2025-02-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When a competitor enters a market, incumbent retail stores often adjust their product variety to maintain sales. However, no empirical evidence has been provided in the literature to justify the value of such product variety adjustments after a rival’s entry. One difficulty is that the change in consumer demand due to rival’s entry and changes in product variety simultaneously affect incumbents’ sales. When changes in sales at incumbent stores are observed after rivals’ entries, it is unclear whether the sales changes result from product variety adjustments or changes in consumer demand directly resulting from the entry. Even if adjusting product variety can potentially mitigate sales loss due to rivals’ entries, it is unclear whether such product variety adjustments provide a universal solution to all incumbent stores. This paper applies the difference-in-difference research design to develop a system of equations for product variety and sales at incumbent stores after rivals’ entries by exploiting the entries of warehouse clubs. The findings reveal that, on average, product variety at incumbent stores increased after the entries. This increased product variety mitigates the sales decreases caused by the entries with a diminishing return. After the entry of a warehouse club store, incumbent stores collocated with the new store have less sales loss than the non-collocated stores due to the trade-off between the substitution and agglomeration effects. Product variety adjustments at collocated incumbent stores experience greater sales benefits than non-collocated stores. Moreover, the sales loss that was mitigated by increased product variety at incumbent stores within the retail category of entrants is larger than others after the entry of a warehouse club store. Interestingly, the mitigation effect is not significant for certain incumbents, such as convenience and drug stores, which belong to different retail categories from entrants. This study also explores the heterogeneous effects by investigating pre-existing competition and different warehouse club chains. The empirical findings offer valuable insights to managers of incumbent stores on how to adjust product variety to reduce sales loss resulting from a rival’s entry.</content>

    <title>Making Delivery Platform Drivers Safer: Platform Responsibility Versus Consumer Empowerment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The increasing frequency of traffic accidents involving food delivery drivers has raised public concern about the safety of fast delivery services. In response, food delivery platforms have introduced two corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategies to enhance drivers’ road safety: One in which the platform assumes full responsibility for extending delivery times and another that empowers consumers to decide on extended delivery times. Additionally, policymakers are mandating that platforms purchase employment injury insurance for their drivers. Despite these efforts, debates continue over how platforms should adjust delivery times to mitigate driver risk and whether new driver protection policies are truly effective. In this study, we employ the Hotelling model to examine a duopoly food delivery market in which consumers are socially responsible, time-sensitive, and exhibit heterogeneous loyalty to competing platforms. Building on the consumer empowerment framework, we investigate the optimal CSR strategy choices for these platforms and assess the resulting impacts on various stakeholders. Our analysis provides three key insights. First, we demonstrate that offering differentiated extended delivery time options can mitigate the negative impact of consumer aversion to empowerment on platform profitability, especially in markets with a significant consumer heterogeneity in time sensitivity. Second, we identify a potential all-win CSR outcome, wherein positively shaping consumer attitudes benefits all stakeholders, a possibility often overlooked in practice. Third, we surprisingly find that the widely adopted protective measure, namely the mandatory insurance policy (MIP), does not effectively mitigate driver risk. In contrast, our proposed risk-based MIP addresses this limitation and allows consumers who actively participate in CSR initiatives to benefit from a lower markup on delivery fees. These insights offer a refined analytical framework for understanding consumer empowerment, providing valuable guidance for researchers, platform operations managers, and policymakers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Reverse factoring (RF) is a highly relevant form of supply chain finance. Whereas extant analytical studies indicate how RF should enable buyers to extend payment terms, sufficient empirical evidence is lacking. To hypothesize on payment term extensions, we study three motives—financing cost, fairness, and standardization. Our empirical evidence indicates the presence of all three. It extends former analytical work on RF adoption revolving around sthe financing cost motive only.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The proliferation of fake news, more recently multimodal fake news, poses a significant threat to individuals, organizations, and society. While online social media platforms have employed automated methods to combat fake news, they face two notable challenges: the scarcity of labeled data and the diversity of news domains. To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of online platforms in mitigating the spread of fake news, this study proposes MT-GPD (Multimodal Deep Transfer learning with Gating network, model Patch, and Domain classifier) for cross-domain fake news detection. MT-GPD integrates three novel design artifacts as auxiliary mechanisms for enhancing multimodal deep transfer learning, including a gating network that captures the relative importance of textual and visual components of individual news articles for dynamic fusion; a customized model patch that balances detection performance and computational efficiency; and a domain classifier that adapts multimodal representations to a target news domain. We evaluate the performance of MT-GPD using news datasets spanning four different domains. The results demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of MT-GPD, providing strong evidence for the impacts of the proposed auxiliary mechanisms on improving fake news detection performance.</content>

    <title>When Lives Are at Stake: Managing Temporal Complexity with a Strategy Process Repertoire</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Humanitarian organizations assisting victims of armed conflict face fragmented and potentially conflicting temporal demands on strategy making. Annual donor funding requires detailed planning, unpredictable outbreaks of war and violence demand quick and flexible decisions, and long-term societal challenges must be addressed over the next decades. Few studies have examined how organizations can achieve temporal fit in such temporally complex environments without accepting internal fragmentation or decoupling from certain temporal demands. We draw on a longitudinal case study of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), a humanitarian organization with the mandate to aid victims of armed conflict, to explore this gap. We find that the ICRC has developed a repertoire of multiple distinct strategy processes tailored to the fragmented temporal demands. These processes include emergency responses, strategic planning, and long-term strategizing. Although each strategy process retained its distinctiveness, their loose coupling ensured a sufficient alignment of resource allocation in pursuit of the organization’s humanitarian mandate. Strong shared principles and an episodic activation of strategy processes helped to manage the inherent complexity of loose coupling. Thus, strategy process repertoires may form a capability supporting strategic decision making in temporally complex environments. Our study contributes to strategy process research by introducing loose coupling as a mechanism for integrating multiple strategy processes with different temporalities, complementing previous studies on strategy processes as a tightly coupled structural context. Furthermore, we advance theorizing on ambitemporality by analyzing how the loose coupling of internal temporal structures may help organizations cope with temporal complexity.</content>

    <title>Let Us Not Speak of Them, but Look and Pass? Organizational Responses to Online Reviews</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a world where five stars have become the standard for evaluating many transactions, and consumers turn to the crowd for guidance when making a wide variety of choices, organizations cannot dismiss online reviews as inconsequential. And while we know a lot about how organizations respond to reviews online, there has been a lack of systematic evidence showing how organizations behave in response to online feedback once their screens are turned off. This paper leverages a novel combination of insights from a lab-in-the-field experiment, an archival study, and two rounds of qualitative interviews in the French restaurant industry to examine online and offline responses to reviewer feedback. We identify characteristics of the review, the restaurant, and the respondent that influenced when restaurants in our sample were more likely to align their actions online and offline, and when they were more likely to decouple them—i.e., posting an online response promising to take corrective action while having no intention to change how the restaurant operates “in real life”. We conclude by speculating on potential mechanisms behind our respondents’ reactions, and discussing our contribution to literature on producer reactivity and the symbolic management of change.</content>

    <title>On Resource Complementarity Among Startups, Accelerators, and Financial Investors: a Large-scale Analysis of Sorting and Value Creation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a theoretical framework and provide empirical evidence on how resource complementarity or substitutability between entrepreneurs and seed investors drives selection and value creation in the context of high-tech startups. Specifically, we argue that seed investors specialized in training programs - startup accelerators - are the ideal match for entrepreneurial teams equipped with strong technological competencies but lacking business knowledge. On the other hand, when entrepreneurs with extensive business knowledge pair up with accelerators, the value created is typically less. Combining information from Crunchbase and LinkedIn, we provide robust empirical evidence based on the assortative matching of startups and investors and the ex-post analysis of joint value creation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The recently introduced and highly practical class of deferred acceptance clock auctions offers a unique combination of desirable properties, including obvious strategy-proofness, unconditional winner privacy, and transparency. Early excitement around these auctions was dampened due to a result demonstrating that no deterministic and prior-free clock auction can guarantee better than a logarithmic approximation of the optimal social welfare, even in simple settings. In “Bayesian and Randomized Clock Auctions,” Feldman, Gkatzelis, Gravin, and Schoepflin reignite this excitement by demonstrating that one can achieve improved results for a wide class of instances if a clock auction can either use randomization or has access to prior information. The authors provide three different clock auctions that achieve these improved guarantees given access to different amounts of prior information, exhibiting how additional information can further simplify the auction design.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a measure of the speed of firm-level information diffusion, study how it is affected by limited attention, and examine its effect on real corporate decisions. Using local flu epidemics as exogenous attention shocks, we show that inattention from dual-covering analysts and cross-holding institutions reduces the speed of information diffusion from customer to supplier stock prices. We find that the speed of information diffusion along the supply chain affects the price feedback effect for corporate investment decisions and facilitates coordination between customers and suppliers. Our findings demonstrate that coattention from key market participants affects information efficiency and generates real economic outcomes.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Funding: L.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prosocial behavior research has historically considered altruistic or self-interested motives as the primary drivers for charitable giving. Recently, however, there have been many high-profile cases wherein consumers use their donations to harm others. We define this behavior, characterized by a desire for retribution resulting from witnessing or experiencing volitional wrongdoing, as “retributive philanthropy” and examine this phenomenon using a multi-method approach. Qualitative interviews with perpetrators and targets of retributive philanthropy reveal key themes of blameworthiness judgments, strong negative affect, and a desire to harm as a terminal goal of donation—all of which are not typically associated with prosocial behaviors. Analysis of real-world anti-vaccine protestor donation data find similar themes of perceived wrongdoing and outrage related to retributive donations in a large-scale context. Five lab studies and five supplementary studies then demonstrate the effects of perceived volitional wrongdoing, harm, efficacy, and authoritarianism on willingness to make retributive donations. Together, these findings offer critical insight into an emerging mode of donation that is emotionally, motivationally, and behaviorally distinct from traditional prosocial behavior and has important implications for consumers and charitable marketers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Effect of Gender-Neutral Marketing on Consumer Attribute Preference</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As consumer demand for gender inclusivity grows, numerous brands are actively embracing gender-neutral communication and practices to signal their commitment to inclusivity. While companies generally assume gender-neutral marketing (i.e., efforts that explicitly reject binary gender categorization and stereotypes) nets favorable benefits, this research uncovers an unintended consequence of this marketing practice on consumer attribute preference. Specifically, the authors find that gender-neutral marketing decreases consumers’ reliance on aesthetics in product evaluations by reducing their endorsement of binary gender stereotypes in their decision making. Eight pre-registered studies—including field experiments, an eye-tracking study, and lab and online experiments—provide triangulating evidence for these propositions. The authors also identify three boundary conditions by revealing that the effect is less pronounced when the brand exhibits a prominent binary gender personality, among consumers who primarily rely on visual elements in their information processing, and when the target product is expected to be used in a social context. These findings deepen our understanding of how Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in marketing shape consumer behavior and provide valuable insights for managers seeking to implement gender-neutral marketing tactics.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: To Acquire or to Ally? the Impact of Strategic Emphasis on Governance Mode Choice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In pursuit of growth, firms often rely on outside options and choose a specific governance mode (acquisitions or alliances) to manage their external partnerships. In such pursuits, a firm’s strategic emphasis, i.e., relative focus on value appropriation vs. value creation, could be crucial in determining appropriate governance mode choice. In this paper, the authors draw on transaction cost economics and the resource-based view to articulate and empirically assess the impact of strategic emphasis on governance mode choice using a large panel of publicly listed US firms. They also identify and test two boundary conditions, namely CMO presence and analyst coverage of the firm. The results indicate that firms with a greater strategic emphasis on value appropriation relative to value creation are more likely to prefer acquisitions over alliances. Further, the positive impact of strategic emphasis on the likelihood of choosing acquisitions over alliances is weakened both with CMO presence and with increasing analyst coverage of the firm. These results provide insights on how a firm’s strategic emphasis might impact its choice of governance mode, in the presence of CMO and analyst coverage.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how different stakeholders perceive influencer authenticity, revealing the misalignments that arise when each group prioritizes different aspects of authenticity. In doing so, the authors generate new theory on influencer marketing and provide managerial insights for brands and agencies to collaborate effectively with influencers to resolve these misalignments and ultimately build and sustain influencer authenticity. Using exploratory, in-depth interviews with consumers, influencers, brand managers, and influencer marketing agencies, the study triangulates stakeholder perspectives on influencer authenticity. Specifically, it examines the misalignment among these groups through the lens of assemblage theory and explores how these misalignments may be resolved to produce successful and lasting influencer assemblages. Finally, it explores how influencer marketing agencies can help manage authenticity misalignments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many business-to-business sales firms use automated lead nurturing (ALN) systems, which track leads’ online behavior and nurture them through personalized content. ALN software providers claim that ALN improves lead conversion, but whether this benefit materializes is unclear. Therefore, this research examines ALN’s effect across one qualitative and three quantitative studies. The findings indicate that ALN can provide valuable information to both sellers and leads and thereby improve the quality of salesperson–lead interactions, which in turn drives lead conversion. On average, ALN increases the probability of lead conversion between 0 (Studies 1, 3) and 23 (Study 2) percentage points. However, these effects strongly depend on a lead’s sales cycle length, expected sales volume, and preexisting relationship with the seller. Thereby, this article conducts the first rigorous “fact check” of ALN and provides evidence that understanding the effect of ALN requires a contingency view. The findings also call on practitioners to change their current practices related to ALN. Rather than accepting industry claims at face value, practitioners should verify whether ALN improves lead conversion in their specific context. Furthermore, they should employ ALN particularly for leads where information asymmetry persists and is unlikely to be resolved through other, more costly means.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Effect of Company Size on Aggregate Word of Mouth Valence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online word of mouth (WOM) is a critical driver of consumer purchases; however, relatively few researchers have sought to understand how a company’s characteristics might impact aggregate WOM valence (e.g., average star ratings of online reviews). The authors examine the effects of one such attribute—company size—and how it impacts WOM valence through individuals’ decisions regarding whether to engage in WOM. In four field studies, the authors find a negative relationship between company size and WOM that persists when controlling for the quality of consumers’ experience with the company. Subsequent experiments show that this effect occurs because consumers are more empathetic toward smaller companies. This empathy increases their desire to help smaller companies, which in turn increases the likelihood that they share WOM about a smaller company following a high-quality experience and decreases this likelihood in the case of a low-quality experience. Larger companies can mitigate the negative effect on aggregate WOM valence by responding frequently to WOM posts and employing language that evokes empathy—for example, by using emotional words, providing personalized responses, and addressing consumers by name.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Displaying the Amount of Consumption Time in Online Reviews Can Affect Helpful Votes</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Some review platforms display how long reviewers used a product alongside their review. The authors investigate whether doing so translates to more helpful reviews. Using online reviews of video games from a video game platform and leveraging its unique playtime tracking feature, they find the relationship between the amount of time playing a game before posting a review and the number of helpful votes the review receives follows a u-shape, where shorter and longer playtimes correspond to more votes, while intermediate times correspond to fewer votes. How displayed consumption time affects consumer expectations potentially explains this relationship. The less time reviewers spend consuming a product, the lower others’ expectations of review helpfulness may be and hence the more lenient their judgements. More consumption time may increase these expectations, but extensive consumption time could overcome this higher bar by signaling credibility. Moderation results related to reviewer experience signaling and review or product characteristics, as well as mediation results involving consumer-gifted review awards help support this context-based expectations account. These results are robust to conditioning out review, reviewer, and game level factors, sample matching, and other settings. The findings have implications for reducing the asymmetric information problem, managing expectations, and optimizing reviews.</content>

    <title>Theorizing Waste as a Technique of Power in Capitalistic Stakeholder Relations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Waste is an important socio‐ecological challenge of contemporary capitalism, contributing to climate change and environmental degradation. Despite its pervasiveness and its impacts on diverse stakeholders, it yet remains largely underexplored in management and organization studies. Addressing this gap, this paper investigates waste's crucial role in shaping specific stakeholder relations by theorizing it as a technique of power. By examining the case of a socio‐ecological crisis in Naples, Italy, characterized by illegal waste practices linked to Mafia organizations, we unpack two entangled techniques of power:commodifying waste– transforming it into something that can be traded on a market and perpetuating its exploitation; andignoring waste– involving failing or refusing to consider and recognize waste. Our findings elucidate how these two techniques produced and reinforced socio‐ecological hierarchies, in which local stakeholders were wasted. By highlighting the lived experiences of local communities affected by waste, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of power dynamics among diverse stakeholders in socio‐ecological crises and demonstrates how waste functions as a mechanism of dispossession within capitalist accumulation.</content>

    <title>Are Family Owners Willing to Risk “Rocking the Boat”? A Blended Socioemotional Wealth-Implicit Theory Framework</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage research on socioemotional wealth (SEW) and implicit theories to develop a novel blended SEW-implicit theory framework that explains why some family firms are more risk seeking or more risk averse. According to implicit theory, individuals perceive reality through their interpretative cognitive filters. Those with an entity theory orientation see reality as relatively fixed or uncontrollable, while those with an incremental-implicit theory orientation tend to perceive reality as malleable and change as leading to positive outcomes. We theorize that family firms with high SEW intensity tend to adopt an entity orientation, whereas those with low SEW intensity tend to adopt an incremental orientation. Accordingly, we propose that the likelihood that family owners hold either orientation is shaped by organizational features associated with SEW intensity, namely (a) the salience of family versus business identity, (b) family founder imprinting, (c) generational stage, and (d) favorable path dependence. In turn, family owners with an entity orientation are less likely to take risks compared to family owners with an incremental orientation. Furthermore, we theorize that a firm’s performance hazard can shift family owners’ implicit orientation from entity-based to incremental and vice versa, thereby impacting their risk-taking behavior.</content>

    <title>Gains from Product Variety: Evidence from a Large Digital Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digital platforms can increase product variety and consumer choice by facilitating the discovery and availability of new products. In this paper, we document the massive growth of new products on the largest digital platform in China and quantify the welfare implications for consumers. Using sales data on three categories of books from 2015 and 2019, we find that the number of product titles almost doubles, whereas prices fall somewhat. Most of the new products are niche offerings that exhibit less elastic demand. Accounting for the niche nature of new products generates welfare gains 40 times larger than those from lower prices and 30% higher than existing estimates that do not distinguish between mass and niche products. We also examine the geographic variation in these gains and find that consumers in rural and low-income regions enjoy greater benefits from increased variety. The findings emphasize that expanding niche product offerings may outperform price reductions in generating consumer benefits. Policymakers are encouraged to support e-commerce development in underserved regions to harness the inclusive growth enabled by digital platforms.</content>

    <title>Tech‐Enabled Inclusion: Leveraging Social Media to Empower Neurodivergent Employees in the Workplace</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Neurodivergent employees (NDEs) are characterized by different neurological profiles, including but not limited to autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Tourette syndrome, face underrepresentation, and undervaluation at work. This review employs the technology affordance lens and a diversity and inclusion model to explore how social media (SM) can facilitate the inclusion of NDEs. We propose a technology‐inclusion framework as a foundation for future model testing by delineating the key variables and relationships at play. A narrative review is adopted to discuss our findings derived from a comprehensive search of relevant literature, which yielded 41 journal articles and five book chapters. We employed thematic analysis, facilitated by ATLAS.ti's artificial intelligence coding function, to critically review and analyze the shortlisted articles through a rigorous, iterative process. Our framework highlights three pathways (NDE‐related, leader‐related, and peer‐related) that discuss the combination of SM affordances enhancing and inhibiting the inclusion of NDEs. In particular, SM affordances can build inclusion by enhancing self‐efficacy and a sense of empowerment, facilitating accessible communication, and connection. However, privacy and personal safety concerns explain why SM affordances sometimes undermine inclusion. Likewise, pathways related to supervisory support, and increased interactions and support from peers highlight the role of leaders and peers in translating SM affordances to NDEs' inclusion. We emphasize that leveraging SM applications, understanding NDEs' specific needs, and fostering an inclusive culture starting from organizational leadership can significantly contribute to promoting inclusion and support for NDEs in the workplace.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Configurational research has great promise in entrepreneurship. There are few universal laws or relationships that hold under all circumstances. More often, optimal entrepreneurial outcomes are contingent on many factors. Consequently, configurational analysis using qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) has become increasingly popular. However, methodological research in sociology and political science has raised concerns about possible false positive findings produced by this method. In this editorial, we explore the potential and the common pitfalls of QCA in entrepreneurship research, as well as guidelines for its use.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research suggests that employees benefit from highly passionate teammates because passion spreads easily from one employee to the next. We develop theory to propose that life in high-passion teams may not be as uniformly advantageous as previously assumed. We suggest that high-passion teams also evoke pressures that lead employees to expend effort to increase their levels of passion, which negates the benefits the team provides. We first conducted an experience-sampling study at an engineering company involved in the production and maintenance of critical infrastructure that benefits the greater good, with 829 employees nested in 155 teams, which we surveyed three times per day for 20 consecutive work days. These data show that employees caught their teammates’ passion and consequently reported better performance, lower emotional exhaustion, and a stronger sense of social connection. However, these benefits coexisted alongside costs employees incurred that were associated with increasing their passion. In a subsequent pre-registered experiment ( N = 1,063), we provide causal evidence for these effects and their underlying mechanism, finding that passion contagion is particularly effort-laden—more so than contagion of other states and increases in passion that are not the result of contagion. We develop a theory of differentiated passion contagion that exposes the effort inherent in contagion and the implications of that effort. Our work suggests that passion caught from others may hold less value than passion incited from within, and shifts our understanding of when and why passion for work is beneficial and detrimental. We also discuss implications for broader emotional contagion theory.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates how competition for scarce corporate resources impacts innovation incentives within multidivisional firms and, consequently, shapes firms’ preferences for fostering or restricting intra-firm competition. In our model, divisions become privately informed about the potential value of new investment opportunities generated through their innovation initiatives. We demonstrate that intra-firm competition unambiguously reduces divisions’ex anteinnovation incentives. However, it benefits ex post resource allocation by enabling the firm to (i) select the most promising project and (ii) limit the rents divisions earn from their private information. Consequently, a firm’s preference to limit or encourage interdivisional competition hinges on balancingex postallocative efficiency, which favors increased intra-firm competition, againstex anteinnovation incentives, which favor reduced competition. Our analysis identifies plausible conditions under which each organizational design—competitive or exclusive innovation—emerges as the optimal choice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a measure of local long-run growth prospects, I uncover a novel link between economic fundamentals and house prices. Whereas excess housing returns are positively associated with economic growth prospects, housing valuations are negatively associated with shocks to growth prospects. I document an explanation in metro-area consumption: housing consumption is asymmetrically exposed to economic prospects in that it expands more quickly when prospects are strong than it contracts when prospects are poor. I explain these findings through the lens of an asset pricing model that focuses on a trade-off between nonseparable committed housing and nonhousing consumption.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: Data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01996 .</content>

    <title>Upward Influencers in Teams</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Upward influencers, employees who are more favorably perceived by their supervisors than their peers and subordinates, are predicted by economic and accounting theories and are found to be ubiquitous in many organizations. Despite their prevalence, the role of upward influencers in teams remains underexplored. This paper fills this void by using proprietary data from a service‐providing organization that allows for the identification of upward influencers based on its 360‐degree person evaluation. We find an inverted U‐shaped relationship between the fraction of upward influencers in a team and team performance. In cross‐sectional analyses, we show that this relationship is driven by conditions when the need for collaboration and information sharing is high and when managers are less experienced. Additional tests exploring the mechanisms for the role of upward influencers in teams suggest that they impair team horizontal relationships through lowering the willingness to communicate, share knowledge, and offer mutual assistance among team members. Yet, teams with upward influencers build better vertical relationships with supervisors, which, in return, is associated with supervisors allocating more of their time to provide team members with feedback and guidance. Taken together, this study contributes to the understanding of upward influencers in teams.</content>

    <title>Do Reductions in Search Costs for Partial Information on Online Platforms Lead to Better Consumer Decisions? Evidence of Cognitive Miser Behavior from a Natural Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online platforms increasingly utilize technologies like artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered tools to reduce consumers’ search costs and simplify decision making. However, these tools often target specific types of information, leading to what we term "search cost reduction for partial information." Although designed to assist consumers, our study highlights their unintended consequence: these tools can induce "cognitive miser" behavior, where consumers focus on easily accessible information while neglecting other critical details. This behavior can ultimately result in poorer decision making. Using a natural experiment on Yelp, we evaluated the impact of its AI-powered image categorization feature, introduced in 2015 to reduce the search costs of review images. Through a difference-in-differences design and text analysis of consumer complaints, we found that this feature negatively affected decision quality. These findings carry important implications for platform managers and policymakers. Although search cost reduction tools can improve efficiency, they also risk biasing consumer attention toward easily accessible information at the expense of holistic decision making. Online platforms could mitigate these effects by complementing AI-empowered search cost reduction features with tools that emphasize information requiring greater cognitive effort, thereby ensuring balanced consumer awareness. We recommend that platform designers carefully evaluate the broader impacts of such tools to better support consumer decision making.</content>

    <title>Born to behave: Home CEOs and financial misconduct*</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the association between CEO birthplace proximity and financial misconduct. We find that CEOs managing firms near their birthplaces (home CEOs) are associated with less financial misconduct compared to other CEOs. This association is not attributable to differences in corporate governance. The relationship strengthens in areas with a strong local investment presence and greater religious commitment as well as among CEOs with longer tenures in their home state. Our findings are robust to addressing potential selection and omitted variable biases as well as to conducting multiple robustness tests, including analyses of involuntary CEO changes and headquarters relocations. We also find a similar association for CFOs, with firms employing home CFOs exhibiting less financial misconduct.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Technological developments – particularly related to artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and digitalization – are disrupting the workplace in unprecedented ways, particularly in professional and knowledge‐intensive sectors. Scholars' views on the implications of these disruptions range from optimism and pessimism to scepticism. Disciplines vary in how extensively they have considered the implications of these technological developments. With much prior work focusing on the more macro‐level phenomena and effects, the role of institutions, organizations and individuals – as well as their interrelatedness – remains less examined. In this introductory article to the special issue, we discuss the scope, extent and new domains of change related to the Future of Work and, especially, to AI. We also reflect on the consequences of these changes as well as the related processes and mechanisms through which they will manifest. Then, we introduce and summarize the articles included in this special issue along the above dimensions. We conclude by reflecting on the overall contribution of the special issue and on future directions for examining the Future of Work from the perspective of management studies.</content>

    <title>Plain Sailing or Choppy Water? Maintaining Interpersonal Trusting Relationships in Times of Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Interpersonal trusting relationships frequently experience relational threats that require both parties to engage actively in trust maintenance efforts. Yet, trust research has tended to focus on trust formation, or trust repair in the case of a violation, and offers us little insight regarding how these more ambiguous threats to trusting relationships are experienced and overcome relationally. To provide novel insight on this topic, this exploratory study gathers dyadic interview data from 26 manager–employee trusting relationships regarding their experience of relational threats and their proactive efforts to overcome these negative relational experiences. Findings show that the experience of a relational threat triggers a three-stage trust maintenance process that includes an assessment phase, an active maintenance phase, and an outcome phase. Threats are assessed at the individual level via cognitive and affective sensemaking, while trust maintenance efforts (creating a shared mental model, cognitive and structural reassurance, and dyadic problem solving) require dyadic counterparts to act with mutual agency to overcome the relational threat and avoid a loss of trust. Trust maintenance processes support dyads to either maintain or strengthen their existing trusting relationships. Our findings advance our theoretical understanding of interpersonal trust maintenance by demonstrating that this process unfolds across three phases and can lead to different outcomes for dyads’ trusting relationships. We offer practical guidelines to safeguard existing trusting relationships, as well as a new agenda for trust scholars to extend our theorizing.</content>
