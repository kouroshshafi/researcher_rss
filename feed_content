    <title>In This Apportionment Lottery, the House Always Wins</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Randomized Apportionment: A Fairer Distribution of SeatsThe question of how to apportion the seats of the U.S. House of Representatives to states has fueled century-long political debates and sparked mathematical theory. Traditional deterministic methods, such as the Hamilton method or the currently used Huntington–Hill method, may result in paradoxes or substantially deviate from proportionality. In their paper “In This Apportionment Lottery, the House Always Wins,” Gölz, Peters, and Procaccia propose a randomized approach that ensures each state receives its exact proportional share of seats in expectation and its proportional share, up to rounding, ex post. By incorporating randomization, the authors argue, the system can better adhere to the principle of proportional representation, minimizing the impact of small counting errors and ensuring fairness over time. In addition, their approach achieves house monotonicity, a property that prevents counterintuitive outcomes when the total number of seats changes. This is achieved through a novel cumulative rounding technique, a generalization of dependent rounding on bipartite graphs with potential applications beyond apportionment, including EU commission nominations and resource allocation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Industrial policies are widely used across the world. In practice, designing and implementing these policies is a complicated task. In this paper, we assess the long-term performance of different industrial policy instruments, which include production subsidies, investment subsidies, entry subsidies, and consolidation policies. To do so, we examine a recent industrial policy in China aiming to propel the country’s shipbuilding industry to the largest globally. Using firm-level data from 1998 to 2014 and a dynamic model of firm entry, exit, investment, and production, we find that (i) the policy boosted China’s domestic investment, entry, and international market share dramatically, but delivered low returns and led to fragmentation, idle capacity, as well as depressed world ship prices; (ii) the effectiveness of different policy instruments is mixed: production and investment subsidies can be justified by market share considerations, while entry subsidies are wasteful; (iii) counter-cyclical policies, firm-targeting, and shortening the intervention horizon can substantially reduce distortions. Our results highlight the critical role of firm heterogeneity, business cycles, and firms’ cost structure in policy design. Finally, when exploring potential rationales, we find support for nonclassical considerations, such as reducing freight rates to boost Chinese trade.</content>

    <title>Reactions, Revisions, and Rehiring: Changes in Employers’ Gendered Preferences in Online Labor Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employers in online labor marketplaces prefer women over men because of stereotypes that women are more trustworthy. These stereotypes are especially salient in this context because of the uncertainty in online transactions. Yet, employers’ interactions with women and men workers might moderate the influence of trustworthiness stereotypes and, by extension, employers’ hiring preferences for individual women and men as well as gender categories in general. By exploiting rare access to large-scale, longitudinal hiring data from an online labor marketplace, we examine how employers’ interactions with workers shape their subsequent hiring preferences. Using linear probability models with job fixed effects, we find that employers prefer rehiring workers with whom they previously had positive interactions over unknown workers. Men workers benefit more than women workers from positive interactions, suggesting that these interactions decrease the influence of negative stereotypes about men’s trustworthiness. We additionally find that employers prefer hiring workers of the same gender as workers with whom they previously had positive interactions, suggesting that employers’ interactions with individual women and men shape their preferences for hiring women and men in general. These findings point to a nuanced theoretical relationship between employers’ interactions with workers and their social category preferences in hiring under conditions of immense uncertainty.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17383 .</content>

    <title>Encounter Decisions for Patients With Diverse Sociodemographic Characteristics: Predictive Analytics of EMR Data From a Large Chain of Clinics</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managing chronic diabetes care is a major challenge faced by healthcare organizations because it requires resource commitment over a long duration, high levels of patient engagement in the care process, and the socioeconomic and racial diversity of the patient population significantly affect care outcomes. Therefore, it is important to personalize chronic care treatment to improve chronic care outcomes. We propose a decision framework for the predictive management of diabetes that can help reduce the population‐level risk of diabetes. We use machine learning on clinical measures, demographics, and socioeconomic status of a large patient population from a chain of clinics in the Midwestern United States to predict the future health conditions of individual diabetes patients. Furthermore, we use the predictive analytic model outcome to build a decision analytic framework to optimally allocate encounters to individual patients. Also, we propose a heuristic solution to the optimal resource allocation model for implementation purposes. We make theoretical and methodological contributions by identifying and combining clinical, demographic, and socioeconomic factors to predict future diabetes risk for patients and demonstrate the use of the predicted risks for optimal resource utilization. Another significant contribution is demonstrating that a data‐driven predictive encounter allocation, considering the socioeconomic and demographic factors influencing health risks across patient populations, can promote more equitable healthcare delivery. Finally, we discuss implementation issues and actions.</content>

    <title>Future Making as Emancipatory Inquiry: A Value‐Based Exploration of Desirable Futures</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In theirPoint, Wenzel, Cabantous, and Koch set out how future making encompasses a broad range of future‐oriented practices, including but not limited to planning, foresight, agile, and design‐driven approaches. In thisCounterpoint, we contest that viewing future making as any future‐oriented practice may also encompass unsuitable and detrimental practices, and may blur the concept to the point of hindering, rather than sustaining efforts at theorizing future making. Adopting a Pragmatist perspective, we suggest viewing future making as an emancipatory inquiry aimed at imagining and reifying desirable futures, that is, collective, value‐based judgements of what the future might and should be. This entails a reflective conversation with the social and material world, whereby concerned actors collectively deliberate, based on values, what futures are desirable – for themselves, for future generations, and the natural environment. In advancing this view, we also reject Wright'sCounterpointon future making as a management fad that ignores long‐standing research on scenario planning, and instead, we argue that future making should depart from the managerialism of scenario planning. The main contribution of ourCounterpointis to suggest a theoretical perspective for advancing our understanding of how desirable futures can be crafted in practice.</content>

    <title>Calibration in the Performance Evaluation Process</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this research, we examine the common practice of employee performance rating calibration, the process in which calibration committee members discuss, compare, and potentially adjust direct supervisors' initial employee performance ratings. Calibration introduces an additional step into the performance evaluation process aimed at correcting for any incompleteness, inconsistencies, or biases in the ratings. By empirically studying archival, survey, and demographic data from 737 employees and 114 direct supervisors from our participating company, we examine the incentive conflicts between direct supervisors and the remainder of the calibration committee and their effect on the calibration process outcomes. We predict and find evidence consistent with direct supervisors being strategic in the information they share in the calibration process, which results in reduced information sharing. We also examine whose ratings are adjusted. While there is pressure on calibration committees to make sufficient adjustments, not every supervisor's employee performance ratings need to be adjusted. We find that those direct supervisors who have lower costs associated with avoiding scrutiny and defending against adjustments in the calibration process, ceteris paribus, receive fewer adjustments and end up with higher ratings, even when controlling for employee performance. Our investigation sheds light on the complexities of the calibration process, thereby providing important insights to HR managers responsible for managing the process.</content>

    <title>Exploring Cultural Differences in &lt;scp&gt;AI&lt;/scp&gt;‐Based Interviews: Innovativeness and Justice Perceptions Among Job Applicants in the United States and South Korea</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is rapidly integrated into the recruiting process across cultures. However, the extent to which job applicants' responses to AI‐based recruitment vary across cultures remains unexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a cross‐cultural examination on job applicants' perceptions of justice and innovativeness of AI‐based interviews, focusing on American and South Korean cultures. Using scenario experiments, we found that Americans generally perceived AI‐based interviews as less fair than human‐based interviews regarding job relatedness, chance to perform, and two‐way communication. In contrast, Koreans showed little difference in justice perceptions between AI‐based and human‐based interviews, and they even perceived AI‐based interviews as fairer in certain justice dimensions, such as the chance to perform. Both American and Korean participants regarded AI‐based interviews as more innovative than human‐based interviews. Additionally, we found that Americans' lower perceptions of justice, such as job relatedness and two‐way communication, accounted for the negative impact of AI‐based interviews on organizational attractiveness. However, Koreans' higher perceptions of the chance to perform and innovativeness led to higher organizational attractiveness in AI‐based interviews compared to that in human‐based interviews. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of culture in understanding job applicants' responses toward AI‐based interviews. Based on these findings, we discuss implications, limitations, and future suggestions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Higher-order beliefs—beliefs about others’ beliefs—may be important for trading behavior and asset prices but have received little systematic empirical examination. Examining more than 20 years of evidence from the Robert Shiller Investor Confidence surveys, we find that investors’ higher-order beliefs provide substantial motivations for nonfundamental speculation–taking a stock market position that conflicts with one’s valuation of the market. To explore the equilibrium implications, we construct a model that matches the survey evidence and highlights that investors’ higher-order beliefs amplify stock market overreaction and excess volatility.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The U.S. stock market’s return during the first month of a quarter correlates strongly with returns in future months, but the correlation is negative if the future month is the first month of a quarter, and positive if it isn’t. These correlations offset, consistent with the well-known near-zero unconditional autocorrelation, yet they are pervasive, present across industries and countries. The pattern accords with a model in which investors extrapolate announced earnings to predict future earnings, not recognizing that earnings in the first month of a quarter are discretely less predictable than in prior months. Survey data support the model. (JEL G12, G14, G40)</content>

    <title>Expanding the Caring Capacity: An Integrative Review of Nontraditional Caregiving and the Workplace Caregiving Literature</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Management scholarship has long explored how life outside of work impacts work, and it has accumulated rich theoretical insights on how being a mother or father impacts one’s job and the organization. Importantly, however, this literature has adopted a limited scope of who and what caregiving embodies, overlooking the millions of workers globally who find themselves caring for a parent, a person with a disability, or someone who faces unique marginalization. We use new research on nontraditional caregiving (NTC) roles to enrich the topic of caregiving more broadly. As such, we provide an integrative review of 353 multidisciplinary workplace articles to detail the workplace outcomes explored in the literature and identify four caregiving dimensions that cannot be fully understood by a traditional caregiving framework alone. Further, we build a multilevel framework that identifies novel processes across roles, thereby bridging the nontraditional and traditional caregiving literatures and introducing ways to redirect future research. Overall, this review aims to show that caregiving should be viewed more broadly than it is currently, and this review aims to build a foundation for better understanding the complexities of caregiving in all its forms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The reordering of transactions from “high‐to‐low” is a controversial bank practice thought to maximize fees paid by low‐income customers on overdrawn accounts. We exploit a series of class‐action lawsuits that mandated that some banks cease the practice. Using alternative credit bureau data, we find that after banks cease high‐to‐low reordering, low‐income individuals reduce payday borrowing, increase consumption, realize long‐term improvements in financial health, and gain access to lower‐cost loans in the traditional financial system. These findings suggest that aggressive bank practices can create demand for alternative financial services and highlight an important link between the traditional and alternative financial systems.</content>

    <title>Tournaments of Destruction: Consumers Battling for Visibility</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research introduces tournaments of destruction, defined as staged and ritualized social performances involving entertainment and competitive rivalry in which consumers destroy valued material objects before a focused gathering. The conceptualization of tournaments of destruction is borne from a qualitative, phenomenological-based case study of low-income, low-power Black African male youth, who as members of the Izikhothane subculture in Soweto, South Africa, battle powerless anonymity by engaging in conspicuous consumption and the counterintuitive conspicuous destruction of high-end Italian apparel brands. Alexander’s theory of social performance provides an enabling lens to explore tournaments of destruction within a system of meanings, and findings provide insights about motivation to participate in a destructive subculture, the social performance of tournaments of destruction, and the agency and navigation of visibility within their hyper-local community. Emergent themes of spatiotemporal visibility, intentionality of destruction, focused gatherings and collective effervescence, and sociomoral condemnation contribute to understanding tournaments of destruction and other destructive enactments by social collectives both in pre-market and contemporary societies. This research extends Alexander’s theory of social performance and provides grounding for future work on destruction and visibility within contemporary consumer culture.</content>

    <title>How Algorithms Constrain Consumer Experience</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior literature is yet to explain how algorithms systematically constrain consumer experience (CX). To address this issue, we conducted a multi-method ethnographic study of consumers using fitness tracking software. We draw on the information science literature to demonstrate that the constitutive properties of information technology (IT) that underlie algorithms result in a set of restrictive fundamental interactional mechanisms imposed through algorithmic logics of legibility (what is selectively registered as input), visibility (what is selectively represented in output), and legitimacy (normative commitments embedded in input and output choices). We find that these mechanisms systematically constrain the distinct dimensions of the CX construct by eliciting consumption work. Consumers perform cognitive work to think through algorithmic limitations, practical work to accommodate those limitations, relational work to clarify algorithmic misrepresentation, and affective work to deal with algorithmic delegitimization. We make two contributions. First, our emergent framework not only demonstrates how algorithms systematically constrain CX, but is also more broadly relevant to consumer research because it enables accounting for the agency of IT. Second, we provide a corrective to the passive, emotion focused, view of CX by demonstrating how the consumption work of accommodating algorithmic limitations constrains the distinct dimensions of the CX construct.</content>

    <title>On the heels of giants: Internal network structure and the race to build on prior innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Strategy research has long been concerned with how firms build on the technological knowledge they create, and has focused on legal enforcement, complementary assets, and location decisions. Less attention has been paid to how internal firm structures support the appropriation of future cumulative innovations: what has been termed “generative appropriability.” Drawing on innovation and social network research, we propose that more integrated intrafirm inventor networks, and those with nearly decomposable structures, facilitate generative appropriability by accelerating within‐firm generation of follow‐on innovations, thus outpacing rivals. We find evidence for these effects in patent data from 1417 large corporations over 26 years. The acceleration effect is strongest in the critical first few years after an initial invention.Managerial SummaryInnovation is a cumulative and competitive process, so if firms fail to build on their own innovations quickly, rivals will capture value by doing so. We study how the degree to which a firm's inventors are connected to each other through co‐patenting relationships is related to its ability to build on its prior innovations faster than rivals. We find that firms whose researchers are connected to more of its other researchers are better able to quickly develop follow‐on innovations, but this advantage decays over time. We also find that the pattern of connectedness most associated with this outcome is one in which tight clusters of researchers in the core of the network are linked to each other by “bridging ties.”</content>

    <title>Undiversity, Inequity, and Exclusion in Supply Chains: The Unintended Fallout of Economic Sanctions and Consumer Boycotts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economic sanctions and consumer boycotts are common tools to punish organizations for undesirable behavior and attempt to coerce them to change their actions. However, these tools occasionally spill over beyond the intended recipients and affect guiltless supply chain members, jeopardizing the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion in supply chains. This study identifies four channels through which sanctions and boycotts propagate through supply chains. In particular, supply chain members can be affected by direct relationships with targeted organizations, disruptions in accessing foreign markets, inability to access technology, and logistics failures. Potential solutions include mapping supply chains, proactive cooperation, network analysis, and shortening supply chains. While the work provides a general framework for research and practitioners, it also identifies areas for further studies, such as the role of new technologies and the effect of sanctions and boycotts on supply chain sustainability.</content>

    <title>The Cost of Impatience in Dynamic Matching: Scaling Laws and Operating Regimes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study matching queues with abandonment. The simplest of these is the two-sided queue with servers on one side and customers on the other, both arriving dynamically over time and abandoning if not matched by the time their patience elapses. We identify nonasymptotic and universal scaling laws for the matching loss due to abandonment, which we refer to as the “cost of impatience.” The scaling laws characterize the way in which this cost depends on the arrival rates and the (possibly different) mean patience of servers and customers. Our characterization reveals four operating regimes identified by an operational measure of patience that brings together mean patience and utilization. The four regimes subsume the regimes that arise in asymptotic (heavy-traffic) approximations. The scaling laws, specialized to each regime, reveal the fundamental structure of the cost of impatience and show that its order of magnitude is fully determined by (i) a “winner-take-all” competition between customer impatience and utilization, and (ii) the ability to accumulate inventory on the server side. Practically important is that when servers are impatient, the cost of impatience is, up to an order of magnitude, given by an insightful expression where only the minimum of the two patience rates appears. Considering the trade-off between abandonment and capacity costs, we characterize the scaling of the optimal safety capacity as a function of costs, arrival rates, and patience parameters. We prove that the ability to hold inventory of servers means that the optimal safety capacity grows logarithmically in abandonment cost and, in turn, slower than the square-root growth in the single-sided queue.This paper was accepted by Baris Ata, stochastic models and simulation.Funding: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [Grant CMM-2137286].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01513 .</content>

    <title>Self-Guided Approximate Linear Programs: Randomized Multi-Shot Approximation of Discounted Cost Markov Decision Processes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Approximate linear programs (ALPs) are well-known models based on value function approximations (VFAs) to obtain policies and lower bounds on the optimal policy cost of discounted-cost Markov decision processes (MDPs). Formulating an ALP requires (i) basis functions, the linear combination of which defines the VFA, and (ii) a state-relevance distribution, which determines the relative importance of different states in the ALP objective for the purpose of minimizing VFA error. Both of these choices are typically heuristic; basis function selection relies on domain knowledge, whereas the state-relevance distribution is specified using the frequency of states visited by a baseline policy. We propose a self-guided sequence of ALPs that embeds random basis functions obtained via inexpensive sampling and uses the known VFA from the previous iteration to guide VFA computation in the current iteration. In other words, this sequence takes multiple shots at randomly approximating the MDP value function with VFA-based guidance between consecutive approximation attempts. Self-guided ALPs mitigate domain knowledge during basis function selection and the impact of the state-relevance-distribution choice, thus reducing the ALP implementation burden. We establish high-probability error bounds on the VFAs from this sequence and show that a worst-case measure of policy performance is improved. We find that these favorable implementation and theoretical properties translate to encouraging numerical results on perishable inventory control and options pricing applications, where self-guided ALP policies improve upon policies from problem-specific methods. More broadly, our research takes a meaningful step toward application-agnostic policies and bounds for MDPs.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.00038 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using data on 10,776 firms across 22 emerging markets, we show that both credit constraints and weak green management hold back corporate investment in green technologies embodied in new machinery, equipment, and vehicles. In contrast, investment in measures to explicitly reduce emissions and other pollution is mainly determined by the quality of a firm’s green management and less so by binding credit constraints. Data from the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register reveal the environmental impact of these organizational constraints. In areas where more firms are credit constrained and weakly managed, industrial facilities systematically emit more CO2and pollutants. A counterfactual analysis shows that credit constraints and weak management have respectively kept CO2emissions 4.5% and 2.3% above the levels that would have prevailed without such constraints. This is further corroborated by our finding that in localities where banks had to deleverage more due to the global financial crisis, carbon emissions by industrial facilities remained 5.6% higher a decade later.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00772 .</content>

    <title>Do Proprietary Costs Deter Insider Trading?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Insider trading conveys insiders’ private information to outsiders. This private information potentially benefits rival firms, which may reduce the competitive advantage of the insiders’ firms. Using a composite proprietary cost measure, we find proprietary costs are negatively associated with insiders’ purchases, especially when their trades are more likely to be informative to rivals. Consistent with proprietary costs increasing the costs of insider purchases and, hence, the expected benefits required to trade, insiders earn significantly higher abnormal profits when proprietary costs are higher. Exploiting settings with exogenous and event-driven variation in proprietary costs, we find insiders significantly reduce their purchases when noncompete agreement enforceability is high and before new product launches. Moreover, firms with higher proprietary costs are more likely to impose window-based insider trading restrictions and insiders with greater equity holdings reduce their purchases more strongly in the presence of proprietary costs. Finally, we provide evidence of real effects of insider trading on rivals’ investment decisions. We find that investments are associated with insiders’ purchases at rival firms, and these associations are stronger when proprietary costs at rivals are higher. Our findings indicate insiders and firms are aware of potential proprietary costs when insiders trade on private information and respond accordingly.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.02469 .</content>

    <title>How Framing Influences Strategic Interactions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In many settings, a person’s outcome depends not only on her own behavior, but also on her counterpart’s. Such strategic decisions have traditionally been studied using normative game theory, which assumes that people adopt equilibrium strategies and will reach the same decision, regardless of how the problem is described (framed). We examine a potentially important type of framing effect—focusing on how the relationship between players’ actions generates joint outcomes. Any strategic interaction can be described by either spelling out the outcomes of all possible action combinations (which we call “outcome framing,” or simply “O-framing”) or describing what will happen if different players choose the same action or choose different actions (which we call “relation framing,” or simply “R-framing”). O-framing has been the typical way to describe a strategic problem in prior work, whereas R-framing is commonly employed in real-life communications. We propose that these functionally equivalent frames induce different psychological processes and lead to different decisions: Relative to O-framing, R-framing increases players’ beliefs about their counterparts’ likelihood of coordinating on a cooperative option. We demonstrate this effect in the context of classic games such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma and the Stag Hunt. We find that, compared with O-framing, R-framing significantly increases people’s likelihood to choose the action that maximizes collective benefits rather than individual interests, and it does so by increasing beliefs that one’s partner will choose the same action as well. We derive conditions when this effect is likely to emerge and discuss the managerial implications of this research.This paper was accepted by Yuval Rottenstreich, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00518 .</content>

    <title>Estimating Stockout Costs and Optimal Stockout Rates: A Case on the Management of Ugly Produce Inventory</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Efficiently managing inventories requires an accurate estimation of stockout costs. This estimation is complicated by challenges in determining how to compensate consumers monetarily to ensure they will maintain the same level of utility they would have obtained had stockouts not occurred. This paper presents an analysis of these compensation costs as applied to the design of optimal stockout rates by an online retailer marketing to consumers aesthetically substandard fruits and vegetables rejected by mainstream grocery chains. Because growers face high uncertainty in their harvesting conditions and in the aesthetic quality of their crops and there are little data on hand to predict the value consumers attach to the availability of subpar produce, it is difficult to optimally match the supply of these products with consumers’ demand. Our analysis draws from a multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) choice model to calculate consumer compensations that the retailer can use to estimate the opportunity costs of stockouts to manage its inventory. We show that not taking into account these compensation costs could unduly inflate the optimal stockout rates for these products. Armed with these compensation cost estimates, we show how these costs can serve as incentives for retailers to source greater inventory amounts of imperfect produce from growers and how this will ultimately translate into less waste in the supply chain.This paper was accepted by Charles Corbett, operations management.Funding: Funding from Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (National Institute for Food and Agriculture, USDA) [Grant 2016-09900] is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03174 .</content>

    <title>Thirty Years of Managerial Mental Representations: A Review Guiding Conceptualization and Future Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managerial mental representations (MMRs) are mental constructs that structure cognitive content to guide perception and interpretation. MMRs have been examined across a broad spectrum of management research contexts, leading to the use of numerous related terms such as “mental representation,” “schema,” “mental model,” “cognitive frame,” “cognitive map,” and “mindset.” This proliferation of terms has caused considerable definitional overlap and ambiguity. To foster definitional clarity, this review systematically analyzes 206 articles employing any of 33 MMR terms used during the past 30 years. We identify the conceptual and functional definition facets of MMRs and use them to analyze commonalities and differences among the most prominent MMR terms. We further examine both established and emerging discussions surrounding the characteristics of MMRs. Established discussions focus on MMR content and levels of analysis, while emerging discussions explore MMR permanence and implicitness. We propose suggestions to advance each conversation. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we create a guiding framework aiding future research to conceptualize MMRs and navigate terminology choices. Finally, we propose two future research directions: integrating the content and process perspectives on MMRs and applying an MMR lens to examine the emergence of artificial intelligence in organizations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines venture capital's (VC) role in the geographic clustering of high‐growth startups. We exploit a rule change that disproportionately impacted U.S. regions that historically lacked VC financing via a restriction of banks to invest in the asset class. A one‐standard‐deviation increase in VCs' exposure to the rule led to a 20% decline in fund size and a 10% decrease in the likelihood of raising a follow‐on fund. Startups were not wholly cushioned: financing and valuations declined. Startups also moved out of impacted states after the rule change, likely exacerbating existing geographic disparity in entrepreneurship.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We exploit quasi-exogenous variation in passive ownership around the Russell 1000/2000 cutoff to explore the causal effects of passive ownership on the securities lending market. We find that passive ownership causes an increase in lendable supply and short interest, while lending fees remain largely unchanged. The utilization ratio—ie, the ratio of short interest over lendable supply—goes up, implying that shorting demand increases more than lendable supply. We argue that this additional demand results from an increase in the quality of lendable supply as passive funds are less likely to recall stock loans. This higher supply quality attracts informed short sellers, who improve the information efficiency around negative news releases and correct overpricing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ethnically diverse countries are more prone to conflict, but why do some groups engage in conflict, while others do not? I show that civil conflict in Africa is explained by ethnic groups’ cultural distance to the central government: an increase in cultural distance, proxied by linguistic distance, increases an ethnicity’s propensity to fight over government power. To identify this effect, I leverage within-ethnicity variation in linguistic distance resulting from power transitions between ethnic groups over time. I provide evidence that the effects can be attributed to differences in preferences over both the allocation and the type of public goods. (JEL D74, H41, J15, N47, O15, O17, Z13)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores global perceptions and understanding of climate change and policies, examining factors that influence support for climate action and the impact of different types of information. We conduct large-scale surveys with 40,000 respondents from 20 countries, providing new international data on attitudes toward climate change and respondents’ socioeconomic backgrounds and lifestyles. We identify three key perceptions affecting policy support: perceived effectiveness of policies in reducing emissions, their impact on low-income households, and their effect on respondents’ households (self-interest). Educational videos clarifying policy mechanisms increase support for climate policies; those merely highlighting climate change’s impacts do not. (JEL C83, D83, D91, Q54, Q58)</content>

We characterize our model behaviorally and investigate its comparative statics properties. We show that the model generates intuitive closed-form solutions in equilibrium settings where firms can choose price, quality, and advertising. In addition, we show that the model allows for flexible substitution patterns and changes in market shares across choice sets. We demonstrate that our model can be easily identified and can outperform alternatives in demand prediction. (JEL D11, D21, D43, M37)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The transition toward an intangible-intensive economy reshapes financial systems by creating a self-perpetuating savings glut in the production sector. As intangibles become increasingly important, firms hoard liquidity to finance investment in intangibles of limited pledgeability. Firms’ savings feed cheap leverage to financial intermediaries and allow intermediaries to bid up asset prices, which in turn encourages firms to save more for asset creation. This paper develops a macrofinance model that offers a coherent account of rising corporate savings, debt-fueled growth of intermediaries, declining interest rates, and rising asset valuation. Along these secular trends, endogenous financial risk accumulates. (JEL E43, E44, G12, G21, G31, G32)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I present a new theory of oligopoly and markups in general equilibrium, based on an innovative, scalable hedonic demand system, which I take to the data for the universe of US public firms. In my model, firms compete in a network of product market rivalries that emerge endogenously out of the characteristics of the products they supply. I estimate that consumer surplus is almost three times as large as profits; decompose firm-level markups into metrics of quality-adjusted productivity and market centrality; and analyze the extent, evolution, and drivers of monopoly power in the United States between 1995 and 2021.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How quickly does a fiat money become valueless? I study the speculative hyperinflation equilibria of continuous-time economies with decentralized markets where money is essential. I establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which money dies in finite time. A necessary condition is that the liquidity return of money grows unbounded as the value of money approaches zero. Under CRRA preferences, the longevity of money shrinks with the money growth rate and the frequency of liquidity needs, but it increases with seller’s market power. Money duration also depends on the strictness of legal restrictions and the rates of return of competing currencies. (JEL E31, E42, E51, E52, E62)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper identifies a credit-supply contraction that arises endogenously after trade liberalization. Banks with loan portfolios concentrated in sectors exposed to competition from China face an increase in nonperforming loans after China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. As a result, they reduce the supply of credit to firms, irrespective of the firm’s sector of operation. This cut in credit translates into lower employment, investment, and output. Through this mechanism, the financial channel amplifies the shock to firms already hit by import competition from China and passes it on to firms in sectors expected to expand upon trade liberalization.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore how decision makers utilize external and internal knowledge in problems characterized by temporal complexity where there is a separation between action and outcome. Many strategic and organizational decisions have longer-term consequences, yet behavioral models of learning have underexplored this class of problems. Consequently, we do not know much about the role of external knowledge in tackling temporally complex problems, let alone how it interacts with internal knowledge from experiential learning processes. Our computational analyses show that, although having a greater level of external knowledge is generally advantageous, its positive impact diminishes notably or can even become negative when external knowledge is limited. Surprisingly, decision makers operating with limited external knowledge can perform worse than those without any external guidance at all. In a temporally complex problem, knowing what to do at any given point is not sufficient as one still needs to undertake a long sequence of actions before reaching the goal. In other words, external knowledge does not guarantee that optimal actions will be chosen in subsequent decision-making situations. This dynamic may lead the decision makers to overvalue actions that serve as stepping stones to the available external knowledge and undervalue alternative actions that may provide more desirable paths toward the goal.Funding: This research was supported by the Yonsei University Research Fund of 2021 [2021-22-0098].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.16469 .</content>

    <title>Borrowing Based on Great Expectations: Evidence from the Origins of Fracking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use the origins of fracking to study how people respond to a large and uncertain permanent income shock. Following the arrival of news in 2003 that fracking was commercially viable, the average person owning rights to natural gas deposits in the Barnett Shale could plausibly expect to earn a present value of about $33,000 from leasing the rights to energy firms. Anticipating the income, people who signed leases after 2006 borrowed $5,400 more than nonleaseholders as of 2006. Leases not yet signed could not be collateralized, suggesting that expectations of increased permanent income rather than relaxed credit constraints drove leaseholder borrowing. A consumption smoothing model that uses observed well productivity and Hotelling’s rule for pricing nonrenewable resources suggests that borrowing as of 2006 was rational to conservative. When natural gas prices unexpectedly crashed during 2009–2019, leaseholders reduced their debt and had delinquency and bankruptcy rates that indicate limited financial distress, suggesting that their borrowing prior to signing a lease was not impulsive.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04214 .</content>

    <title>Nudging Tactics for Enhanced Compliance With Condition‐Based Maintenance Guidelines</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Condition‐based preventive maintenance (CB‐PM), dependent on robust and precise indicators of equipment quality, stands to gain advantages from the integration of sensor technologies. Yet, the effectiveness of such systems relies on an important factor: people. Even in possession of ideal CB‐PM policies, imperfect adherence can lead to higher equipment downtime, maintenance costs, and increased safety hazards. Here, we describe a normative model of optimal CB‐PM policy determination; specifically, a generalized means by which to determine a valuemaximizing quality threshold as a guideline for triggering PM (preventative maintenance). Motivated by field data, we consider the opportunity cost of not adhering to such optimal policies; that is, premature or delayed responses. We design and execute a controlled laboratory study, exposing participants to two critical manipulations that we theorize might influence adherence: (1) The presence of a supplemental secondary signal, of a type common to time‐based preventive maintenance (TB‐PM), (2) a pre‐task priming intended to emphasize the value of discretized task completion. Results showed that the combination of CB‐PM and TB‐PM signals, along with completion priming, significantly increases adherence to CB‐PM guidelines. We demonstrate that individuals exposed to this combination of treatments forfeit far less value than those receiving CB‐PM signals alone.</content>

    <title>Knowledge-Based Assets in Business Groups: A Dynamic Capabilities View of Complementarity and Rents</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We extend the business group (BG) literature by combining the knowledge-based perspective and the dynamic capabilities view to explain the benefits of group affiliation. In the BG context, group affiliates can use not only their own firm-level knowledge-based assets (KBAs), but also group-level KBAs. While prior research examines the efficiencies of BG affiliation by comparing BG affiliates to non-affiliated firms, we ask to what extent affiliate-specific rents from group-level KBAs vary among affiliate firms and why. To explain this variation, we identify affiliate-specific rents generated by the complementarity between firm- and group-level KBAs. Drawing from the dynamic capabilities view, we developed a framework to explain the sources of such complementarity and tested a series of hypotheses. This study provides empirical evidence using firm-level data on 524 affiliates of keiretsu groups in Japan from 1985 to 2015. To measure KBAs and their characteristics, we use data on 11.5 million patents matched to the sample firms. This study provides a knowledge-based perspective to explain BG affiliation benefits and the persistence of BGs as an organizational form of economic activity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper reviews the transformative role of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in Human Resource (HR) management, from a practice perspective, highlighting both opportunities and challenges and laying out a use-inspired future research agenda. This scoping review is grounded in insights from a unique Summit held in Spring 2024, which brought together HR academic scholars with dozens of Fortune 500 Chief Human Resource Officers (CHROs) and their top technical leaders to discuss the workforce implications of GenAI. The paper identifies six key themes from the Summit practitioners: GenAI as disruptive and transformative, data as competitive advantage, adoption challenges, potential ethical abuses, the experimentation imperative, and the critical role of CHROs. These six themes provide a foundation for future research directions, which are discussed regarding six functional HR areas: recruitment and selection, training and development, performance management, job and work design, talent management, and compensation and benefits. The research agenda in each area emphasizes the need for academic researchers to understand and address the practical challenges posed by GenAI. Overcoming these substantive challenges will demand meaningful effort and a keen willingness to learn, on the part of both HR leaders and scholars. The paper concludes with a call to action for management scholars to engage in use-inspired research that bridges the gap between academic knowledge and practical HR challenges.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An entrepreneur makes offers to multiple investors to fund a project that requires a minimum investment. Concerned about other investors' decisions, each investor strategically communicates information about the project to others. When investors have conflicts of interest, those with contractually stronger incentives to invest attempt to persuade others to invest. Depending on the project's ex ante quality, the entrepreneur may promise investors different returns to create conflicts of interest and induce persuasion, or may promise investors an identical return to align their interests and induce truthful communication. The paper illustrates a new motivation for syndication and hierarchy within syndicates.</content>

    <title>Exaptation in Platforms: A Theory of Origins, Mechanisms, and Consequences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractBeyond gradual refinement (“adaptation”), IT systems evolve through “exaptation”—the emergence of novel functionality when apps interact with evolving technological and competitive environments. This nine-year study of 625 Android apps across 63 countries shows that real options embedded in app design fuel exaptation, enhancing market performance and user retention. We conceptualize IT exaptation as distinct from adaptation. Whereas adaptation refines, exaptation transforms evolutionary trajectories. Strategic options and operational options enable developers to capitalize on emergent opportunities. For practitioners, this study explains why seemingly similar apps develop divergent trajectories when exposed to identical platform innovations. It suggests that app developers should prioritize embedding flexibility in initial designs—creating not just adaptable systems, but ones with intrinsic leapfrogging potential via exaptation.</content>

    <title>Should I Stay or Should I Go? A Relational Biopsychosocial Perspective on Neurodivergent Talent, Career Satisfaction and Turnover Intention</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Neuroinclusion in human resources management (HRM) research and practice should go beyond the business case argument for neurodiversity (ND) to move to a nuanced understanding of harnessing neurodivergent talent. We argue for a biopsychosocial HRM perspective from an explicit non‐ableist stance, to illuminate in‐work experience to inform employer positions as proactive carers. We conceptualize a model of relational biopsychosocial neurodivergent talent inclusion informed by Organizational Support Theory, comprising employee (person), environment, and people characteristics, to guide a realist and co‐creational investigation into (a) neurodivergent conditions and wellbeing, (b) the role of tailored adjustment, and (c) the influence of psychosocial support on what makes people stay (career satisfaction) and makes them go (turnover intention). We collected data from 985 ND employees across a range of UK‐based organizations with existing interests in neuroinclusion. Neurodivergent condition co‐occurrence was common (complex neurotypes), yet experience varied by condition across the study measures. The number of neurodivergent conditions, wellbeing, knowledge of neurodivergence, support from staff and the manager, and psychological safety predicted career satisfaction. Support from the manager, psychological safety, and career satisfaction predicted turnover intention. Tailored adjustment (to neurotype) became non‐significant in each regression equation once other measures were added. We finally found support for a serial mediation where the association between psychological safety and turnover intention was sequentially mediated by wellbeing and career satisfaction. We discuss the need for a more holistic, ecological understanding of potentially vulnerable neurodivergent talent which considers wellbeing, the importance of the psychosocial environment, and the opportunity to realize career ambition in equal measures. We call for future research to develop our understanding of the role of the psychosocial environment in neuroinclusive HRM practices including domain‐specific psychological safety.</content>

    <title>Is accounting the English language of business? The role of language in IFRS adoption and information loss</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine whether and how language barriers influence a country’s decision to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Our findings reveal that as the distance between a country’s official language and English (i.e., linguistic distance) increases, the likelihood and speed of a country adopting IFRS decrease. Our evidence is consistent with the notion that language barriers impose significant information costs on preparers and users of financial reporting, making IFRS costlier to adopt for countries with severe language barriers. In further analysis, we find that such information costs materialize when these countries eventually adopt IFRS. Specifically, firms in countries with the most severe language barriers experience a worsened post-adoption information environment, as evidenced by increased analyst forecast errors and widened bid-ask spreads. Overall our study suggests that language barriers impede achievement of international accounting harmonization by increasing the costs associated with adopting, understanding, and applying IFRS.</content>

    <title>The Evolutionary Stability of Moral Foundations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Moral Foundations Theory is an influential empirical description of moral perception. According to this theory, individuals make moral judgments based on five distinct “moral foundations:” Care, Fairness, Loyalty, Authority and Sanctity. We provide a theory that explores the claimed evolutionary basis for these moral foundations. The theory conceptualizes these five moral foundations as specific modifications of fitness payoffs in a 2 × 2 game. We find that the five foundations are distinguishable from each other and evolutionarily stable. However, the five foundations are not a minimal set: strict subsets of the five moral foundations suffice to describe all preferences that are evolutionarily stable. Not all evolutionarily stable foundations deliver social-fitness improvement over the Nash equilibrium in the fitness game: we characterize which do. Finally, we study moral overdrive, i.e., the situation in which the moral component of preferences totally dominates fitness payoffs and drives decision-making entirely. While every one of the five foundations is compatible with moral overdrive in at least one fitness game, there is no fitness game in which moral overdrive is compatible with social-fitness improvement. These results are partially extended to n × n games. We derive two testable implications from the theory and find empirical support for them.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Combating Counterfeit Products: Anti-counterfeiting Technology and Law Enforcement</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Counterfeits cause tremendous damages to brand companies by eroding their market shares and reducing customers’ buying motives. In response to such damages, many companies choose to develop and deploy anti-counterfeiting technologies, thus preventing counterfeiters from imitating their products. The companies can also rely on law enforcement exerted by local regulatory authorities to outlaw counterfeits. In this paper, we study how brand companies may leverage the two approaches effectively. Specifically, we consider an authentic company that sells its products to a market that is administered by its regulatory authority. A counterfeiter exists in the market and may imitate the product offered by the authentic company. To combat counterfeiting, the authentic company may invest in anti-counterfeiting technology with uncertain outcomes, aiming to help customers effectively distinguish between genuine and fake products. We show that an increase in the authentic company’s anti-counterfeiting capability does not necessarily yield a higher profit. We also find that, in equilibrium, the anti-counterfeiting effort exerted by the authentic company does not necessarily decrease with the penalty levied by the authority, even though they serve the same purpose. Our analysis further highlights the importance of coupling law enforcement type with anti-counterfeiting capability in the cooperation with the regularity authority. Specifically, when having a high (low, respectively) anti-counterfeiting capability, the authentic company should promote a cooperation that focuses on preventive (corrective, respectively) law enforcement.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The concept of retail pass-through, including own-brand and cross-brand pass-throughs, is critical for channel management strategies. With a classical common retailer channel, our paper provides a novel perspective on channel pricing through the lens of retail pass-through, synthesizing and extending the existing results. By employing the conduct parameter approach, our study identifies two important driving forces behind channel pricing strategies:vertical strategic effectandcompetition moderation effect. In a symmetric setting, extant research has sidestepped the (upstream) competition moderation effect stemming from the retailer’s various cross-brand pass-through behaviors by assuming symmetric-at-symmetric prices. However, we find that this horizontal effect can outperform the previously esteemed vertical strategic effect, and the relative strength between the two forces is the key to formulating optimal channel pricing decisions. We apply the unifying framework to two well-known strategic questions in channel pricing—channel price leadership and product line pricing—leading to results qualitatively different from the literature. Our study not only emphasizes the necessity to account for both vertical and horizontal effects in channel analysis but also calls for practitioners in channel management to recognize the crucial role of cross-brand pass-through behavior in determining optimal channel pricing policy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online marketplaces such as Amazon and Tmall have been expanding services to boost the growth of their ecosystems. One is information service on sharing privately gathered massive consumer data that is unavailable to their sellers, and the other is financing service, e.g., Amazon Lending and Ant Financial, aiming to provide accessible and affordable financial support for small and medium-sized sellers. This paper develops a game-theoretical model to examine the interplay between information sharing and financing services on a retail platform, particularly when sellers are financially constrained. The results show that while the information-sharing service always makes the platform less likely to provide an attractive financing service, the financing service also makes the information-sharing service less likely to be provided under certain conditions. These conditions depend on the structure of capital market and the seller’s initial working capital. We find that such misalignment between these two services can be resolved by charging a fixed payment for the information service, leading to improved operational efficiency and social welfare. We finally extend our analytical results and managerial insights to general settings, demonstrating the robustness of our findings. Our findings could provide useful guidance for platform practitioners in designing integrated information-sharing and financing services.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Delay in negotiations is common in many settings, but the effects of delay have rarely been studied empirically in the field. We measure the causal effects of delay on bargaining outcomes using data from millions of negotiations on eBay. We find that for both buyers and sellers, the longer the bargaining party delays, the less likely the opponent is to continue the negotiation by countering, and the fewer rounds the negotiation takes to complete. The effects of delay are robust; they exist even under short amounts of delay (under six hours) and for negotiations for low-priced goods. We find that these effects are consistent with models of strategic delay, in which delay acts as a signal of bargaining power.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01562 .</content>

    <title>Tax Strategy Disclosure: A Greenwashing Mandate?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the effects of aqualitativetax disclosure mandate aimed at improving tax transparency and compliance by imposing reputational costs for firms. We use, as an exogenous shock, the 2016 UK reform that required large businesses to disclose their tax strategy. We find that treated firms—those that must publish a tax strategy report—also significantly increase the volume of tax strategy disclosure in their annual reports, but this disclosure contains more boilerplate. The standalone tax strategy reports contain narratives similar to those in the annual reports, are sticky, and their quality is correlated with those of disclosures on gender and human rights. Turning to real behavioral changes, we document no significant effect on tax planning across several proxies and firm characteristics. While we find that the mandate increased media attention on treated firms, our results suggest that this enforcement channel might not work in the context of qualitative disclosure, which may be hard to verify for outside stakeholders. Even in subsamples of firms for which we would expect higher reputational costs, we document similar responses. Taken together, our findings indicate that mandating qualitative tax disclosure has incentivized firms to portray themselves as good tax citizens without changing their practices.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Over recent years, companies have been increasingly adopting algorithmic decision systems (ADS) to replace humans. In this paper, we focus on how ADS facilitates human managers’ decision making rather than replacing humans altogether in the context of inventory ordering decisions, specifically on the effect of providing ADS performance information to human managers. Using a pair of field experiments, our results suggest that providing ADS performance information can improve their inventory ordering decisions. Interestingly, providing both positive and negative ADS performance information enhances human managers’ inventory ordering decisions, with the latter proving even more effective. Our analyses reveal that compliance and deliberation are two mechanisms through which ADS performance transparency influences inventory ordering decisions. Furthermore, we explore the heterogeneous effect and find that disclosing ADS performance information is more helpful for human managers overseeing products with lower sales and higher uncertainty, thus solving the pain points where human managers rely on algorithmic recommendations the most. Our results also show that ADS performance information serves as an equalizer that benefits low-performing managers more. These results demonstrate the importance of algorithm performance transparency in the human adoption of ADS and shed light on the managerial implications of using ADS within corporations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I document that the network structure of the online economy significantly contributes to rising industry concentration. Firms that are central in the online economy benefit more from increased economies of scale, decreased search costs, and network effects resulting from digitalization. Industries with firms that are more central become more concentrated and central firms have larger increases in market share. These results are driven by firms’ ability to generate revenue, as evidenced by central firms earning higher risk-adjusted returns and having more positive earnings surprises. Centrality is also associated with increasing productivity, but profitability only increases for central firms in business-to-consumer industries.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the performance consequences of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) successions, focusing on the types of board chairs and firm ownership structures. While CEO successions can bring adaptation benefits and performance gains through strategic realignment, they can also cause disruption costs and performance losses by disturbing stakeholder relationships. We examine how the presence of a predecessor CEO or an independent individual as board chair affects postsuccession performance differently depending on the level of family control. Our analysis of a panel dataset of S&amp;P 1500 firms from 2003 to 2022 and a series of robustness tests provide strong support for our predictions. We found that with increasing family control, predecessor CEOs as board chairs have a more positive effect on postsuccession performance, while the opposite holds true for independent board chairs. Further, within family-controlled firms, the effect of predecessor retention is stronger for outside than inside CEO successions. Our findings expand CEO succession and board chair research by demonstrating that the value of a board chair type after a CEO succession depends on a firm’s ownership structure, particularly the degree of family control.</content>

    <title>The Impact of Green Energy Production on Healthiness Perceptions and Preferences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research finds that products that have been produced using renewable (“green”) energy, and labeled as such, are perceived to be healthier and, consequently, are more likely to be purchased than otherwise identical products produced with non-green or conventional energy. The effect of green energy production on the perceived healthiness of food products is found to be driven via perceived contagion: Consumers believe that the “good for you” essence of green energy is transferred to the food product during the production process, thereby rendering it healthier and more preferred. Evidence for this relationship is found across 8 studies (N = 1762) using a variety of common food products. Alternative accounts are assessed and ruled out, and it is also found that the impact of green energy production on preferences is moderated by consumers' health orientation. These findings contribute to the growing literature on the broader topic of sustainability initiatives and research examining the complexity and nuances of consumer responses to sustainable products and initiatives.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Balancing Flexibility and Performance in Online Resource AllocationHow do firms optimize resource allocation strategies when frequent adjustments are costly or restricted? A new study published in Operations Research by David Simchi-Levi, Yunzong Xu, and Jinglong Zhao explores this challenge through the lens of “Blind Network Revenue Management and Bandits with Knapsacks Under Limited Switches.” The paper investigates the impact of a switching constraint, which limits the number of times a firm can adjust allocations, on dynamic decision making, demand learning, and resource management. By establishing matching upper and lower regret bounds, the authors show how the statistical complexity of online learning changes when both resource and switching constraints are present. Their findings reveal that the optimal regret rate follows a piecewise-constant function of the switching budget, providing key insights into algorithmic design for constrained decision making. The study’s simulations demonstrate that firms can maintain strong performance and significantly reduce adjustments, offering practical implications for industries with operational rigidity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Achieving system‐level change for climate transitions is needed, and incremental efforts are widely considered insufficient. Drawing on neo‐Schumpeterian, cultural‐institutionalist, and post‐structuralist theories, thisPoint‐Counterpointdebate explores the systemic barriers including neoliberal policies, corporate hegemony, and growth‐driven cultural logics which inhibit the kind of change that is needed to mitigate increasingly devastating climatic conditions. Our contributors propose a range of potential solutions which may break these barriers and deliver the required radical system‐level change. These include further and better democratization, quixotic institutional work so as to undermine dominant cultural templates, the use of various counter‐hegemonic practices, and the development of alternative forms of organizing. In this introduction, we explore contact and departure points between the three positions and offer some critical reflections and future research questions on the idea of system‐level change.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the capital market implications of common investor relations (IR) representation, a phenomenon in which multiple public firms share the same external IR representative. Using a difference‐in‐differences research design, I document that common IR representation is associated with greater overlap in institutional ownership and sell‐side analyst coverage as well as similarities in disclosure practices among clients—even those operating in different industries. These effects culminate in heightened return comovement among firms sharing IR representation. My findings provide insight into the role of IR companies as capital market gatekeepers and suggest that when a firm outsources its IR function, the IR company influences its capital market connectivity.</content>

    <title>Team-Enacted Use versus Developer-Needed Use of Agile Practices: How Perceptual (In-)Congruence and Team Feedback-Seeking Shape Developer Well-Being</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Are agile practices always beneficial for developers? Although agile methods, such as daily stand-ups or pair programming, are designed to enhance flexibility and productivity, developers often experience a mismatch between the team-enacted use of these practices and their own individual needs. Using daily survey responses from 149 agile developers (1,510 observations), our study uncovers a crucial yet overlooked factor; perceived (in-)congruence between team-enacted and developer-needed agile practices significantly impacts developer well-being. We show that alignment between the use and need of agile practices is associated with higher well-being, whereas mismatches—both excessive and insufficient agile practices—can be detrimental. Interestingly, we find that frequent team feedback seeking amplifies the negative effects of misalignment but does not enhance well-being when alignment is achieved. These findings challenge the assumption that the use of agile practices is inherently beneficial and highlight the need for a tailored, developer-centric approach. For organizations, the key takeaway is clear. A “one-size-fits-all” approach to agile practices can backfire. Instead, fostering alignment through adaptive work environments, flexible agile practice use, and targeted interventions can promote sustainable developer well-being and long-term agile team effectiveness.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a new methodology to estimate subjective beliefs from hypothetical choice data. Our identification approach is based on the novel insight that by varying the amount of information on future realizations of stochastic variables, discrete choice experiments can identify not only preferences, but also subjective beliefs. We formally prove this result in a general setting and apply it to design a strategic survey instrument to measure Rajasthani parents’ subjective beliefs over the joint distribution of girls’ age of marriage, education, and marriage match quality. Our approach allows us to quantify the importance of perceived marriage market returns to education and youth, and perform various counterfactual simulation exercises. We find that eliminating the perceived marriage market return to education causes a 60% drop in the number of girls still in school at age-16, and almost none continue their education by age-18. Responses to our strategic survey instrument allow us accurately to predict realized schooling trajectories in follow-up data we collect from the same sample five years after our experimental data collection.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: General Behavioral Impact of Smart System Warnings: A Case of Advanced Driving Assistance Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise of the Internet of Things has led to a surge in smart products with various embedded sensors that can provide alerts and warnings to users. However, these alerts can also influence user general behavior, which has implications for product and service design. In this study, we evaluate the effect of Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) warnings on general driving behavior using automotive telematics data from a large automotive company. We categorize ADAS systems in terms of the urgency of response required by their warning signals and theorize that this urgency triggers different types of cognitive responses. Specifically, less urgent alerts lead to deliberate learning (System 2), improving driving behavior, while highly urgent warnings trigger automatic responses (System 1), potentially leading to risk compensation and worsening driving behavior. Our results confirm that the impact of ADAS warnings on driving behavior varies based on the urgency of the required response to warnings. The presence of a blind spot detection warning, which is less urgent with no immediate action, reduces the daily number of hard braking (speeding) events by 6.76% (9.34%). In contrast, lane departure and forward collision warnings, both of which are highly urgent and require immediate responses, increase the daily number of hard braking (speeding) events by 5.65% (5.34%). Additionally, we find that, over time, the positive impact of the blind spot detection feature improves, while the negative impact of the lane departure and forward collision features worsens. Finally, we quantify the indirect impact of ADAS features on collision rates through driving behavior. Specifically, we find that the presence of the blind spot detection feature decreases the collision rate by 2.17% (3.14%) through a reduction in hard braking (speeding) incidents. In contrast, the presence of lane departure and forward collision features reduces the safety benefits of preventing collisions by 1.71% (1.66%) due to an increase in hard braking (speeding) events. Our results demonstrate how user behavior varies with the type of ADAS based on the urgency of warnings and the need to integrate user behavior into the design of smart features such as ADAS and related services.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Enterprise Social Media Platform Design and Knowledge Worker Productivity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Companies often use enterprise social media platforms (ESMPs) to promote helping behavior among knowledge workers and to improve their productivity. However, many ESMP implementations have had mixed success due to employee reluctance to engage with the platform (e.g. by requesting and giving help). Prominent ESMPs have added varying design features to promote helping behavior, but the effectiveness of individual design features remains unclear. Our paper studies this using a laboratory experiment that consists of two studies. In Study 1, we explore the effect of individual design features on a participant’s decision to make and answer help requests, and the impact that has on their performance. Our first two treatments vary the level of platform helping behavior visible to participants. Our third treatment sets helping goals that participants can complete by making and answering help requests and rewards them with private badges for doing so. We find that only the treatment with helping goals and badges results in a significant 5.5% increase in participant performance. It achieves this primarily by increasing a participant’s propensity to request help and, to a lesser degree, their propensity to answer help requests. In Study 2, we show that similar improvements can be achieved with just a helping goal that asks participants to help others (without a badge). This speaks to the effectiveness of using goal setting motivation to leverage an individual’s intrinsic motivation to help others, even when it comes at a cost to themselves. Interestingly, we further show that helping goals that explicitly ask participants to help others also encourage participants to request more help, increasing the overall use of the platform. Based on our findings, we encourage companies to adopt ESMPs with badges for the helping goals they have. We also encourage ESMPs that do not have badges to consider adding them natively to their platforms.</content>

    <title>Confronting the Limits of Symbolic Actions: How Entrepreneurs Narrow the Presentation-Performance Gap</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs often skillfully leverage symbolic actions to manage impressions and gain acceptance for their innovations. Impression management can generate interest but also heighten expectations beyond an innovation’s capabilities, creating a gap between entrepreneurs’ symbolic presentations and an innovation’s performance. To convince critical audiences, entrepreneurs need to not just manage impressions but also show how their innovations will integrate and work in situ. Yet, little research explains what happens when symbolic actions meet their limits. How do entrepreneurs respond when critical audiences challenge their symbolic actions? We examine how 28 digital health start-ups were challenged by a critical audience (buyers), revealing a gap between entrepreneurs’ symbolic presentations and the performance of their innovations. We examine how entrepreneurs managed this gap with buyers at 13 organizations and identify three pathways. Continuing to manage impressions obfuscated the discovery of integration work, widening the gap. Iterating with substantive adaptations did not sufficiently narrow the gap. Only entrepreneurs who recalibrated expectations were able to enlist buyers in the mutual discovery of integration work. These entrepreneurs shared the costs of narrowing the gap with buyers, despite earlier symbolic promises. We contribute to an emerging appreciation of the duality of symbolic actions by explaining what happens when entrepreneurs’ symbolic actions are challenged and how their responses can exacerbate or eradicate that challenge.Funding: The authors acknowledge the financial support of the Harvard Business School and the Questrom School of Business, Boston University.</content>

    <title>Nonparametric Estimation of Sponsored Search Auctions and Impact of Ad Quality on Search Revenue</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents an empirical model of sponsored search auctions where advertisers are ranked by bid and ad quality. Our model is developed under the “incomplete information” setting with a general quality scoring rule. We establish nonparametric identification of the advertiser’s valuation and its distribution given observed bids and introduce novel nonparametric estimators. Using Yahoo! search auction data, we estimate value distributions and study the bidding behavior across product categories. We also conduct a counterfactual analysis to evaluate the impact of different quality scoring rules on the auctioneer’s revenue. Product-specific scoring rules can enhance auctioneer revenue by at most 24.3% at the expense of advertiser profit (−28.3%) and consumer welfare (−30.2%). The revenue-maximizing scoring rule depends on market competitiveness.This paper was accepted by Jean-Pierre Dube, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada under the Insight Development Grant [Grant 430-2022-00841] to D.

    <title>The Economics of Advice: Evidence from Start-up Mentoring</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the role of advice in early firm development and growth, drawing on detailed data from a global program where angel investors and venture capitalists (VCs) mentored founders over several months. Leveraging variation in mentors’ availability to support start-ups because of personal scheduling conflicts, I find that advice significantly improves start-ups’ future market performance. To explore how advice shapes early firm development, I develop a novel typology of start-up activities, finding that a defining element of mentors’ advice is to do less and learn more. Although angels and VCs are consistent in this message, they differ significantly in when they choose to advise start-ups in achieving their business objectives. Angels are more likely than VCs to help founders design and execute product market experiments, whereas VCs provide more mentoring support on business analysis and planning tasks. I find evidence consistent with the hypothesis that experimentation is a skill developed via learning-by-doing, and angels have a skill advantage in that domain because of having more operational experience.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: The author acknowledges support from the Government of Canada’s Strategic Innovation Fund [Grant 811949] and RBC Borealis Graduate Fellowship [Grant 2018-0439].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05115 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using novel data on 1,240 credit agreements, we investigate sources of contractual complexity in the leveraged loan market. Although negative covenants are widespread, carve-out and deductible clauses that qualify them are as frequent. We propose simple and comprehensive measures of contractual weakness based on the usage of such clauses. The economic significance of the actions allowed by these clauses and the market-wide price reaction that followed the 2017 J.Crew restructuring, a high-profile use of such contractual elements, support this interpretation. Leveraged buyouts, large transactions, and nonbank funding are conducive to weaker contractual terms for credit agreements.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01496 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traffic safety poses a persistent challenge for society and public policy. Conventional law enforcement by human police is often cost-ineffective because of information asymmetry and negative externalities of unsafe driving behaviors. Automated enforcement, in the form of traffic cameras on the road, has gained prominence in recent decades, yet its effectiveness and underlying mechanisms remain debated. This study examines the impact of traffic cameras on road safety using longitudinal data from a metropolitan city in China. We distinguish between advanced cameras, which use machine learning to detect various traffic violations and constantly record video, and conventional cameras, which rely on triggered image capture for a limited number of violations. Using an event study design with staggered camera installations at road intersections, we observe a significant and sustained reduction in accidents near advanced cameras, compared with locations with no cameras or only conventional cameras. Further analysis identifies three key mechanisms driving the effects of advanced cameras: (i) automated detection effect—superior technical capabilities to automate violation detection; (ii) real-time recording effect—continuous monitoring and recording capability to augment accident cause identification; and (iii) driver learning effect—technology-enabled deterrence that increases driver awareness of these cameras and encourages behavioral adjustments to mitigate accident risks.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Marketers know the importance of online reviews, but what can be done to improve the prompts asking consumers to review? Across eight studies, the present work shows that a prompt that encourages writing reviews for a close audience enhances consumers’ use of narrative language. A growing body of literature reveals that narratives are powerful persuasive devices for shaping audiences’ beliefs, including when reading online reviews. However, little is known about what aspects shape the communicator’s use of narrative language in the first place. A prompt that encourages writers to imagine as though they were writing for a close audience increases narrativity, an effect mediated by consumers’ tendency to write in a natural, less effortful style when writing for a close (vs. distant) audience. The effect is attenuated when people write about material (vs. experiential) purchases, and when people write on a smartphone (vs. PC). Consumers find writing for close others to be at least as enjoyable as several other prompts, but with improved outcomes for firms. As most review sites provide limited guidance on how to write, this research offers an inexpensive and scalable intervention to improve reviews and the review writing experience.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations often feature digital and information technology (IT) units, suggesting that managers perceive digital technology as different from IT. However, these units do not coexist in silos; rather, they interact in pursuit of organizational goals. In this study, we investigate the interactions between the digital and IT units of three organizations undergoing digital transformation. We find that these interactions reflect three relationships with varying dynamics. The interplay of these dynamics shape organization’s digital transformation efforts. We outline three considerations for managing these dynamics productively. First, we outline conditions that determine the dynamic (e.g., synergistic or conflicting) more likely to manifest. These conditions depend on the (in)compatibility between the units’ need to interact and the strategic, routine or technology rationales they draw on. We caution against seeking compatibility at all costs. Rather, managers should consider the context of each interaction before deciding how to influence these dynamics. Second, we found that interpersonal relationships, hiring talent with diverse perspectives, or establishing idea exchange forums can help to foster productive collaborations. However, they alone do not determine these dynamics. Third, cross-unit relationships is important for accomplishing organizational goals like digital transformation. Managers should proactively nurture such relationships to foster collaboration among units.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Optimal Processing and Trading for a Commodity in the Presence of Inventory Conversion Flexibility and Random Supply</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we present a decision support system used by an agricultural cooperative in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to purchase, blend, sell, and store groundnut to maximize profits. The cooperative purchases raw groundnuts (input commodity) from its member-farmers, which is then processed to obtain multiple grades of groundnut seeds (output commodity). After the processing, two grades may be blended to obtain an intermediate grade to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. The cooperative then sells some or all the output commodity in the spot market and carries the remaining inventory to the following period. It faces the problem of determining the quantity of input commodity to process and the quantity of different grades of output commodity to blend and, subsequently, sell in every period. The novel features of the problem are that the supply of input commodity is random every period, which is caused by the obligation of the cooperative to purchase all the supply that its members bring, and the option to blend grades to create intermediate ones. The possibility of blending over a multi-period planning horizon has not been examined yet in the operations management literature on commodities. We formulate the problem as a dynamic program over a harvest season and use the associated framework to identify structural properties of the optimal value function and optimal decisions. We show that the optimal value function is not separable in the input inventory and the output inventory vector. This makes the identification of the optimal solution challenging. In special cases, the value function may have a simpler form, for example, when blending is not permitted. We develop an efficient procedure to compute the optimal decisions in the general case. We illustrate the benefits of blending and using a multi-period model, employing data obtained from a cooperative: the net profit of the cooperative could improve by 100-900% depending upon the model parameters, which translates to Indian National Rupees 1.94-17.46 million per annum.</content>

    <title>Undiversity, Inequity, and Exclusion in Supply Chains: The Unintended Fallout of Economic Sanctions and Consumer Boycotts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economic sanctions and consumer boycotts are common tools to punish organizations for undesirable behavior and attempt to coerce them to change their actions. However, these tools occasionally spill over beyond the intended recipients and affect guiltless supply chain members, jeopardizing the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion in supply chains. This study identifies four channels through which sanctions and boycotts propagate through supply chains. In particular, supply chain members can be affected by direct relationships with targeted organizations, disruptions in accessing foreign markets, inability to access technology, and logistics failures. Potential solutions include mapping supply chains, proactive cooperation, network analysis, and shortening supply chains. While the work provides a general framework for research and practitioners, it also identifies areas for further studies, such as the role of new technologies and the effect of sanctions and boycotts on supply chain sustainability.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Protecting Workers from Rude Customers to Enhance Organizational Identification in Emotional Labor Environments: a Study with Call Center Agents</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Challenges faced by call centers in managing capacity, efficiency, service speed and quality, training, emotional labor, and turnover are intrinsically intertwined. Call center agents are considered frontline workers, and as such, they often deal with hostile behavior from rude customers. However, they are expected to suppress their feelings and maintain a courteous demeanor despite rude customer behavior, which results in emotional dissonance. Such working environments, where the frontline workers experience emotional dissonance, are termed emotional labor environments. Emotional dissonance, if sustained over a long period of time, can lead to an erosion of organizational identification (OID) amongst agents, unless they perceive adequate protection and support from the management. A low OID can lead to high employee turnover, which in turn results in high recruitment and training costs as well as loss of experience and compromised service quality. In this study, we examine how employee protection policies and leadership style manifest in mitigating the erosion of OID. We develop a research framework to understand the mediating role of agents' perception of the efficacy of the firm's policies to protect them from rude customers and the relevant aspects of the servant leadership style of supervisors in mitigating the erosion of agents' OID caused by the cumulative emotional dissonance over their tenure duration. For this study, we partner with a major multinational firm in Korea in the insurance industry. We find that the perceived organizational support for protection from rude customers and supervisors' servant leadership style are positively related to agents' OID. The agent's OIDdecreaseswith their tenure duration, unless mediated by the agent's perception of the efficacy of protection from rude customers. We provide insights for the retention of agents with implications for capacity and service quality for the call centers. These insights may be extended to frontline workers in other emotional labor environments.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Strategizing Value-Added Services for Platform Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Platform firms are increasingly investing in value-added services (VAS), believing these investments in VAS universally contribute to their success. Although many studies have examined platform firms’ core services (e.g., intermediation), systematic analyses of VAS provision strategies remain limited. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretic model to analyze (1) the conditions under which platform firms benefit from providing VAS and (2) to which side(s) platform firms should provide VAS. We offer several insights. First, variable service costs are a critical yet previously neglected factor in governing platform firms’ VAS provision. Second, a comparison of equilibrium outcomes across three VAS provision strategies—one-sided unidirectional, two separate unidirectional, and bidirectional—reveals that the optimal strategy is jointly determined by variable service costs, cross-network externalities, and the asymmetry in the benefits of bidirectional VAS to the two platform sides. Specifically, when asymmetry is low, bidirectional VAS is optimal. When asymmetry is high, platform firms should provide unidirectional VAS to one side, considering the second side only when variable service costs are low or cross-network externalities are significant. Third, we explore the implications of VAS provision strategies for platform firms’ investment and pricing decisions. For example, when platform firms provide two separate unidirectional VAS, these investments are complementary. VAS could incentivize platform firms to offer price subsidies to one side of the platform. Finally, optimal VAS provision strategies do not always increase consumer surplus.</content>

    <title>Rationally Trust, but Emotionally? The Roles of Cognitive and Affective Trust in Laypeople's Acceptance of AI for Preventive Care Operations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare operations. Nevertheless, particularly in the context of preventive care, little is known about how laypeople perceive and accept AI and change their behavior accordingly. Grounded in a solid theoretical framework of trust, this study bridges this gap by exploring individuals’ acceptance of AI‐based preventive health interventions and following health behavior change, which is critical for preventive care providers’ operational and business performance. Through a randomized field experiment with 15,000 users of a mobile health app complemented by a survey, we first show that the use and disclosure of AI in preventive health interventions improve their effectiveness. However, individuals are less likely to accept and achieve the health behavior change suggested by AI than when they receive similar interventions from health experts. We also observe that the effectiveness of AI‐based interventions can be improved by combining them with human expert opinions, increasing their algorithmic transparency, or emphasizing their genuine care and warmth. These results collectively suggest that, different from conventional technologies, AI's deficient affective trust, rather than comparable cognitive trust, play a decisive role in the acceptance of AI‐based preventive health interventions. This study sheds light on the literature on the role of new‐age information technologies in behavioral operations management, consumer marketing, and healthcare as well as the role of trust in technology acceptance. Valuable practical implications for more effective management of AI for preventive care operations and promotion of consumers’ health behavior are also provided.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Political Uncertainty and the Timing of Mass Layoffs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the relation between political uncertainty arising from state-level election cycles and the timing of employee dismissal and plant closure notices filed by U.S. firms under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act of 1988 (hereafter, WARN notices). We appeal to a real options framework to predict that firms delay layoff decisions and the issuance of WARN notices until the resolution of political uncertainty. Using establishment-level data on layoffs disclosed in WARN notices and state elections occurring between 1994 and 2022, we document that the likelihood of issuing WARN notices declines during the election quarter but increases in the subsequent quarter. Cross-sectional findings show that political uncertainty plays a significant role in the timing of WARN notices during election periods while other factors, including partisanship, economic conditions, union strength, and firm visibility, may also play a role. Further, firms that delay WARN notices do not experience a significant deterioration in their medium-term financial performance. Overall, our findings provide evidence that firms delay labor adjustment decisions and the announcements of such decisions in response to political uncertainty.</content>

    <title>B2B Online Sales Pushes: Whether, When, and Why They Enhance Sales Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Business‐to‐business (B2B) sellers are increasingly transitioning to hybrid sales structures, by augmenting an in‐person field sales force with a direct online channel. During this transition, sellers frequently experience a cold‐start problem, wherein existing customers are either not acquainted with the online channel or unconvinced of its usefulness and are therefore reluctant to adopt it. To overcome the cold‐start problem, B2B sellers are increasingly relying ononline sales pushes, which are efforts to encourage salespeople to nudge customers to adopt the online channel for certain buying tasks. Yet, because salespeople may fear that the online channel adoption jeopardizes the very relationships that they painstakingly built, the salespeople's compliance with an online sales push remains unclear. To glean insight into this dilemma, we empirically investigate an online sales push's impact on salesperson effort (re)allocation and sales performance. Based on an econometric analysis of archival data from a B2B seller and a scenario‐based experiment, we conclude that salespeople generally tend to comply with an online sales push because it frees up their time and allows them to pursue new selling opportunities that have the potential to increase their compensation. The results also indicate that following an online sales push, salespeople expend their effort based on a customer's online proclivity and potential prior to the push. Moreover, the effort expended varies over time and across communication channels. Additionally, the analysis reveals (a) asymmetric carryover and cross‐channel effects of communication effort and sales performance and (b) asymmetric synergistic effects of communication effort on sales performance.</content>

    <title>Analytics for IoT‐Enabled Human–Robot Hybrid Sortation: An Online Optimization Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by a realworld practice of a China Post sortation center, this study considers the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) technology to improve the efficiency of a human–robot hybrid sortation system. In this system, IoT technology enables responsive adjustment of the manual capacity to alleviate the congestion effect of increasing parcel flow on robotic sorting efficiency. We begin with a predictive analysis of a real‐life dataset to quantify the congestion effect on robotic sorting efficiency, and examine the nonstationary behavior of the parcel flow process. Subsequently, we design an online algorithm using IoT advance information (which refers to advance observation of some parcel flows before their actual arrivals) for efficiently adjusting the manual capacity. We develop theoretical guarantee for the effectiveness of the online algorithm by bounding its regret, and also demonstrate that the long‐term expected regret rate is zero under mild conditions. Via extensive simulation experiments, we find that our online algorithm outperforms the China Post sortation center's current policy and conventional Markov dynamic program in terms of computational efficiency and solution quality. The simulation results also demonstrate that the value of IoT technology to the sortation center can be significant, and shed insights on IoT investment by revealing the diminishing return of expanding the horizon of IoT advance information.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the emerging mixed autonomous paradigm in cobotic order picking operations, we investigate the optimal information design to navigate human workers (HWs) who cooperate with autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) within an intralogistics system. We incorporate asymmetric information between AMRs and HWs in a routing game where connected AMRs are informed of the congestion state while HWs rely on information provided by the system. The system designs a communication policy aiming to navigate HWs away from congestion. Without strategic communications, we show that the deployment of AMRs cannot mitigate congestion unless the automation level reaches a threshold. Interestingly, we illustrate a substitution effect between automation and strategic communications when information distortion is mild. In contrast, severe information distortion complements automation due to exacerbated congestion. Furthermore, an in‐house AMR fleet is economically more efficient than a third‐party logistics service. Consequently, in‐house automation can be achieved with mild information distortion, while severe information distortion is required to complement the lack of efficiency in the third‐party AMR fleet. With simulated numerical examples to complement the analytical results, we provide managerial insights concerning the optimal information policies under different levels of automation, guiding warehouse managers in their communications with workers to achieve the best performance of the cobotic system.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Manufacturer’s Role in Nanostore-Supermarket Supply Chain Competition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore retail supply chains in emerging markets in which a manufacturer can reach consumers by selling its product through very small independent stores (nanostores) and/or through a supermarket. Nanostores offer consumers the advantage of proximity, but supermarkets offer the advantage of bulk buying. We explore the competition between the supermarket and nanostores and examine the manufacturer’s role in shaping the retail market structure for its product through wholesale price contracts. We model and analyze a multi-party supply-chain game in which a manufacturer can sell its product to spatially-distributed, utility-maximizing, price-sensitive consumers through nanostores and a supermarket. Consumers can buy in bulk at the supermarket, optimizing their purchase quantity, and hence visit frequency, in an Economic Order Quantity type approach, or they can purchase from a nanostore (frequently due to store storage-space limitations). We fully solve for the equilibrium market structure and the associated retail and wholesale prices, establishing that the manufacturer’s desired channel strategy is governed by three factors: the manufacturer-nanostore supply chain cost, the manufacturer-supermarket supply chain cost, and the supermarket bargaining power. If the supply chain efficiencies are somewhat similar, then the manufacturer should (typically, but not always) use both retail formats to avail of the nanostore advantage in serving proximate consumers and the supermarket advantage in serving distant customers. The specifics of how the manufacturer should use the retail formats will depend on the supermarket power. Among other results, we establish that aggregate nanostore demand and profit can decrease in nanostore density and that the presence of a high-power supermarket can increase consumer surplus because the manufacturer induces strong price competition.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media users generate a variety of content that can potentially influence their followers’ behaviors and preferences. However, most user-generated content, such as text and images, is unstructured, making it difficult to analyze how individuals impact the creation of such data as existing models primarily focus on the numerical aspects of behavioral data. In this paper, we propose a method to identify influential users who significantly affect others’ interest in content topics, with a specific focus on text and images. Our study introduces a new variant of the topic model, incorporating a hierarchical structure and a vector auto-regressive approach. This method accounts for both the evolution of topic distribution and the social influence among users on their interest in content topics. The empirical application of our model to image-sharing social media data demonstrates that our model outperforms conventional topic models in terms of predictive accuracy and topic interpretability. Moreover, we illustrate how visualizing the estimated social influence within the network can provide valuable insights for seeded marketing campaigns and data-driven product development by identifying influential users in various content areas. This approach also offers a deeper understanding of evolving trends in content, preferences, and demand.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper summarizes emerging practice and research issues in the health insurance industry. We provide an industry overview, epitomize business analytics applications, and outline current and emerging problems of interest to key stakeholders and researchers in information systems, operations management, and healthcare management. Specifically, we focus on three areas of research that are of importance to the health insurance industry as well as the healthcare system: (i) management and evaluation of intervention programs, (ii) creation of effective provider networks, and (iii) emerging issues such as the impact of a pandemic, patient communication and steering, and technological innovations in health care. We lay out brief details of how each of these problems can be formulated, where the data can be acquired (public and/or proprietary data sets), and provide guidance for solving them. For several of these problems, we provide models that span causal modeling, predictive modeling, and prescriptive modeling.</content>

    <title>Shaping Ecosystem Rules: Complementarities, Interdependencies, and Firms’ Success in Coordinating Ecosystems Via Standard-Setting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In ecosystems characterized by distributed authority, each firm competes with others to shape the ecosystem’s rules to its advantage while navigating complex interorganizational interdependencies. This creates a coordination problem best exemplified within consensus standards-setting organizations, where different firms present technical proposals and attempt to shape the specifications that dictate how the ecosystem’s technological components must work together. In this paper, we examine what factors determine a firm’s shaping success in such contexts by integrating two major perspectives, one rooted in interfirm social relations and the other that views an ecosystem as a structure of technological interdependence. In so doing, we identify a socio-technical trade-off between the extent of a firm’s relational influence and its efforts to shape core technical proposals (i.e., those that affect many interdependent ecosystem components). A firm with many existing relational ties holds influence that increases its success at shaping, but if such a firm’s proposals are at the core, some of its partners will invariably face high adjustment costs because of the proposal’s wide-ranging impact. Interestingly, a firm with greater prospects for engaging with future complementary partners does not face this trade-off and indeed benefits from shaping at the core. Additionally, value capture considerations also affect how other firms weigh these socio-technical trade-offs, with support for the firm’s shaping attempts dampened among potential future complementors but strengthened among current partners. We provide evidence for these arguments by applying machine-learning techniques on fine-grained data from two prominent wireless telecommunications standards. Our work brings a fresh perspective to a growing ecosystems literature by illuminating both social and technological factors that affect firms’ shaping success.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.16136 .</content>

    <title>Take Me Home, Country Roads: Return Migration and Platform-Enabled Entrepreneurship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the rise of digital platforms that connect rural entrepreneurs to urban customers, rural online businesses are hampered by a lack of talent. Some have pointed to the potentially enabling role of rural returnees. However, although international returnees bring valuable knowledge to businesses in their home countries, it is unclear how domestic returnees affect entrepreneurship in rural, underdeveloped parts of their country. We study this question using a natural experiment involving a regional policy change, which reduced the barriers for rural migrants to return home in one Chinese province but not in others. We find that, after the policy change, rural e-commerce businesses in the province that implemented the policy change enjoyed a 19% performance gain relative to those in other provinces. We theorize and test four mechanisms that may underlie the relationship between return migration and online entrepreneurship: knowledge transfer, demand spillover, de novo businesses, and financial support from returnees. Our results support the knowledge transfer mechanism, but we also find evidence of demand spillover. This study highlights the salience of return mobility and “return barriers” in shaping local entrepreneurship. It also suggests a novel approach toward fostering entrepreneurship in underdeveloped regions: policymakers and digital platforms may work together to pave the country roads that take people home.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2021.16002 .</content>

    <title>Revisiting the CEO Effect Through a Machine Learning Lens</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An important debated topic in strategic management concerns the so-called “chief executive officer (CEO) effect,” which quantifies the impact that CEOs have on the performance of the firms that they lead. Prior literature has empirically investigated the CEO effect and found support for both theses: a significant effect and no effect at all. We note, however, that virtually all prior studies have relied on an empirical specification that leverages in-sample data, which could be unreliable in certain circumstances. In this paper, we utilize machine learning models and predictive analytics based on out-of-sample data to revisit the CEO effect. In particular, we operationalize the CEO effect as the gain in the out-of-sample predictive accuracy by adding the CEO information to the model input in addition to the firm information. By analyzing 1,245 firms and 1,779 CEOs over 20 years, we demonstrate that the results of the approach from the literature have limited external validity. More specifically, we convey that the analyses are purely based on in-sample data and that the predictive effects of CEOs are not substantive when out-of-sample test data sets are used. Although our main analysis relies on optimized distributed gradient boosting, we also conduct extensive robustness tests spanning close to 100 models with alternative algorithms and specifications, all of which yield consistent results.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03625 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: How Awe in Marketing Communications Decreases Consumer Preferences for Limited Edition Products</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Awe is commonly employed in marketing communications given its powerful ability to inspire consumers. Despite the prevalent use of awe in advertising limited edition (LE) products, research has yet to examine when and how awe can benefit or hurt these promotional efforts. Findings across nine studies demonstrate that awe typically has a negative impact on consumer engagement and product preferences toward LE items. This effect results from the reduced desire for exclusivity that a consumer has when experiencing awe. These findings are generalized to several contexts, including a field study of persuasive communications and consumer choices in a metaverse environment. However, awe can enhance consumer preferences toward LE products when promotional messages are framed to reduce this incongruence. We provide insights for marketers on the conditions under which incorporating awe in LE product campaigns might prove beneficial or counterproductive.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Artificial Intelligence on Call: The Physician's Decision of Whether to Use AI in Clinical Practice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Physicians are increasingly able to use artificial intelligence (AI) systems to aid their medical decision-making. This paper examines a physician’s decision regarding whether to use an assistive AI system when prescribing a treatment plan for a patient. Using AI helps the physician generate an informative signal that lessens clinical uncertainty. It can also change the physician’s legal liability in the event of patient harm. We analyze two patient-protection schemes that determine physician liability when using AI: the prevailing patient-protection scheme uses the AI signal to enforce the current standard of care, whereas an emerging scheme proposes using the AI signal as the new standard of care. We show that in both schemes, the physician has an incentive to use AI in low-uncertainty scenarios, even if AI provides little value. Furthermore, the physician may avoid using AI in higher-uncertainty scenarios where AI could have aided in better decision-making. As AI becomes more precise, the physician may become more hesitant to use it on certain patients. A comparison of the physician’s decision to use AI under the two schemes reveals that using the AI signal as the new standard of care may mitigate AI underuse (overuse) for certain patients but may boost AI underuse (overuse) for some other patients.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Strategic Change Capability in Marketing Organizations: Conceptualization, Scale Development, and Validation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In dynamic and uncertain business environments, marketing organizations need to be constantly ready to enact strategic changes. However, a robust measure for capturing the organizational capabilities and underlying marketing activities required to achieve effective marketing-related strategic changes is lacking. This study addresses this gap by developing a measurement tool for strategic change capability (SCC). Drawing on interviews with marketing consultants and senior marketing managers, the authors conceptualize SCC as a multidimensional dynamic marketing capability that comprises five dimensions: establishing the business case for change, preparing employees for change, setting up the organization for implementing change, institutionalizing change, and assessing and adjusting implementation. Following rigorous scale development procedures, including (1) item generation, (2) expert evaluation, (3) scale purification, (4) scale validity, (5) nomological and predictive validity, and (6) scale generalizability studies, a psychometrically sound and reliable measure of SCC is developed. The SCC scale facilitates different types of strategic marketing change and predicts performance outcomes better than established constructs (i.e., strategic flexibility, agility, adaptiveness, and responsiveness). This study contributes to the dynamic capabilities theory and provides empirically substantiated guidance for marketing organizations on how to prepare for and effectively enact strategic changes in dynamic business environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The sharing economy has become an increasingly widespread way for peers to rent out their owned goods to others seeking to rent them. This research investigates how providers (i.e., owners renting out their belongings) decide what price to charge, and identifies theprovider WTA effect, where in the context of a peer-to-peer (P2P) collaborative consumption model, providers are willing to accept (WTA)lessthan renters (i.e., non-owners) are willing to pay (WTP). These findings diverge from prior research which has repeatedly demonstrated that owners typically demand more to part with their belongings than non-owners are willing to pay in a seller/buyer transaction (i.e., the endowment effect). Theprovider WTA effectis explained by providers having a more accessible empathy lens which in turn acts to dampen the accessibility of their exchange lens when renting out their item. This drives WTA below WTP. The effect is moderated when the renter is identified as a dissimilar transaction partner. This research provides actionable implications for providers and platforms.</content>

    <title>Do the People Make the Place? A 40-Year Review of Research on ASA Theory</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Attraction-selection-attrition (ASA) theory proposes that “the people make the place” and has served as a foundation for many areas of organizational research. In this review, we take stock of the ASA literature to identify what we know and what we need to know about ASA processes and their effects on organizations. Based on a review of over 6,000 articles that cited ASA, we identified 321 studies that used the theory as a basis for their hypotheses. However, only 77 (24%) of those studies actually tested an aspect of the theory. For example, although ASA is an organizational-level theory, most studies used the theory to test phenomena at other levels, such as individuals, teams, or occupations. Among studies that did test the theory, very few directly assessed its core hypotheses. For instance, only one published study directly tested the central hypothesis that ASA processes lead to homogeneity. Moreover, some parts of the theory were not supported. As an example, although the theory suggests that ASA processes will reduce organizational effectiveness, several studies found that homogeneity was associated with better performance. Although the amount of empirical support for ASA theory was uneven, we believe it still has the potential to help understand organizations and the people that make them. To that end, we provide an agenda for future research that prioritizes how to best test ASA’s core hypotheses. We also highlight connections between ASA and other theories and literatures that examine similar phenomena to inspire future research opportunities.</content>

    <title>Organizational-Level Training and Performance: A Meta-Analytic Investigation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While extensive research has examined the relationship between human resource management systems and organizational performance, the impact of organizational-level training—defined as the quantity and quality of training that an organization provides to its employees—remains less understood. In this article, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relationship between organizational-level training and organizational performance to determine the magnitude of the relationship and test a set of moderators of the relationship. Grounded in human capital theory, our meta-analysis employs a theoretically driven moderator analysis to identify the conditions under which organizational-level training significantly influences organizational performance. The results from 159 studies (N = 75,033) show that the relationship between organizational-level training and organizational performance is positive and significant (ρ= .13, SDρ= .17, 95% CI [.11, .16]). More importantly, the effect size differs significantly across several theoretical (e.g., training dimensions, type of human capital, outcome dimensions, and timing of measurement) and contextual (e.g., industry knowledge intensity, firm age, and region) moderators. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.</content>

    <title>Offshore Shared Services Center Usage by U.S. Big 4 Audit Engagement Teams</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Auditors frequently outsource audit work to offshore Shared Service Centers (SSCs) to reduce costs and ease the workload burdens of audit team members. However, concerns persist about whether these benefits come at the expense of audit quality. Using proprietary audit engagement‐level data, I evaluate whether greater SSC usage by Big 4 audit teams has an association with either, or both, audit quality and audit costs. I find that SSC usage is nearly universal in Big 4 audits, with the percentage of audit hours SSCs perform increasing in recent years. Consistent with the audit firm's objectives, evidence suggests that SSC usage is associated with fewer audit hours and lower audit fees. Importantly, I find no evidence that SSC usage is associated with lower audit quality. Overall, results suggest that SSCs have the intended effect of reducing audit costs without sacrificing audit quality.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores implications of weak identification in common ‘long memory’ and recent ‘rough’ approaches to modeling volatility dynamics of financial assets. We unveil an asymptotic near-observational equivalence between a long memory model with weak autoregressive dynamics and a rough model with a near-unit autoregressive root. Standard methods struggle to distinguish them, and conventional asymptotics are invalid. We propose an identication-robust approach to construct condence sets that reveal the uncertainty and aid inference. Empirical studies based on realized volatility and trading volume often fail to statistically reject either model, thereby providing evidence of their potential coexistence.

    <title>The green sin: how exchange rate volatility and financial openness affect green premia</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a model with mean-variance foreign investors who exhibit a convex disutility associated to brown bond holdings. The model predicts that bond green premia should be smaller in economies with more closed financial accounts and highly volatile exchange rates. This happens because foreign intermediaries invest relatively less in such economies, and this lowers the marginal disutility of investing in polluting activities. We find strong empirical evidence in favor of this hypothesis using a global bond market dataset. Exchange rate volatility and financial account openness are thus able to explain the higher financing costs of green projects in emerging markets relative to advanced economies, especially when green bonds are denominated in local currency: a disadvantage that we can call the “green sin” of emerging economies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the adoption of Central Bank digital currency (CBDC) in a partial equilibrium setting, focusing on four key features: remuneration, monetary incentives, interoperability, and architecture. Agents are interested in adopting CBDC because they have a preference for digital payments, and the Central Bank may incentivize adoption through subsidies and platform development, potentially in collaboration with the private sector. Our results demonstrate that both the remuneration scheme and monetary incentives significantly influence the adoption rate and transaction volume. Calibrating the model for the digital euro case study, we show that the target of 60% of the population using CBDC can be achieved, provided that platform productivity is substantially enhanced. Although this target is feasible within a one-layer architecture, it becomes significantly more challenging in a two-layer setting. CBDC is likely to win the adoption battle against stablecoins but is likely to lose it against debit cards.This paper has been This paper was accepted by Will Cong for the Special Issue on Digital Finance.Funding: This project has been partially funded by the European Union – Next Generation EU – PNRR project SERICS “Security and Rights in the CyberSpace” (PE00000014 – CUP B53C22003990006) – SPOKE 9.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01504 .</content>

    <title>Intentionality and Attentionality Dynamics in an Institutional Change Process</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article, we explore how actors' intentionality emerges, develops, and co‐evolves with institutional change. Although intentions are essential in shaping institutional change agents' motivations and actions, our understanding of their dynamics is limited and biased by the assumption that intentions are usually identifiable prior to institutional change. Building on the works of philosophers, in particular Husserl's life exploration of consciousness and intentions, we argue that a more effective way to conceptualize intentionality in institutional change is to consider attentionality, that is, how actors direct their mental focus toward specific elements of their social reality. Empirically, we draw upon a phenomenon‐driven study of the Algerian agricultural transformation from 2000 to 2019, with a focus on the contributions of Benamor, a leading agri‐food business. We theorize a process model that differentiates between passive and active intentions. Passive intentions are virtual mental possibilities upon which active intentions are built to instigate change. Our findings highlight attentional conversion as a crucial mechanism that drives the transition from passive to active intentions. These findings have important implications for our understanding of institutional change theories.</content>

    <title>Most Read Versus Most Shared: How Less (vs. More) Social Popularity Labels Influence News Media Consumption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;News outlets commonly highlight the most popular content using different labels (e.g., “most read” and “most shared”). As prior research has found that people primarily consume news for information or entertainment, it is important to understand what these popularity labels convey about the information value and entertainment value of articles and how they shape consumers’ news preferences and decisions. Nine lab and field studies, including two in the web appendix, demonstrate that labels reflecting less social behavior (e.g., “most read”) signal higher information (vs. entertainment) value, while labels reflecting more social behavior (e.g., “most shared”) signal higher entertainment (vs. information) value. Thus, consumers with information motives prefer less social popularity labels, a stronger signal of information value. Conversely, consumers with entertainment motives prefer more social labels, a stronger signal of entertainment value. Notably, an analysis of 120 major media outlets revealed that many use labels that are misaligned with readers’ dominant motives or use no label at all, indicating considerable room for improvement. Reassuringly, this work finds that strategically using popularity labels can increase clicks by over 20%. This has implications for media outlets aiming to spur engagement as well as researchers and organizations concerned with information dissemination.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In light of recent social and political movements advocating for racial equity and calls for more research on interracial marketplace interactions, this research explores the role racial identity plays in the consumption domain. Specifically, we investigate the marketplace consequences of U.S.-based White consumers’ feelings about their own racial identity by measuring and manipulating white guilt, defined as the sense of guilt and remorse that emerges among White consumers who hold their racial ingroup responsible for historical and ongoing racial injustices and perceive that Whites, as a racial group, benefit from unearned privileges. Consistent with the reparation-oriented action profile of guilt, six studies (all pre-registered, two with incentive-compatible designs) show that white guilt motivates reparative behaviors toward Black-owned businesses in various service contexts: Consumers with high white guilt express greater willingness to patronize and promote a business when it is Black-owned (vs. White-owned, family-owned, or when there is no information on ownership) and feel more moral for doing so, whereas this effect is non-existent, or sometimes reversed, for those low in white guilt. Our findings reveal the complex dynamics of race, identity, and intergroup relations in the marketplace, and demonstrate a contemporary exception to ingroup favoritism among some White consumers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Shuang Ma, Lin Ge, Michael Jia, Yonggui WangIn recent years, the use of service robots in the lodging, dining, and retail sectors has become more prevalent. Service robots offer various benefits, such as reducing operational costs, improving service efficiency, enabling 24-hour support, and ensuring consistent service quality. However, our research indicates that service firms do not uniformly benefit from service robot deployment across all service settings. Specifically, we show that customers’ relative preference for service robots over human service providers is lower in luxury services than in mainstream services. We call it the robot disadvantage in luxury services. This disadvantage arises because service robots—as nonhuman service providers—cannot make customers feel that they are being served as a prestigious customer of superior social status over service providers. To address this challenge, we propose two effective strategies for luxury service firms. First, luxury service firms may emphasize the concept of social equality in their communications. Second, luxury service firms may frame the use of service robots as an exclusive privilege. Both approaches can mitigate customers’ resistance to robots in luxury services.</content>

    <title>How to Sample and When to Stop Sampling: The Generalized Wald Problem and Minimax Policies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study sequential experiments where sampling is costly and a decision-maker aims to determine the best treatment for full scale implementation by (1) adaptively allocating units between two possible treatments, and (2) stopping the experiment when the expected welfare (inclusive of sampling costs) from implementing the chosen treatment is maximized. Working under a continuous time limit, we characterize the optimal policies under the minimax regret criterion. We show that the same policies also remain optimal under both parametric and non-parametric outcome distributions in an asymptotic regime where sampling costs approach zero. The minimax optimal sampling rule is just the Neyman allocation: it is independent of sampling costs and does not adapt to observed outcomes. The decision-maker halts sampling when the product of the average treatment difference and the number of observations surpasses a specific threshold. The results derived also apply to the so-called best-arm identification problem, where the number of observations is exogenously specified.</content>

    <title>The US, Economic News, and the Global Financial Cycle</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide evidence for a causal link between the US economy and the global financial cycle. Using intraday data, we show that US macroeconomic news releases have large and significant effects on global risky asset prices. Stock price indexes of 27 countries, the VIX, and commodity prices all jump instantaneously upon news releases. The responses of stock indexes co-move across countries and are large—often comparable in size to the response of the S&amp;P 500. Further, US macroeconomic news explains on average 23 percent of the quarterly variation in foreign stock markets. The joint behavior of stock prices, bond yields, and risk premia suggests that systematic US monetary policy reactions to news do not drive the estimated effects. Instead, the evidence points to a direct effect on investors’ risk-taking capacity. Our findings show that a byproduct of the United States’ central position in the global financial system is that news about its business cycle has large effects on global financial conditions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We conduct a descriptive analysis of performance of disciplines, journals, authors, and universities based on number of publications in fifty business and economics journals represented in the Financial Times list (FT 50) from 2008-2022 using data from the Web of Science. We analyze more than 55,000 papers published by more than 54,000 unique authors during this period to document four sets of findings. First, our analysis suggests that Operations Management and Multidisciplinary areas experienced significant publication growth from 2008 to 2022, increasing their publication and citation share in FT 50 journals, even after accounting for the relative handicap in terms of number of journals in the FT 50 list. Second, the growth in publications of the Operations Management discipline is driven by significant growth inProduction and Operations ManagementandManufacturing and Service Operations Management. Notably, theJournal of Business Ethicsalone published nearly 10% of the papers published in the FT 50 list, more than the number of papers published by the five disciplines each: Accounting, Marketing, Multidisciplinary, Operations Management, and Information Systems. Third, we find that the most prolific authors in Management and Organizations, Operations Management, Economics, and Marketing had a higher number of publications during the 2008-2022 period than the most prolific authors of other disciplines. Finally, our analyses of the most prolific 150 worldwide universities published in the FT 50 list suggest that the list is dominated mostly by about a dozen countries that include North American countries (USA and Canada), European countries (Netherlands, Germany, UK, France, and Spain), China (including Hong Kong), Australia, and Singapore. We discuss the implications of our findings for ranking organizations, editors, academic associations, individual scientists, administrators, and policymakers.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Self-driving Technology and Its Acceptance: Explaining Differences in Reactions of the Heterogeneous Population to Potential Policies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Self-driving cars have the potential to drastically reduce accidents caused by human errors, saving significant amounts of money in damages as well as human lives. However, public acceptance of the technology operating on public roads still needs to improve, as most Americans are uncomfortable sharing the road with a self-driving car. The challenge for policymakers is to craft regulations that not only enhance the safety of self-driving technology but also foster public trust and acceptance. This study examines how specific policies—requiring visual cues to indicate when a vehicle is operating in self-driving mode and certification requirements for users—impact public acceptance of self-driving cars. To evaluate the impact of the policies, we theorize how policies may influence people’s trust and how trust, in turn, may affect acceptance of technology. Furthermore, we examine how these effects vary across political affiliations, as prior research suggests that Republicans and Democrats differ in their trust in government oversight and technological innovation. Our findings confirm that Republicans are generally less willing to share the road with self-driving vehicles than Democrats, largely due to lower trust in the government to regulate the technology effectively. We find that a visual cue policy increases trust in government but decreases trust in the technology, leading to increased acceptance among Republicans but a neutral or negative effect for Democrats. Conversely, a certification requirement increases trust in government and in other drivers, positively impacting acceptance for both Republicans and Democrats. Finally, additional analysis revealed that a combined policy implementing both measures proves to be the most effective at increasing overall public acceptance by strengthening trust across multiple dimensions. These insights provide valuable guidance for policymakers seeking to improve the integration of self-driving cars into public roadways.</content>

    <title>The Art of Misspelling: Unraveling the Diverging Effects of Misspelled Brand Names on Consumer Responses</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Linguistic characteristics influence how consumers recognize and associate with brands. Although recent research shows the negative impact of misspellings in brand names on sincerity and brand attitudes, many brands successfully use this strategy to create unique brand identities. We argue that not all misspellings have the same negative impact and thus explore how consumers process brand names through both linguistic and conceptual fluency. In a series of six experiments, we present and examine a typology of misspellings and their differential impact on fluency and resulting consumer attitudes, inferences, and behavioral intentions. This typology of brand name misspellings provides a practical framework guiding brand naming strategy. We demonstrate that minor misspellings can be just as effective as correct spellings. More severe misspellings can also be effective if consumers perceive them as relevant. The findings reveal how managers can reap the benefits of misspelling, such as memorability, uniqueness, or trademark acquisition, and avoid the overall negative effects.</content>

    <title>Framing of Seeker-Generated Information and New Solver Participation in Open Innovation Contests: An Empirical Analysis of the Temporal Effects</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In today’s highly competitive global market, firms recognize innovation as a key driver of success. To foster innovation, firms (or seekers) increasingly leverage open innovation contests to engage external solvers in addressing challenges. These contests are dynamic, allowing new solvers to enter at any point before the deadline, with their participation influenced by seeker-generated information (SGI), including contest descriptions, clarifications to solvers’ questions, and solution reviews. When communicating requirements, firms can frame SGI by specifying the extent of preference disclosure and defining boundaries for unacceptable design elements. This study examines how SGI framing impacts new solver entry and how its effects evolve as the contest progresses. Using a comprehensive data set from an open innovation contest platform, we find that extensive preference disclosure attracts more new solvers daily, with its effect intensifying as the deadline approaches. Additionally, clear and precise rejection criteria initially deter but later encourage solver participation as the deadline nears. When the deadline is distant, overly restrictive requirements can overshadow other important factors, such as solvers’ need for exploration, and deter participation. These findings provide actionable insights for firms on how to strategically frame SGI at different contest stages to optimize solver participation in open innovation contests.</content>

    <title>Post-Earnings-Announcement Drift Prediction: Leveraging Postevent Investor Responses with Multitask Learning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Post-earnings-announcement drift (PEAD) remains one of the most persistent market anomalies, yet traditional models struggle to predict it effectively. Prior research has relied on single-task learning (STL), which treats PEAD prediction as an isolated task, overlooking key postevent investor responses—such as analyst forecast revisions and institutional trading—that drive stock price movements. However, incorporating these signals directly as model inputs introduces look-ahead bias, making real-world predictions impractical.Our study proposes a multitask learning (MTL) framework that circumvents this issue by treating postevent investor responses as auxiliary tasks rather than direct inputs. This enables the model to learn from these critical signals without “cheating.” Additionally, we introduce GradPerp, a novel adaptive task weighting method that prioritizes diverse, meaningful training signals, further improving predictive performance.A key insight from our research is that leveraging MTL in real-world contexts requires deep domain knowledge and novel designs. More importantly, our MTL framework opens new opportunities for practitioners to enhance deep learning models by incorporating their financial expertise through carefully chosen auxiliary tasks. Unlike traditional AI models that rely solely on automated feature selection, our approach provides a structured way for investment professionals to embed domain-driven signals into predictive modeling, unlocking new potential in quantitative finance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms strive to improve their products over time to compete effectively in the market. Typically, firms enhance products to stay competitive by adding novel features, imitating competitors, or leveraging customer input through social media. In the case of mobile apps, user feedback in the form of reviews includes suggestions of novel features or features that are already present in competing apps. Leveraging the information contained in reviews and version release notes of iOS apps, we develop a deep learning–based natural language processing approach to identify four types of app features: developer-initiated novel, developer-initiated imitative, user-suggested novel, and user-suggested imitative. We evaluate the impact of these feature categories on app demand. We observe that developer-initiated novel and user-suggested imitative features significantly boost app demand. Conversely, user-suggested novel features can negatively impact demand, especially when they are implemented contextually distant from user suggestions, though contextually close implementations have a positive effect. Although we observe that the aggregate impact of developer-initiated imitative features is insignificant, features that are slightly modified do have a positive effect on demand. The primary contribution of our study is to investigate user reviews as a source of ideas for new features and to evaluate their performance impacts relative to those of developer-initiated features.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managing an older and more age‐diverse workforce is critical given the population aging that is occurring across the globe. Yet, the literature is still under‐developed with regards to which human resource management (HRM) practices help to support aging employees and enable organizations to benefit from an age‐diverse workforce. We draw on an integrative framework of organizational meta‐strategies, the 3i framework, to test a path model in which 3i HRM practices differentially impact successful aging at work outcomes, including engagement, career withdrawal, and proactive career behavior. The 3i framework encompassesinclusivepractices aimed at reducing biases and creating an inclusive climate for workers,individualizedpractices aimed at designing and adapting work to the changing needs of an age‐diverse workforce, andintegrativepractices targeted at effective collaboration and knowledge sharing processes across age groups. We theorized thatincludeinfluences successful aging outcomes through belongingness,individualizethrough needs‐supplies fit, andintegratethrough promotive voice. Prior to testing the model, we first report a study in which we developed and validated the 12‐item 3i‐HRM scale using three diverse samples (totalN= 945) of employees from the USA and Australia. We subsequently used the 3i‐HRM scale to test our theoretical model using a time‐lagged design with 221 employees. By providing this initial evidence, we hope to stimulate future research focusing on an integrative approach to understanding factors that support an age‐diverse workforce.</content>

    <title>Intra‐firm work experiences and corporate venturing by employees: The roles of job specialization and functionally diverse groups</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Taking a strategic human capital perspective on corporate venturing by employees, we consider the potential influence of their job and group experiences within the firm. Because building new ventures requires diverse functional knowledge, greater job specialization could create a barrier to undertaking corporate venturing. However, working in more functionally diverse groups within the firm can facilitate venturing—especially for more specialized employees—by enabling them to develop the skills needed to work with others who have such diverse knowledge. We test our hypotheses using a longitudinal dataset from over 16,000 employees in a large corporation. Our findings advance understanding of the micro‐foundations of internal corporate venturing, how bureaucracies shape corporate entrepreneurship, and how employees can build knowledge and skills with strategic value for the firm.Managerial SummaryWe examine how firms can prepare their employees to undertake corporate venture building activities by shaping their work experiences inside the firm. In a study of employees' work histories within a large corporation, we find that employees who had worked in more functionally diverse groups were more likely to undertake internal corporate venturing. Such experience was particularly important for those who had worked in more specialized jobs, since it could help them collaborate and connect with others with diverse functional knowledge. Our findings suggest that firms hoping to promote strategic growth and increase their competitiveness through corporate venture building consider providing employees with work experiences that help them develop cross‐functional knowledge and skills.</content>

    <title>Founder regulatory focus: Effects on entrepreneurial orientation and venture performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article draws upon regulatory focus theory to examine the ways in which founders influence entrepreneurial orientation and performance in young ventures. Findings from studies of young ventures in Ghana (N= 226) and Kenya (N= 205) suggest that founder promotion focus has a positive effect on entrepreneurial orientation, while founder prevention focus has a negative effect. Furthermore, we find that entrepreneurial orientation mediates the effects of founder regulatory focus on young venture performance and that the strategic decision speed of founders moderates the entrepreneurial orientation—venture performance relationship. The results extend theory on entrepreneurial orientation and regulatory focus by elucidating the role of founders' characteristics in setting an entrepreneurial tone for their firms and enhancing the effects of entrepreneurial orientation on venture performance.Managerial SummaryWith this article, we highlight the roles of regulatory focus and decision speed with entrepreneurial orientation (EO) to suggest the founder is vital in setting an entrepreneurial tone in their organizations. Leaders in young ventures should realize that their dispositions have outsized influence in both the development of EO and how EO is put into action. Founders who recognize the merits of cultivating a promotion‐focused orientation can strategically leverage this orientation to fuel their ventures' EO. Conversely, the negative influence of founder prevention focus on EO signifies the potential challenges associated with risk aversion and loss avoidance in entrepreneurial ventures. Finally, leaders who acknowledge the significance of quick, informed decisions are better positioned to leverage the positive impact of EO on new venture performance.</content>

    <title>Mapping entrepreneurial inclusion across &lt;scp&gt;US&lt;/scp&gt; neighborhoods: The case of low‐code e‐commerce entrepreneurship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurship is presented as a path to prosper through commerce, yet there is evidence that certain communities are underrepresented in entrepreneurship. Technological developments such as low‐code e‐commerce tools have altered the barriers to launch commercial ventures. Do these tools alter entrepreneurial inclusion? We study an omnipresent low‐code tool, Shopify, which has dramatically reduced the financial and technical barriers to e‐commerce. We undertake an abductive analysis using unique data on the spatial distribution of Shopify‐based activity for the entire United States. We find evidence of entrepreneurial inclusion; neighborhoods with more Black residents, a group historically underrepresented in entrepreneurship, also have more low‐code ventures. We interpret these results against traditional forms of startups: newly registered businesses and VC‐backed e‐commerce ventures. These benchmark analyses further support our findings.Managerial SummaryWe consider the impact of recent technological changes that make it easier to start entrepreneurial ventures. We study the spatial uptake of a popular low‐code e‐commerce tool, Shopify, that makes launching and running an online business markedly cheaper and easier. Using data on nearly 160,000 Shopify‐based ventures across the entire United States, we find that usage of Shopify is more prevalent in neighborhoods with more Black residents. The pattern is distinct from that observed for traditional ventures and VC‐backed start‐ups. The evidence suggests low‐code tools represent a novel path to entrepreneurship, enhancing entrepreneurial access and potentially opening previously under‐explored markets. The finding further highlights the role of new tools (e.g., low‐code or AI‐driven) as a possible addition to policies aimed at enhancing entrepreneurial inclusion.</content>

    <title>Blood diamonds? Responses of open‐source software developers to the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica scandal</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Corporate scandals often create moral struggles for ecosystem stakeholders who collaborate with scandal‐tainted firms on mutually beneficial projects. We examine how these stakeholders navigate their relationships with such firms. Drawing on cognitive dissonance theory, we posit that stakeholders typically withdraw from such collaborations after a scandal. However, if stakeholders continue their engagement, they tend to emphasize the importance of collaborative projects and counterintuitively increase their project contribution. Stakeholders' responses depend on their choice space for comparable projects and their social embeddedness in the focal projects. By examining the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica scandal and the contribution of open‐source software (OSS) developers to Facebook projects with a difference‐in‐differences approach, we find supporting evidence for our hypotheses. Our study contributes to the stakeholder management literature with practical implications.Managerial SummaryFirms are increasingly adopting ecosystem strategies and engaging diverse stakeholders for value creation. Managers must therefore consider how to maintain stakeholder engagement when adverse events occur. In this study, we examine the reactions of OSS developers to the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica scandal of 2018. We found that after the scandal, OSS developers with more project choices and less social embeddedness in Facebook projects were more likely to disengage from Facebook. Interestingly, however, developers who continued their engagement with Facebook projects tended to rationalize their continued involvement and surprisingly increased their commitment to those projects. This unusual effect suggests that stakeholder retention not only ameliorates the negative effects of scandals but also has positive outcomes, thus warranting the allocation of extra resources from scandal‐tainted firms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the information content of textual disclosures in firms’ earnings announcements. Using a large language model (LLM) to capture information in both words and word context, I show that the news in earnings press releases (i) explains three times more variation in short-window stock returns than a host of textual measures based on dictionary and non-LLM machine learning methods; (ii) doubles the R2of an array of financial statement surprises, modeled with conventional regression or machine learning approaches; and (iii) accounts for a large fraction of immediate price revisions within just five minutes of release. LLM-modeled conference calls further enhance R2by one fourth compared with press releases and financial surprises. Textual disclosures are more informative when earnings are less persistent and during periods of aggregate uncertainty. Most news arises from text describing numbers, at the beginning of the disclosure, and including novel contents. These findings highlight the role of firms’ textual disclosures in moving stock prices and advance our understanding of how investors utilize corporate disclosures.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: The author gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Naveen Jindal School of Management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05417 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When home prices threaten to decline, large mortgage investors can benefit from fostering new lending that boosts demand. We ask whether this benefit contributed to the growth in acquisitions of risky mortgages by the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) in the first half of 2007. We find that it helps explain the variation of this growth across regions, as well as regional house price and credit changes. The growth predicted by this benefit is on top of the acquisition growth caused by the exit of private-label securitizers. We conclude that the GSEs actively targeted their acquisitions to counter home-price declines.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05912 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Platform-run marketplaces may exploit third-party sellers’ data to develop competing products, but the threat of future competition can deter sellers’ entry. We explore how this trade-off affects the platform’s entry on the marketplace and the referral fee it charges to the third-party sellers. We first characterize the platform’s optimal fee under different degrees of commitment on its own entry policy. We show that full commitment maximizes not only the platform’s payoff but also consumer surplus, as the associated fee induces maximal entry by the sellers. Next, we show how and when the platform’s policy on information sharing between its marketplace and product divisions can substitute for its commitment to entry. We characterize the platform’s optimal information policy and examine how it interacts with the platform’s fee structure. We show that an outright ban on information sharing between the platform’s divisions can reduce consumer welfare as it may lead to a higher referral fee that thwarts sellers’ entry. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the platform’s fee structure as a strategic response in the policy debates on marketplace regulation.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: J.

    <title>Deadline Effect in Stroke Patient Care: A Temporal Motivation Theory Perspective of Process Management</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stroke is a highly time‐sensitive medical emergency, and earlier treatment is crucial. Drawing on Temporal Motivation Theory, we investigate a “deadline effect” in stroke care and analyze how two deadlines, that is, amedically orientedone (administering Tissue Plasminogen Activator, TPA, within 4.5 h of symptom onset) and agoal‐orientedone (the 60‐min in‐hospital target fromTarget:Stroke), shape care consistency. We define a deadline effect as a variable task processing rate under time pressure from a pending task completion deadline, which can cause inconsistent care. Clinicians may work more slowly when patients arrive soon after symptom onset, given ample time remains before the 4.5‐h TPA window. Using an accelerated‐failure‐time model and addressing patient selection bias, we find that shorter onset‐to‐door times correlate with longer door‐to‐needle times, and vice versa, confirming the medically oriented deadline effect. As a result, care time may vary considerably based on how much of the TPA window remains. UnderTarget:Stroke, a goal‐driven national initiative in the United States to improve stroke care quality, stroke teams face an additional 60‐min in‐hospital deadline. Our findings show that the initiative prompts stroke teams to prioritize the tighter goal and maintain a more consistent care pace, regardless of patients' arrival times. Our mechanism analyses reveal two boundary conditions for the main findings: (i) when the downstream time segment ends with a mid‐point patient care milestone rather than the strict TPA administration deadline or (ii) when the system congestion level is high, the main findings do not hold, advancing the deadline effect literature from an operational standpoint. Furthermore, our major findings are robust to other confounding factors and model assumptions, ruling out alternative explanations. Notably, post hoc analyses confirm thatTarget:Strokefosters consistent time performance without adversely affecting other health outcomes, advocating its efficacy. In sum, we highlight the operational implications of multiple deadlines in stroke care, extending the broader deadline effect literature. For hospital clinicians, properly set goals can stabilize care processes and strengthen overall performance, emphasizing the strategic value of well‐designed deadlines in time‐critical healthcare settings.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Long-term growth expectations are central to investment analysis and corporate valuation. Despite a dominant effect on firm value, the academic literature and practitioner conventions provide little guidance on determining this long-term growth rate. This article takes a step in addressing this gap: we estimate the relationship between long-term growth and an extensive selection of firm, industry, and market characteristics. Market prices do not seem to fully capture long-term growth information. Cross sectional tests yield substantial positive abnormal returns for firms with high expected long-term growth.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article proposes and estimates a tractable, arbitrage-free valuation model for corporate coupon bonds that includes a more realistic recovery rate process. Most existing studies use a recovery rate process that is misspecified because it includes recovery for coupons due after default. Misspecification errors from assuming recovery on all coupons can be substantial; they increase with recovery rates, coupons, maturity, and default probabilities. For a large sample of market transactions, i) our model has lower pricing errors than one assuming recovery on all coupons and ii) the magnitude of our model’s outperformance is linked to misspecification errors from assuming recovery on coupons.</content>

    <title>The Lender’s Lender: Trade Credit and the Monitoring Role of Banks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A firm’s role as lender to its customers (via trade credit) is influenced by the firm’s own lenders. With a novel data set of trade credit between U.S. public companies, I find that firms limit customer credit concentrations, extending less generous trade credit to customers as the firms’ sales dependence on them increases. Evidence points to lenders influencing firms to limit credit concentrations: First, cross-sectional variation shows stronger results with greater lender monitoring intensity. Second, analysis of granular loan contract details reveals that concentration limits in borrowing base formulas are a clear, previously unexplored way banks influence trade credit policies.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Poison pills are among the most powerful antitakeover provisions, but studying their economic impact is challenging because of the obvious endogeneity concerns. We address the problem by studying U.S. states’ staggered adoption of poison pill laws (PPLs), which strengthen the right to adopt a pill (i.e., theshadow pill) and increase the validity of visible pills. We document that PPLs make visible pill policy aligned with economic incentives, increasing pill adoption among firms with a high likelihood of takeover, but decreasing it among firms with low takeover likelihood. We also document that PPLs positively impact firm value, especially for innovative firms with more intangible assets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the impact of limited attention on investment decisions by venture capitalists (VCs). I find that startups funded by VCs during VCs’ IPO engagements tend to underperform: These startups are 9% less likely to go public or become acquired and have lower exit multiples. The effects of VCs’ busyness cluster around the active phase of the IPO engagement and are more pronounced in cases of higher workload intensity or higher information asymmetry. Overall, this performance gap induced by attention constraints provides new evidence on VCs’ ability to identify investment opportunities at the initial screening stage.</content>

    <title>Visible Hands: Professional Asset Managers’ Expectations and the Stock Market in China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how professional fund managers’ growth expectations affect their equity investments and the consequent effects on prices. Using novel data on China’s mutual fund managers’ growth expectations, we show that pessimistic managers decrease equity allocations and shift away from more cyclical stocks. We identify a statistically significant link between managers’ growth expectations and returns on the stocks that they hold and trade. We also find that an earnings-based measure of price informativeness is increasing in forecasting managers’ investment and forecast-consistent trading, implying that active fund managers in China help move stock prices closer to underlying fundamentals.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using manually compiled cost of equity (COE) estimates disclosed in takeover regulatory filings, we provide novel evidence on how investment bankers estimate discount rates. COE estimates are related to several risk proxies, such as beta and size. Other firm characteristics are unrelated to COE estimates or provide relations contradicting academic evidence. We also explore the role of incentives. For example, banks use significantly higher COEs in management buyouts, which potentially underestimates target value, making the bid more attractive for target shareholder approval.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The growing popularity of home-sharing platforms such as Airbnb, partly fueled by hosts’ ability to evade local taxes and regulations, has been shown to elevate housing costs by reallocating long-term housing units to the short-term rental market. This study assesses whether enhanced tax enforcement can mitigate this trend. We analyze staggered tax collection agreements between Airbnb and Florida counties, wherein Airbnb collects taxes from the hosts directly. Using a difference-in-differences methodology, we find these agreements significantly slow the growth of housing costs, highlighting the importance of tax policy in addressing the sharing economy’s influence on housing affordability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The dissemination of public information regarding an asset’s fundamental value can encourage the acquisition of private information by informed traders, leading to a crowding-in effect. Competing with the crowding-out effect analyzed in prior research, the crowding-in effect shapes the demand for private information in a hump-shaped curve against public information quality. I examine how a for-profit information seller strategically provides information, exploiting this hump-shaped demand curve, and offer theoretical support for the coexistence of free and paid information. The model yields distinctive insights into the equilibrium information structure and market quality when the crowding-in effect drives public information dissemination.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Recent influential work finds large increases in inequality in the United States based on measures of wealth concentration that notably exclude the value of social insurance programs. This paper shows that top wealth shares have not changed much over the last three decades when Social Security is properly accounted for. This is because Social Security wealth increased substantially from $7.2 trillion in 1989 to $40.6 trillion in 2019 and now represents nearly 50% of the wealth of the bottom 90% of the wealth distribution. This finding is robust to potential changes to taxes and benefits in response to system financing concerns.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate a seller's strategic choice between optimally structured negotiations with fewer bidders and an auction with more competing bidders when payments can have a contingent component, as is common in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), patent licensing, and employee compensation. The key factor favoring negotiations is that it allows the seller to set her preferred payment structure—that is, the revenue‐maximizing mix of cash and contingent pay; reserve prices are of secondary importance. Negotiations are more likely to dominate if synergies increase in bidders' productivity types (as with acquirer‐target complementarities in M&amp;A). Higher dispersion and magnitude of bidders' private valuations also favor negotiations.</content>

    <title>Digital Affective Encounters: The Relational Role of Content Circulation on Social Media</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One of the most ubiquitous practices on social media is sharing content with others to show affection or affirm an interpersonal connection. Extant consumer research has examined the circulation of objects fueled by desire or as repositories and carriers of emotion and value. The paper extends this work to understand how consumer relationships are shaped through the creation, consumption, and circulation of digital objects imbued with affect. Drawing upon interviews with both managers and followers of animal accounts and netnographic data of animal content on Instagram, this work theorizes how digital affective encounters on social media transpire through the circulation of animal content. The findings highlight the processes through which content is continuously imbued with affective cues to manage parasocial and interpersonal relationships. While affect-laden content can serve as a relational token when shared between friends and family, it can also be captured and modified by large accounts. As a result, the affective force of this content can reach mass audiences and become memetic. Our paper shows the significant role of affect as a mobilizing force of digital affective networks. Beyond animal content, the framework is transferable to the circulation of other social media content and consumer-influencer relationships.</content>

    <title>Strategic Best-Response Fairness Framework for Fair Machine Learning</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study introduces a framework called “strategic best-response fairness” (SBR-fairness) to address discrimination perpetuated by machine-learning (ML) algorithms. It challenges the conventional focus on fairness solely in prediction results, arguing that this approach ignores how individuals affected by the predictions may alter their behavior in response to algorithmic decisions. The framework considers whether an algorithm, trained on potentially biased data, leads to identical equilibrium behaviors across different subpopulations that are ex ante identical. The study finds that common fair-ML algorithms, such as those relying on color-blindness and demographic parity fairness criteria, do not always achieve SBR fairness. This means that they may not eliminate disparities in effort and outcomes. Equalized odds (EO), however, have been shown to achieve SBR fairness, but they suffer from several practical limitations. The study proposes that SBR fairness is a necessary condition for breaking cycles of discrimination in ML. It also argues that SBR fairness offers a complementary way to assess other fairness criteria and understand behavioral responses. The findings suggest a need for policy and practical focus on designing SBR-fair algorithms that promote equitable outcomes at both the prediction and behavioral level.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by modern-day applications such as attended home delivery and preference-based group scheduling, where decision makers wish to steer a large number of customers toward choosing the exact same alternative, we introduce a novel class of assortment optimization problems, referred to as maximum load assortment optimization. In such settings, given a universe of substitutable products, we are facing a stream of customers, each choosing between either selecting a product out of an offered assortment or opting to leave without making a selection. Assuming that these decisions are governed by the multinomial logit choice model, we define the random load of any underlying product as the total number of customers who select it. Our objective is to offer an assortment of products to each customer so that the expected maximum load across all products is maximized. We consider both static and dynamic formulations of the maximum load assortment optimization problem. In the static setting, a single offer set is carried throughout the entire process of customer arrivals, whereas in the dynamic setting, the decision maker offers a personalized assortment to each customer, based on the entire information available at that time. As can only be expected, both formulations present a wide range of computational challenges and analytical questions. The main contribution of this paper resides in proposing efficient algorithmic approaches for computing near-optimal static and dynamic assortment policies. In particular, we develop a polynomial time approximation scheme for the static problem formulation. Additionally, we demonstrate that an elegant policy utilizing weight-ordered assortments yields a 1/2 approximation. Concurrently, we prove that such policies are sufficiently strong to provide a 1/4 approximation with respect to the dynamic formulation, establishing a constant factor bound on its adaptivity gap. Finally, we design an adaptive policy whose expected maximum load is within factor [Formula: see text] of optimal, admitting a quasi-polynomial time implementation.Funding: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [Grant CMMI-2226900 to O.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this work, we revisit the multi-item order fulfillment model introduced by Jasin and Sinha (2015). Specifically, we study a dynamic setting in which an e-commerce platform (or online retailer) with multiple warehouses and finite inventory faces the problem of fulfilling orders that may contain multiple items. The platform’s goal is to minimize the expected cost incurred from the fulfillment process, subject to warehouses’ inventory constraints. Differing from the classical literature on multi-item fulfillment, we use the method-based formulation to design a class of dynamic policies that combine ideas from randomized fulfillment, prophet inequalities, and subgradient methods for the general multi-item fulfillment model. Specifically, by establishing connections between the fulfillment and prophet inequality literature, we prove that our algorithm has strong approximation guarantees in nonasymptotic settings, which also happens to be asymptotically optimal. Our result shows that there is a simple and near-optimal procedure for solving multi-item fulfillment problems once the online retailer has enough inventory, independent of other problem parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of this type in the context of multi-item order fulfillment. In addition, and of independent interest, our analysis also leads to new asymptotically optimal bounds for network revenue management problems.This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, market design, platform, and demand analytics.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00357 .</content>

    <title>Backup Plans: The Impact of Disclosure on Perceptions of Expert Competence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;People often consult experts to provide solutions to their problems. Oftentimes, an initial attempt to solve a problem fails, and these experts (e.g., advisors, consultants, specialists, and service providers) will resort to a backup plan. A backup plan can be presented when it is needed (i.e., after an initial failure) or in advance (i.e., before a potential failure). We examine how the timing of disclosure of a backup plan affects judgments of an expert’s competence. We show that although people expect experts to have a backup plan, they react more negatively if it is presented after (versus before) it is needed, all things equal. This “competence penalty” disappears when people are prompted to think about what an expert would do in case of failure as indeed, an alternative plan is expected. Importantly, our findings indicate that there is no competence penalty for early disclosure of a backup plan, regardless of the outcome of the initial plan: if it has failed, has succeeded, or is still ongoing. However, we do find one exception; early disclosure has a negative impact if multiple backup plans are disclosed while the initial plan is in progress.This paper was accepted by Jack Soll, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: Funding for all studies was provided by the MUMA College of Business, University of South Florida.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02615 .</content>

    <title>Bridging Institutional Theory and Social and Environmental Efforts in Management: A Review and Research Agenda</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This review examines the integration of institutional theory with social and environmental efforts in management (i.e., regarding sustainability, corporate social responsibility, and environmental, social, and governance objectives). By analyzing 720 studies published between 1997 and 2023, we develop a multi-level model that maps the antecedents of different actors (e.g., industries, organizations, individuals) to respond to or reshape institutional structures, the mechanisms they use, the moderators, and outcomes of their practices. Our findings emphasize the dynamic interplay between structure and agency across systemic, organizational, and individual levels, offering a comprehensive framework for future research. We highlight three key observations: first, while substantial research explores how institutions shape actors, more attention is needed to understand the reciprocal influences as actors are shaped by and reshape institutions over time. Second, individual-level dynamics remain significantly underexplored, with limited focus on resistance, demotivation, and failure—essential elements of the complexity of institutional processes. Finally, we identify a critical need to examine the unintended consequences of social and environmental efforts, revealing how these endeavors may undermine their goals, create new challenges, or generate unexpected solutions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;IPO underwriters have an incentive to underprice an IPO when they allocate shares to their affiliated funds. We label this conflict of interest “supernepotism” and we analyze its effect on IPO pricing. Using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) on a novel hand-collected data set, we find that higher allocations to underwriter-affiliated funds cause higher IPO underpricing. Our evidence suggests that supernepotism has monetary costs for issuers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Stealth mergers” are not reported to the government because they fall below the required size threshold. We study stealth mergers involving public targets for which manipulation of transaction sizes is unlikely. These stealth mergers result in less R&amp;D spending, patenting, and capital expenditures, and in lower value patents for both acquiring firms and their competitors relative to non-stealth mergers. Industry concentration increases, and product market competition decreases for stealth acquirers. Stealth acquirers and their competitors earn higher cumulative abnormal returns relative to non-stealth mergers. Our results suggest more government scrutiny is warranted for stealth mergers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Financial losses can have persistent effects on the financial system. This article proposes an empirical measure for the duration of these effects, Spillover Persistence. I document that Spillover Persistence is strongly correlated with financial conditions; during banking crises, Spillover Persistence is higher, whereas in the run-up phase of stock market bubbles, it is lower. Lower Spillover Persistence also associates with a more fragile system, for example, a higher probability of future crises, consistent with the volatility paradox. The results emphasize the dynamics of loss spillovers as an important dimension of systemic risk and financial constraints as a key determinant of persistence.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Personalized Content in Media Entertainment on Engagement with the Domain</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;From Netflix to Spotify to TikTok, consumers’ entertainment experiences increasingly revolve around personalized content. Does consuming personalized content in a specific entertainment domain influence the likelihood of consumers discussing that domain overall, beyond the specific content they engage with? Across eleven experiments, we investigate the impact of personalized content in the music and short-form video domains (ie, content that feels tailored to one’s tastes) on the intent to discuss domain-related topics. We find that the impact of consuming personalized content (vs. other types of content or no content) on discussion intent varies depending on the strength of an individual’s identification with the domain. For weak identifiers, personalized content increases discussion intent, whereas for strong identifiers, it decreases intent. Process evidence highlights two underlying psychological forces: enhanced enjoyment of the domain and diminished confidence in domain knowledge. Personalized content increases discussion intent for weak identifiers—users whose intent is likely driven by high enjoyment. In contrast, personalized content decreases discussion intent for strong identifiers—users whose intent is likely driven by low confidence.</content>

    <title>From Stigma to Support: ‘Black-Owned’ Labels and Expertise Stereotypes in Cannabis and Psychedelics Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the effect of ‘Black-owned’ labeling on cannabis and psychedelic brands, in context of the stigmatized and risky nature of the drugs category. Building on prior studies examining social justice or discrimination, we introduce an expertise stereotype framework. As Study 1, we surveyed 37 Black professionals in the drugs industry about expectations regarding ‘Black-owned’ labels, as juxtaposition to consumer responses in the following studies. In Study 2, we measured expertise stereotypes about Black and women entrepreneurs across various product types. Utilizing these findings, we contrasted the effect of ‘Black-owned’ labels on cannabis versus candy products in Study 3. ‘Black-owned’ labeling increased Black participants’ intentions to consume candy, but not cannabis; and the pattern reversed for White participants such that ‘Black-owned’ labeling increased their intentions only for cannabis. Whereas out-group members’ response is consistent with expertise stereotypes, in-group members’ support does not extend to the stigmatized category. In Study 4, field ad campaigns revealed that ‘Black-owned’ (vs. no) label increases click-through by 21% on a psychedelics ad, while a ‘Woman-owned’ (vs. no) label reduces by 15%, consistent with expertise stereotypes. These findings advance the discourse on ownership labeling and provide insight into nuanced consumer responses in this category.</content>

    <title>Visual Uniqueness in Peer-to-Peer Marketplaces: Machine Learning Model Development, Validation, and Application</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces have seen exponential growth in recent years, featuring unique offerings from individual providers. However, scalable quantification of visual uniqueness and their impacts on platforms like Airbnb remains largely unexplored. We address this gap by developing, validating, and applying an unsupervised machine learning model to automatically extract uniqueness from images and quantify its impact on demand. We first construct a machine learning model, informed by cognitive psychology, to assess visual uniqueness in 481,747 property images, achieving high accuracy and interpretability. Next, we validate our model through three studies involving various participant populations and methods, confirming that the model’s predictions of visual uniqueness align with human judgment. Finally, we apply this model to demand data of Airbnb properties in New York City spanning 13 months. We find an inverted U-shaped relationship between visual uniqueness and demand, with two significant moderation effects: properties with higher response rates or overall ratings benefit more from visual uniqueness. This research provides valuable insights for P2P platforms like Airbnb, highlighting the strategic use of visual uniqueness to enhance visual appeal and market performance. It also offers a new methodological roadmap for integrating psychological insights into the development and validation of unsupervised machine learning models.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Agents help consumers make decisions. While agents have traditionally been human (e.g., sales associate, real estate agent, financial advisor), artificial intelligence (AI) agents are becoming more prevalent. We find that the type of agent, AI versus human, has an influence on intertemporal judgment. Specifically, when an agent is identified as AI, the concept of fast processing becomes more accessible, which makes time delays seem subjectively longer and encourages impatient behavior. These results have implications for how to conceptualize the influence of AI agents on judgment, the impact of time perception on intertemporal choices, and the sources of impatient behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Complexity in applying financial accounting standards can have real operational effects if firms alter their actions in response to increased reporting costs. We examine whether the introduction of ASU 2017‐12, designed to reduce compliance burden and better align hedge accounting rules with risk management practices, led to more effective hedging. Using detailed hedging disclosures, we show that firms that adopt the ASU expand the use of hedge‐accounted derivatives and reduce exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risks. ASU‐adopting firms also reduce cash flow volatility, increase their use of debt, invest more, and reduce information asymmetry in the equity market. Our analyses reveal that easing hedge effectiveness tests and reliefs targeting “cash flow hedges” and “net investment hedges of foreign operations” were the most influential of the ASU's reforms. Our study is the first to integrate the effects of hedge accounting frictions on firms’ risk management activities and resulting spillovers to debt financing and investments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on organizational climate change adaptation has focused on high‐income nations, neglecting vulnerable regions already facing severe climate impacts. This study addresses this gap by examining how decision‐makers in vulnerable contexts respond to climate change, drawing on a unique panel dataset of over 3000 agricultural producers in Brazil. Using an abductive mixed‐methods approach, we develop a framework that explains how, contrary to findings from high‐income contexts, the experience of climate change and the resulting heightened perception of climate change risk are more likely to increase maladaptive rather than adaptive responses. These maladaptive responses create “climate traps”—vicious cycles driven by the interplay between decision‐makers' perceptions and ecological feedback loops, which further exacerbate vulnerability. Our framework offers a foundation for understanding adaptation patterns in vulnerable contexts.Managerial SummaryClimate change poses significant challenges for decision‐makers, particularly in vulnerable regions where adaptation is critical for survival. This study examines how small agricultural producers in Brazil respond to climate change, revealing that, rather than adopting adaptive strategies, many implement maladaptive responses that exacerbate their future vulnerability. Using both quantitative and qualitative data, we find that the experience of climate change and a heightened risk perception drive short‐term survival strategies, creating “climate traps” that reinforce ecological and economic distress. Emotions such as fear and hopelessness play a crucial role in fostering decisions that prioritize immediate relief over long‐term resilience. This research highlights the need for interventions that account for the psychological barriers to adaptation in these contexts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I find that foreign multinational firms engage in tax-motivated income shifting out of the United States. The analysis uses novel data on foreign-owned U.S. subsidiaries as well as variation in foreign countries’ tax rates and controlled foreign corporation rules. Foreign multinational firms primarily rely on tax-motivated transfer pricing to shift income out of the United States, and the aggregate amount of shifted income is modest. When foreign tax policy changes inhibit income shifting, foreign-owned U.S. subsidiaries’ investment and employment fall. The results indicate that the U.S. economy has limited exposure to tax policies set abroad through foreign direct investment in the United States. (JEL H26, F23, F21, M51)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To best utilize labor, companies need to match employees’ skills with jobs that best fit those skills. Exploiting unique features of the mutual fund industry, we identify instances when this matching happens for fund managers and study its consequences. When fund managers are matched, they deliver a significantly higher risk-adjusted performance. Fund companies use this information to maximize company value by increasing assets under the management of these managers (i.e., assigning them to more and larger funds) and by collecting higher fees from these managers’ funds. In addition, they make the expertise of these managers available to other managers of the fund company.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02805 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Future making, the work of enacting the yet‐to‐come by making sense of and giving form to imaginings of the future, has become topical in management studies lately. Triggered by pressing societal challenges like climate change, inequality and threatened democratic institutions vis‐à‐vis a societal ‘crisis mode’, management scholars have started to engage with the future as an open‐ended temporal category, both as an object of analysis happening in and around organizations, as well as a way of scholarly inquiry. ThisPoint‐Counterpointdebate about future making in management research comes right on time, as future‐making research seems to be at a crossroads, potentially heading to a bright – or not so bright – future. The contributions to this debate collectively ask: What is the future of future making in management research, and they could not be more different in the pathways they envisage.</content>

    <title>Revisiting the liability of foreignness: political ideology, globalization, and discrimination</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Equal treatment of foreign and local firms is the cornerstone of international investment law. Yet, why do foreign firms face discrimination in host countries? We analyze this critical but underexplored aspect of the liability of foreignness in two stages. First, drawing on the insights from political science, we argue that the political ideology of the host government along the left-right spectrum drives discriminatory dynamics, resulting in elevated regulatory risk for foreign firms. Next, we argue that globalization moderates the relative regulatory risk while distinguishing political and social dimensions of globalization: political globalization amplifies the effect of ideology on discrimination, while social globalization mitigates it. We validate our theory using tax inspection data on 38,326 firms across 95 countries from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys between 2008 and 2019. We identify a novel, context-specific source of discrimination revealing how political ideology and globalization jointly shape the regulatory risk of foreign firms. We advance a growing stream of research that explores how political ideologies shape international business. CEOs must recognize that political ideology can drive discrimination risk and that globalization is a double-edged sword. Strategic planning demands nuanced integration of both factors to successfully mitigate discrimination in international markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Focusing on the one‐off tax gains and losses (i.e., windfalls) associated with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we reexamine whether CEOs are rewarded for luck. We find that weakly monitored CEOs are compensated for the windfall tax gains but not penalized for the corresponding tax losses. No such pattern is observed for CEOs facing greater pay scrutiny. The pay for windfalls cannot be explained as rewards for CEOs’ efforts, talents, political activities, or as firms sharing their tax gains with all executives. The results are more consistent with rent extraction by CEOs facing weak pay scrutiny.</content>

    <title>Conflicting Priorities: A Theory of Covenants and Collateral</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a theory of secured debt, unsecured debt, and debt with anti‐dilution covenants. We assume that, as in practice, covenants convey the right to accelerate if violated, but the new secured debt retains its priority even if issued in violation of covenants. We find that such covenants are nonetheless useful: They provide state‐contingent financing flexibility, balancing over‐ and underinvestment incentives. The optimal debt structure is multilayered, combining secured and unsecured debt with and without covenants. Our results are consistent with observations about debt structure, covenant violations, and waivers. They speak to a policy debate about debt priority.</content>

    <title>How Much Does Racial Bias Affect Mortgage Lending? Evidence from Human and Algorithmic Credit Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We assess racial discrimination in mortgage approvals using confidential data on mortgage applications. Minority applicants tend to have lower credit scores and higher leverage, and are less likely to receive algorithmic approval from race‐blind automated underwriting systems (AUS). Observable applicant‐risk factors explain most of the racial disparities in lender denials. Further, exploiting the AUS data, we show there are risk factors we do not observe, and these factors at least partially explain the residual 1 to 2 percentage point denial gaps. We conclude that differential treatment plays a more limited role in generating denial disparities than previous research suggests.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present the first comprehensive descriptive evidence on the labor market and personal consequences for audit professionals in the United States who are named in SEC or PCAOB enforcement actions. Three key findings emerge. First, between 38% and 73% of culpable auditors depart from their firms within one year after the enforcement event. These departure rates are three to four times higher compared with a sample of non‐culpable auditors. Second, 83% of culpable auditors departing from Big 4 accounting firms exit the profession, compared with 58% of a departing non‐culpable comparison group. In contrast, about 77% of the culpable auditors leaving non–Big 4 accounting firms remain in public accounting, compared with 51% of a departing non‐culpable comparison group. Third, using novel data on personal real estate holdings, we find that culpable auditors do not appear to engage in markedly different transactions around enforcement compared with a comparison sample of non‐culpable individuals.</content>

    <title>Irrationality-Aware Human Machine Collaboration: Mitigating Alterfactual Irrationality in Copy Trading</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are trained on human-generated data, but what if that data reflects irrational human decision making? To tackle this challenge, Shen et al. developed a new irrationality-aware human-machine collaboration (IA-HMC) framework, designed to help AI recognize and adapt to human irrationality. A key concept introduced in this framework is “alterfactual irrationality”—a term used to describe human decisions influenced by irrelevant alternatives. The researchers applied this idea to copy trading, a popular investment strategy where everyday investors (followers) mimic the trades of expert traders. They identified two major irrational behaviors affecting followers: herding behavior—blindly following others without independent analysis; and identity bias—making investment choices based on who made the trade rather than its actual merit. By developing irrationality-aware machine learning methods, the study showed that AI can help followers make better trading decisions. Their approach led to a 49% improvement in success rates compared to human decisions alone and a 10.2% improvement over previous AI-driven methods. This research presents an innovative approach in human-AI collaboration, showing that for AI to truly align with human needs, it must first learn to account for and correct human irrationality.</content>
