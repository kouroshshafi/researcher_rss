    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fair and Efficient Allocation Algorithms Do Not Require Knowing Exact Item ValuesFood rescue organizations are tasked with allocating often-unpredictable donations to recipients who need it. For a large class of recipient valuation functions, this can be done in a fair and efficient manner as long as each recipient reports their value for each arriving donation. In practice, however, such valuations are rarely elicited. In “Dynamic Fair Division with Partial Information,” Benadè, Halpern, and Psomas ask whether simultaneous fairness and efficiency remain possible when the allocator receives limited information about recipient valuations, even as little as a single binary signal. For recipients with i.i.d. or correlated values, the paper provides an algorithm which is envy-free and 1-epsilon welfare-maximizing with high probability. Asymptotically tight results are also established for independent, nonidentical agents. This shows that fair and efficient online allocation algorithms do not critically rely on recipients being able to precisely report their utility functions.</content>

    <title>You’ve Got Mail! The Late 19th Century U.S. Postal Service Expansion, Firm Creation, and Firm Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of the expansion of the U.S. Postal Service in the late 19th century on firm creation and performance. Utilizing newly digitized archival data on historic business establishments, post office locations, and road networks in California, our study identifies a positive relationship between the expansion of the Postal Service and the emergence of new firms. To address endogeneity concerns, we leverage an unexpected change in the Postal Service route network. Our findings suggest that the Postal Service played a significant role in facilitating firm entry by acting as a carrier of specialized knowledge rather than as a financial service or mass communication infrastructure. We further reveal that, although increased competition from new entrants generally exerted downward pressure on incumbent firms, those relying on specialized knowledge and public technology inputs significantly benefited from local Postal Service access. Taken together, our study underscores the critical role played by the Postal Service in knowledge diffusion and local economic development by enabling the sourcing of specialized knowledge and technologies from other geographies. Overall, our results contribute to a broader understanding of how communication and knowledge dissemination infrastructure can drive entrepreneurship and firm growth, carrying important implications for contemporary discussions on infrastructure development, its potential to stimulate entrepreneurial activity, innovation, and foster local economic communities.This paper was accepted by Olav Sorenson, organizations.Funding: The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the Harvard Business School Division of Research and Faculty Development.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03369 .</content>

    <title>Impact of OM Content in Earnings Calls on a Firm’s Stock Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate whether and to what extent financial markets value and respond to operations management (OM)-related information in quarterly earnings calls directed toward financial market participants. We develop and use a novel construct called “stated OM focus” (SOMF) to mine the incidence of and emphasis on OM information in the quarterly earnings conference calls for a large cross-section of firms (S&amp;P 1500) over a time frame of 15 years. We empirically establish the value-relevance of OM information as well as summarize and capture both explanatory and predictive aspects of the OM function’s contribution to firm value. We show that OM-related information disclosed by firms systematically, significantly, positively, and persistently affects abnormal stock returns after controlling for known covariates and controls (financial metrics, standard OM metrics, firm and time effects, and lexical-structure related) and after accounting for earnings surprise. Furthermore, we find evidence that firms’ stated OM focus bears significant predictive power in the short term. Long-short portfolios, created using a sorting signal derived solely from stated OM-focus information, predict future abnormal returns consistently over one, two and three months forward from the earnings call event. We show that the OM information metric is reliable and bears internal, external, and predictive validity. These findings offer useful implications for firms, financial market participants, and OM function stakeholders.This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02221 .</content>

    <title>Multicell Experiments for Marginal Treatment Effect Estimation of Digital Ads</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Randomized experiments with treatment and control groups are an important tool to measure the impacts of interventions. However, in experimental settings with one-sided noncompliance extant empirical approaches may not produce the estimands a decision maker needs to solve the problem of interest. For example, these experimental designs are common in digital advertising settings but typical methods do not yield effects that inform the intensive margin: how many consumers should be reached or how much should be spent on a campaign. We propose a solution that combines a novel multicell experimental design with modern estimation techniques that enables decision makers to solve problems with an intensive margin. Our design is straightforward to implement and does not require additional budget. We illustrate our method through simulations calibrated using an advertising experiment at Facebook, demonstrating its superior performance in various scenarios and its advantage over direct optimization approaches.This paper was accepted by Jean-Pierre Dubé, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01185 .</content>

    <title>Subcoalition Cluster Analysis: A New Method for Modeling Conflict in Organizations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The renewed interest among managers and management researchers in stakeholder governance has also underscored the shortage of quantitative methods available for studying business firms as political systems. A critical problem for researchers applying coalition-based theories of organizational politics to observational data is that the units of analysis, coined “subcoalitions,” are often unobservable. This paper introduces subcoalition cluster analysis (SCA) as a new computational framework for analyzing intrafirm conflict that permits researchers to model groups of heterogeneous actors in terms of a smaller set of representative subcoalitions. The SCA approach to identifying latent fault-lines among groups of actors is based on widely held ideas in management research about the structure of intrafirm coalition politics, is computationally practicable in settings with many alternatives or actors, and can be straightforwardly applied to observational settings with incomplete data on actor preferences. We then apply SCA to two cases in which an organization characterized by multiple, partially inconsistent goals and stakeholders with heterogeneous preferences face a politically contested decision. In both cases, we first analyze preference data using SCA to identify the subcoalition structure that best characterizes the set of actors in the organization. We then use the SCA output as a dependent variable in an analysis of the predictors of subcoalition membership in the first case and as an independent variable in an analysis of the changing patterns of social influence in the second.This paper was accepted by Lamar Pierce, organizations.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.00013 .</content>

    <title>Food categorization determines whether healthier food is inferred to be tastier or less tasty</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite evidence that people believe that the unhealthier the food, the tastier it is, some studies also suggest the opposing belief—the healthier the food, the tastier it is. A framework is proposed to reconcile this contradiction, and four studies demonstrate that the discrete categorization of foods as healthful versus unhealthful determines which intuition consumers use. When stereotypically unhealthy foods (e.g., candies, ice cream, hot dogs) are encountered, they are automatically categorized as unhealthful and the properties associated with that category (e.g., sweetness, saltiness, fat content) become accessible. Inferences about taste are then based on these properties and the unhealthier the encountered products are (i.e., the higher the sugar and fat content they have), the tastier they are perceived to be (unhealthy = tasty belief). Conversely, when stereotypically healthful foods (e.g., fruits) are encountered, other properties (e.g., freshness, vitamins) become salient, and tastiness is mainly inferred based on these properties, leading to the inference that the healthier these foods are (i.e., the more freshness and vitamins they have), the tastier they are perceived to be (healthy = tasty belief). Marketers and policymakers can leverage these findings to understand better when emphasizing healthiness benefits or hurts taste perceptions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Institutional investors affected by hurricanes subsequently support environmental proposals in non-affected firms even if they never voted for similar initiatives. Affected investors raise their holdings in firms where their pro-environment votes are consequential. The increased voting support after hurricanes has real effects as environmental proposals endorsed by more hurricane-afflicted investors are more likely to pass. Moreover, both market capitalization and analysts’ recommendations decline after firms pass environmental proposals. Our evidence suggests that natural disasters raise institutional investors’ concerns about the environment and about potential fund flow disruptions. These concerns, in turn, influence environmental activism, corporate policies, and firm performance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;People's value of their own time is a key input in public policy evaluations—these evaluations should account for time taken away from work or leisure as a result of policy. Measuring this value for the self-employed is challenging, as, by definition, it is not priced by the market. Using rich choice data collected from farming households in western Kenya, we show that households exhibit non-transitive preferences. As a result, neither market wages nor standard valuation techniques correctly measure participants’ value of time. Using a structural model, we identify the behavioral wedges in participants’ choices, and find that distortions appear when households exchange cash either for time or for goods. Our model estimates suggest that valuing the time of the self-employed at 60% of the market wage is a reasonable rule of thumb.</content>

    <title>Diversification Quotients: Quantifying Diversification via Risk Measures</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We establish the first axiomatic theory for diversification indices using six intuitive axioms: nonnegativity, location invariance, scale invariance, rationality, normalization, and continuity. The unique class of indices satisfying these axioms, called the diversification quotients (DQs), are defined based on a parametric family of risk measures. A further axiom of portfolio convexity pins down DQs based on coherent risk measures. The DQ has many attractive properties, and it can address several theoretical and practical limitations of existing indices. In particular, for the popular risk measures value at risk and expected shortfall, the corresponding DQ admits simple formulas, and it is efficient to optimize in portfolio selection. Moreover, it can properly capture tail heaviness and common shocks, which are neglected by traditional diversification indices. When illustrated with financial data, the DQ is intuitive to interpret, and its performance is competitive against other diversification indices.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: X.

    <title>Lay Theories of Expertise: A Mixed‐Methods Exploration</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Failure to engage with expertise underpins many organizational and societal problems. Despite decades of research on expertise, we still do not fully understand why such failures persist, and there is a sense that these failures are becoming a crisis of expertise. In this article, we highlight a person's system of beliefs about the meaning of expertise – what we term theirlay theory of expertise(LTE) – as an important factor for understanding their engagement with expertise. Through a free response study (Study 1), analysis of social media data (Study 2), and word sorting study (Study 3), we first develop a taxonomy of common LTE elements. We then examine how LTEs affect expert recognition via two experiments with managers (Studies 4 and 5). Study 4 reveals that congruence between the most psychologically active element of a person's lay theory and expert conduct is conducive to expert recognition, while Study 5 highlights that (in)congruence between LTEs and expert conduct can alter how other mental representations (such as gender stereotypes) shape expert recognition. Our work provides a conceptual foundation for exploring variation in the subjective meaning of expertise in future research on expert recognition and engagement, both within and beyond organizations.</content>

    <title>Corporate Short-Termism: A Review and Research Agenda</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Corporate short-termism, defined as a managerial preference for the short term that undermines a firm’s long-term interests, has become a topic of global concern for governments, investors, and business leaders. In recent years, heightened capital market pressures to maximize shareholder value have intensified focus on the issue, raising concerns that the pursuit of short-term shareholder value may come at the expense of long-term prospects and corporate sustainability. Our review reveals that despite abundant research on short-termism, we have only a fragmented understanding of the factors driving this phenomenon and its consequences. The difficulty of operationalizing the construct and the various firm actions and outcomes examined has hindered consensus as to the specific antecedents and implications of managers’ preference for the short term. Our paper seeks to provide greater clarity on corporate short-termism and to develop a framework for understanding what motivates management to prioritize the short term over the long term and the firm-level consequences of related decisions. In doing so, we hope to advance our state of knowledge on this important issue and motivate scholars to more fully unpack the drivers and outcomes of corporate short-termism.</content>

    <title>Financial Reporting Around Private Firms' Securities Offerings</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates how U.S. private firms communicate with investors around private securities offerings. Using multiple research methods including survey, interview, and archival analysis, I provide systematic evidence on private firms' public and private disclosure practices. I find that despite engaging in a low level of public disclosures, private firms actively communicate with investors through private communication channels, with notable variation across firms in terms of content and frequency. Consistent with managers providing relevant information, financial information is disclosed when it is particularly useful for investors' decision‐making. Furthermore, I explore the relation between private communication and public disclosure preferences and find a substitutive effect, suggesting that private firms may strategically manage communication channels to effectively engage with investors. This study contributes to the literature by describing the existing disclosure landscape of private firms.</content>

    <title>CSR as Hedging Against Institutional Transition Risk: Corporate Philanthropy After the Sunflower Movement in Taiwan</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms with political connections to a regime with an authoritarian history face a dilemma when the regime undergoes a democratic transition. Such connections provide an essential competitive advantage when the regime is in power but become a liability when an institutional transition brings democratic change. This study theorizes that when mass protests expose a regime’s distorted policies favoring elites over others and signal a high probability of regime turnover, firms may hedge against the risks associated with their political connections by engaging in philanthropy. We further contend that this effect is stronger for firms located in regions characterized by the rise of an opposing political party or a strong civil society. We find support for our theory in Taiwan’s 2014 Sunflower Movement. Our article reveals a strategy that firms adopt to survive democratic transitions and thus contributes to research on how firms use non-market strategies to adapt to institutional changes. Our research also shows that strategic corporate social responsibility (CSR) can substitute for corporate political activity or compensate for its limitations, and it expands research on the signaling function of social movements from public to private politics.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify phrases associated with novel technologies using textual analysis of patents, job postings, and earnings calls, enabling us to identify four stylized facts on the diffusion of jobs relating to new technologies. First, the development of economically impactful new technologies is geographically highly concentrated, more so even than overall patenting: 56% of the most economically impactful technologies come from just two U.S. locations, Silicon Valley and the Northeast Corridor. Second, as the technologies mature and the number of related jobs grows, hiring spreads geographically. But this process is very slow, taking around 50 years to disperse fully. Third, while initial hiring in new technologies is highly skill biased, over time the mean skill level in new positions declines, drawing in an increasing number of lower-skilled workers. Finally, the geographic spread of hiring is slowest for higher-skilled positions, with the locations where new technologies were pioneered remaining the focus for the technology's high-skill jobs for decades.</content>

    <title>“Optimal” Feedback Use in Crowdsourcing Contests: Source Effect and Priming Intervention</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crowdsourcing contests allow firms to seek ideas from external solvers to address their problems. This research examines solvers’ use of developmental feedback from different sources and of different constructiveness when generating ideas in contests. I theorize a source effect in solvers’ feedback use where they use seeker feedback more than peer feedback, even if both give identical suggestions for their ideas. I also show how the source effect affects solvers’ use of constructive and less constructive feedback from the respective sources. An insight is that compared with their use of peer feedback, solvers’ use of seeker feedback is more extensive at any level of, but less sensitive to, feedback constructiveness. An implication is that solvers may underuse constructive peer feedback and overuse less constructive seeker feedback. Such behaviors can be solver optimal (in terms of improving solvers’ winning prospects) but not seeker optimal (in terms of enhancing ideas for seekers’ problems), as constructive feedback is likely to improve idea quality, whereas less constructive feedback may hurt it. I propose a priming intervention of a feedback evaluation mechanism to mitigate the source effect in solvers’ feedback use—in a way, the intervention can cause solvers to behave more optimally for the seekers. A field survey and three online experiments test the theorizing and proposed intervention. I discuss the contributions and implications of this research for various stakeholders in crowdsourcing contests.Funding: This work was supported by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council [Grant 16502518].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2021.15885 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the impact that social movements have on firm innovation through private politics. We argue that firms strategically respond to private politics by investing in new technologies that address movement-advocated issues material to firms’ performance. Although both contentious private politics—when activists contentiously target firms—and cooperative private politics—when activists and firms collaborate—catalyze innovation, they do so in different ways. Contentious private politics increases the amount of innovation that firms undertake by drawing managerial attention to movement-advocated issues material to the firm, prompting search for solutions to those issues. Conversely, cooperative private politics provides firms access to new knowledge that encourages firms to search for solutions in areas more distant from their existing knowledge and in so doing, increase innovation involving distant recombination on material issues. We find support for our arguments in a matched sample of firms contentiously targeted and with activist collaborations on climate change issues and firms that were not targets of private politics on those issues but had otherwise similar histories of climate-related innovation and relationships with climate movements and other environmental movements. Supplementary analyses corroborate the mechanisms that undergird our theoretical predictions; contentious private politics is associated with more innovation closer to a firm’s expertise, whereas cooperative private politics is associated with innovations that draw on more distant knowledge. We also find that when collaboration follows contention, their respective impacts on innovation are reduced, which may result from firms seeking collaborations for their legitimacy-granting benefits after contention rather than the learning opportunities they offer.Funding: Funding for this research was provided by the Strategic Management Society Strategy Research Foundation [dissertation grant] and Wharton’s Mack Institute for Innovation Management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17497 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Variation in functional expertise is an important decision that managers face when designing teams tasked with being creative. We develop theory that predicts that functional diversity has countervailing effects on team creativity through its positive (negative) effect on the uniqueness (usefulness) of the proposals generated. We conduct an experiment where functionally homogeneous or heterogeneous two-person teams are tasked with proposing a creative use for an unused university space. We measure the uniqueness, usefulness, and overall creativity of team proposals. We also use functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging technology to investigate the underlying team cognitive processes. Measured outcomes and fNIRS data support our predictions. Combining conventional experiment and advanced neuroimaging techniques, our study informs theory and practice by providing evidence of how functional diversity affects team creativity.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NA) [Grant 72172132] and CPA Ontario’s Centre for Sustainability Reporting and Performance Management (NA).Supplemental Material: The online supplemental appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02157 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how the level of detail in legal regulations impacts crowdfunding. We find that clear, explicit regulations significantly boost crowdfunding volumes in a global sample of digital finance. Using proxies to measure regulatory detail in three types of countries—countries that sometimes, always, or never had regulation—in a series of difference-in-difference regressions, we show a significant positive relation between regulatory clarity and the level of debt crowdfunding. There is little effect on the level of equity crowdfunding. Clear regulations appear to encourage the creation of new crowdfunding platforms rather than concentrating activity in existing ones.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01538 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The capability of higher-ability managers to acquire and use resources more efficiently than lower-ability managers suggests a positive linear relation between labor investment efficiency (LIE) and managerial ability (MA). However, a puzzle emerges about how the best managers set themselves apart from their peers, calling into question the linearity of the relation between LIE and MA. We explore this puzzle by asking how the highest-ability managers achieve the highest performance levels. We then investigate this puzzle empirically by considering alternatives to a linear relation between LIE and MA. We begin with the distinction that managers achieve the highest performance when they combine efficient exploitation of existing products and services with successful exploration for innovations in products and services. This point is relevant to our puzzle because a firm’s labor needs for exploration are high and unpredictable. Thus, we expect the highest-ability managers to purposefully invest more than predicted by a model of optimal labor investment across firms. In contrast, we expect low-ability managers, who are less able to evaluate, forecast, and make efficient investments, to deviate more from predicted labor investment and vacillate between over- and underinvestment. We present evidence that supports our predictions of nonlinear relations between LIE and MA, with high-ability managers investing more than predicted and low-ability managers over- and underinvesting. We make and test related hypotheses about exploration (investment in research and development), and we probe further by relating future firm performance to over- and underinvestment in labor for different levels of MA.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the CPA Alberta Education Foundation.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.01932 .</content>

    <title>When Neurodiversity and Ethnicity Combine: Intersectional Stereotyping and Workplace Experiences of Neurodivergent Ethnic Minority Employees</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the workplace experiences of 51 ethnic minority professionals who self‐identify as neurodivergent, focusing specifically on the impact of intersectional stereotyping within organizations in the United Kingdom and United States. Drawing on models of intersectional stereotyping, the research explores how neurodivergent employees' racial or ethnic minority backgrounds influence their self‐perceptions and experiences regarding prevailing stereotypes in professional environments. Semi‐structured interviews reveal that neurodiversity intersects with ethnicity, to either amplify or mitigate prevailing stereotypes during recruitment, performance evaluations, and career progression. Specifically, for Black and Latinx professionals, neurodiversity intensifies pejorative assumptions, reinforcing deficit stereotypes, while for Asian participants, neurodiversity can contradict the “model minority” stereotype. Neurodivergent behaviors are often seen as cultural mismatches with dominant norms, leading individuals to employ identity management strategies for professional advancement. This study extends general HRM diversity and neurodiversity research agendas by elucidating salient intragroup differences at this intersection, expanding intersectional stereotyping literature to include neurodiversity, and underscoring the practical need for integrated organizational inclusion initiatives that address the complex interrelationships between ethnicity and neurodiversity.</content>

    <title>The King Is Dead – Long Live Who? A Family and Firm Embeddedness Perspective on Succession after the CEO‐Owner's Sudden Death</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When the CEO‐owner of an SME suddenly dies, who should take over? Integrating the social embeddedness perspective with research on crisis management, we theorize that an SME's financial health gets progressively worse before it stabilizes and recovers, reflecting an inverse U‐shaped relationship between time since the CEO‐owner's sudden death and an SME's financial distress. We then explore how successors' family and firm embeddedness moderate this relationship. Using a longitudinal sample of Swedish SMEs, we find general support for our theorizing. While nonfamily successors lead to less financial distress than family successors immediately following a CEO‐owner's sudden death, the opposite occurs in the long term. Further, successors with high firm embeddedness are associated with less financial distress than those with low firm embeddedness in both the short‐ and long‐term. Additionally, our post‐hoc analyses reveal that successors with high firm embeddedness, independent of their family embeddedness, outperform those low in firm embeddedness. Family successors lacking firm embeddedness report the highest financial distress, whereas family successors with high firm embeddedness experience the lowest. Our social embeddedness perspective on succession after the CEO‐owner's sudden death therefore contends that successor embeddedness explains differences in an SME's financial health, with the importance of successor firm tenure overshadowing the effect of family status.</content>

    <title>Flexible Revenue-Sharing Contract in a Digital-Content Supply Chain Under Heterogeneous Beliefs of the Parties</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the design of a novel, flexible revenue-sharing contract between a platform and an app developer (or other digital content provider) when the parties hold heterogeneous beliefs with regard to the future income. The current contracts adopted by platforms in reality invoke a policy of two or three commission levels based on historical revenue data. We design a contract in which the commission is a continuous function of the revenue generated by the app or other digital content within the current period. In contrast to the majority of prior studies in operations management, which analyze the homogeneous beliefs scenario, we introduce heterogeneous beliefs, which turn out to be a crucial consideration in designing the contract structure. We use game theory and calculus of variations to derive the conditions to be satisfied by the flexible contract. Two criteria are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed flexible contract: the benefit gained by each party and the complexity of the negotiation (measured by the number of contract terms). The best linear contract serves as a performance benchmark. We show that the flexible contract has the potential to enhance the relationship between platforms and digital content providers. In particular, using extensive numerical analysis (based on 99,225 instances in a full factorial design), we demonstrate that the proposed contract may yield an improvement in expected profits of more than 100% compared with the best linear contract, and we identify the conditions under which the flexible contract achieves a substantial improvement relative to the benchmark. Moreover, the flexible contract outperforms the best linear contract in 99% of cases—the former is either more profitable while entailing the same level of negotiation complexity, or it has the same profitability but a lower level of negotiation complexity. In the remaining 1% of studied cases, the flexible contract is preferable in terms of profitability, but the best linear contract involves less negotiation friction, such that neither contract dominates the other. Based on real data, we demonstrate the applicability and advantages of the flexible contract for a scenario within the video games industry.</content>

    <title>Are non‐economic goals and financial performance friends or foes in hybrid ventures? A duality perspective on academic spin‐offs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study draws on the behavioral theory of the firm and a duality perspective to investigate the impact of founders' focus on academic goals on the financial performance of academic spin‐offs (ASOs)—a specific type of hybrid venture. We theorize that such relationship follows an inverse U‐shaped curve and is moderated by the degree of academic ownership. These hypotheses are tested using a sample of 179 Italian ASOs. Our findings indicate that when academic ownership is low, the relationship displays an inverted U‐shape. Moreover, as academic ownership increases, the relationship flattens and eventually shifts to a U‐shape. These results challenge the prevailing notion of inherent conflicts between economic and non‐economic logics in hybrid ventures, demonstrating when focusing on non‐economic (e.g., academic) goals enhances financial outcomes.Managerial SummaryAcademic spin‐offs (ASOs) play a pivotal role in science commercialization and often pursue academic goals due to their academic origins. However, the extent to which founders' focus on academic goals benefits or hinders ASOs' financial performance has remained largely underexamined. In this study of 179 Italian ASOs, we investigate the relationship between a focus on academic goals and firm performance. Our findings reveal that at lower levels of academic ownership, a moderate focus on academic goals is optimal for ASOs' financial performance. Conversely, at higher levels of academic ownership, either a low or high focus on academic goals proves optimal for financial performance. These insights can help practitioners improve ASO performance by aligning goal and ownership structures.</content>

    <title>How government procurement shapes corporate climate disclosures, commitments, and actions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how government procurement impacts firms’ environmental disclosures and whether they have tangible effects. Using a triple-difference research design that exploits the exogenous increase in federal funding allocations to counties based on population census revisions, we find that firms with high exposure to government contracts significantly increase climate disclosure following expanded procurement opportunities. We also document that enhanced disclosure is characterized by a positive tone that emphasizes firms’ green investment and commitment to climate adaptation. The effect is more pronounced in counties with a greater increase in procurement volume and when firms have lower ex ante sustainability performance. Finally, we find firms that increase climate disclosure are more likely to earn government contracts, and they undertake real actions by reducing toxic emissions and enhancing the development of green products. Overall our results suggest government procurement promotes corporate climate responsibility by incentivizing firms to undertake climate mitigation actions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I develop a model of the social construction of race. Racial categories emerge from labour conflict when elites privilege intrinsically irrelevant traits to divide workers against each other and extract workers’ surplus. I show that elites use colour to grant unequal rights and track these rights across generations because it is heritable, observable, and relatively immutable. Depending on the demographic conditions the elites face, the system of racialization manifests either as ‘ancestry-based’ or ‘colour-based’ categories. This approach to the social construction of race provides a unified explanation of skin tone inequality, racial homophily in marriage, the social status of mixed-race people, the ‘psychological wage’ of Jim Crow, and legal restrictions on manumission. I test for historical variations in racial boundaries using census data from the United States and Brazil and for differential patterns of skin tone inequality between ancestry-based and colour-based systems using survey data from across the Americas.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A longstanding and influential view in U.S. correctional policy is that “nothing works” when it comes to rehabilitating incarcerated individuals. We revisit this hypothesis by studying an innovative law-enforcement-led program launched in the county jail of Flint, Michigan: Inmate Growth Naturally and Intentionally Through Education (IGNITE). We develop an instrumental variable approach to estimate the effects of IGNITE exposure, leveraging quasi-random court delays that cause individuals to spend more time in jail both before and after the program’s launch. Holding time in jail fixed, we find that one additional month of IGNITE exposure reduces weekly misconduct within jail by 25% and three-month recidivism by 24%, with the recidivism effects growing over time. Surveys of staff and community members, along with administrative test score records and within-jail text messages, suggest that cultural change and improved literacy and numeracy scores are contributing mechanisms.</content>

    <title>Revealed Wisdom of the Crowd: Bids Predict Loan Quality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the popularity of the phrase “wisdom of the crowd,” not all crowds are wise because not everyone in them acts in an informed, rational manner. Identifying informative actions, therefore, can help to isolate the truly wise part of a crowd. Motivated by this idea, we evaluate the informational value of investors’ bids using data from online, debt-based crowdfunding, in which we were able to track both investment decisions and ultimate repayment statuses for individual loans. We propose several easily scalable variables derived from the heterogeneity of investors’ bids in terms of size and timing. We first show that loans funded with larger bids relative to the typical bid amount in the market or to the bidder’s historical baseline, particularly early in the bidding period, are less likely to default. More importantly, we perform theory-driven feature engineering and find that these variables improve the predictive performance of state-of-the-art models that have been proposed in this context. Even during the fundraising process, these variables improve predictions of both funding likelihood and loan quality. We discuss the implications of these variables, including loan pricing in secondary markets, crowd wisdom in different market mechanisms, and financial inclusion. Crowdfunding platforms can easily implement these variables to improve market efficiency without compromising investor privacy.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, information systems.Funding: We gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Business Analytics Center in the Scheller College of Business and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02575 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a novel 15-year data set on surgeon adoption of a complex surgical innovation in the English National Health Service and an identification strategy based on surgeon mobility, this paper disentangles three channels of coworker influence on innovation diffusion: (1) peer network size, (2) influential “key players,” and (3) cumulative peer adoption. We find that a one standard deviation in peer connections boost innovation by 16%. Key players can either amplify or dampen diffusion, and peer adoption has a greater impact on less experienced individuals. These results highlight the value of targeting training to high impact network members to speed up diffusion. This work advances our understanding of how professional networks shape innovation diffusion, with implications for technology implementation.This paper was accepted by Stefan Scholtes, healthcare management.Funding: This work was supported by the European Research Council (ANR-17-EURE-0010, POEMH, Advanced Investigator Award HealthCareLabour REP-SCI-788529), the Australian Research Council (Discovery Project DP220101043) and the Health Foundation (Efficiency Research Programme).Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00496 .</content>

    <title>Designing Information to Engage Customers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Collaborative customization is common in many markets. Sellers and customers can collectively discover the value of the product’s basic design. Customers’ willingness to pay can also be increased by being engaged to improve the product design. We study how a seller can design the information structure of collective learning about the product’s basic value to induce costly customer engagement. We consider a setting in which the parties’ expected payoffs are determined endogenously through the strategic interaction between seller pricing and customer engagement and purchase. The customer tends to be engaged in equilibrium, as the uncertainty on the product’s basic value becomes higher to dilute the responsiveness of the optimal price to customer engagement. Therefore, the seller seeks to maximize the probability of generating an intermediate posterior belief. Thus, the optimal information design involves either exaggerating or downplaying the product’s basic value when the prior is low or high, respectively. We show that considering restrictive information structures can generate qualitatively different implications. We also examine how the unobservability of engagement may influence the parties’ strategic interaction, their expected payoffs, and the seller-optimal information design. Interestingly, unobservability may lead to lower equilibrium engagement, hurt the seller, render the customer’s equilibrium expected payoff to increase as customer engagement becomes less important or more costly, and yield more or less information provision.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper robustly concludes that it cannot. A model is constructed under idealized conditions that presume that the risks associated with artificial general intelligence (AGI) are real, that safe AGI products are possible, and that there exist socially minded funders who are interested in funding safe AGI, even if this does not maximize profits. It is demonstrated that a socially minded entity formed by such funders would not be able to minimize harm from AGI that unrestricted products released by for-profit firms might create. The reason is that a socially minded entity can only minimize the use of unrestricted AGI products in ex post competition with for-profit firms at a prohibitive financial cost and so, does not preempt the AGI developed by for-profit firms ex ante.This paper was accepted by Maria Guadalupe, business strategy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One may reasonably think that cultural homophily, defined as the tendency to associate with others of similar culture, affects collaboration in multinational teams in general but not in superstar teams of professionals at the top of their industry. The analysis of an exhaustive data set on the passes made by professional European football players in the top five men’s leagues reveals that on the contrary, cultural homophily is persistent, pervasive, and consequential, even in superstar multinational teams of very-high-skill individuals with clear common objectives and aligned incentives who are involved in interactive tasks that are well defined and not particularly culture intensive.This paper was accepted by Olav Sorenson, organizations.Funding: G.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop an extensive mapping of the revolving door phenomenon by examining the work experience of 420,153 individuals in top corporate positions at 12,869 firms. More than half of these firms have at least one such individual with prior experience in one of 187 executive branch agencies. We find that firms are more likely to receive procurement contracts following the appointment of a former regulator transitioning within 2 years of leaving the agency, a result consistent with the “knowledge” hypothesis. Less-complex contracts signed following the appointment of former regulators are more likely to be renegotiated, increasing costs for the government.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using transaction-level trade data from China Customs and loan data from the China Development Bank (CDB), we find that CDB credit to strategic industries at the top of supply chains leads to lower prices, higher volume, and more product varieties and destinations for exports for firms in downstream industries. These positive spillovers stem from reduced intermediate goods prices and increased trade credit from upstream to downstream firms caused by CDB loans. Notably, this surge in import activity displaces U.S. firms within the same industry but bolsters downstream U.S. firms’ business performance and employment.</content>

    <title>Crowdfunding Success for Female Versus Male Entrepreneurs Depends on Whether a Consumer Versus Investor Decision Frame Is Salient</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ensuring equal access to entrepreneurship and startup funding for both female and male entrepreneurs is crucial for societal perceptions of justice and long-term prosperity. Previous research presents contrasting findings, with some studies indicating a male advantage and others suggesting a female advantage. This research reconciles these inconsistencies by identifying the decision frame as a moderator. Specifically, in crowdfunding contexts, a consumer decision frame leads to stronger reliance on communal evaluation norms, resulting in favoring female entrepreneurs who are perceived as more disadvantaged. Conversely, an investor decision frame leads to stronger reliance on exchange evaluation norms, resulting in favoring male entrepreneurs who are perceived as more determined/passionate. Based on this, the authors propose that the strategic use of an entrepreneur's profile, activating a specific evaluation norm, and showing crowdfunding dependence attenuate the differential support for female versus male entrepreneurs, resulting in equal support for both. Results from six studies using a multimethod design provide converging support for this framework. This research is the first to differentiate between and directly compare consumer and investor decision frames, advancing the related literature and offering valuable guidelines for entrepreneurs, funding platforms, and public policy makers.</content>
