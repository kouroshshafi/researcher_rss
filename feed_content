    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide experimental evidence of a positive memory bias that affects individuals’ beliefs, decisions to reinvest, and overconfidence in the stock market. Individuals overremember positive investment outcomes of chosen assets and underremember negative ones. Based on their memories, subjects form overly optimistic beliefs about their investment, reinvest too much, and become overconfident about their investment ability relative to others. We further provide evidence on motivation driving the memory bias. This positive memory bias offers a cognitive microfoundation for why gains weight more than losses when people learn from experiences. This helps reconcile various stylized facts in investor beliefs and behavior. (JEL D01, G4)</content>

    <title>Voting on a Trade Agreement: Firm Networks and Attitudes Towards Openness</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We exploit a unique event to study the extent to which popular attitudes towards trade are driven by economic fundamentals. In 2007, Costa Rica put a free trade agreement (FTA) to a national referendum. With a single question on the ballot, 59% of Costa Rican adult citizens cast a vote on whether they wanted an FTA with the U.S. to be ratified or not. We merge disaggregated referendum results, which break new ground on anonymity-compatible voting data, with employer–employee, customs, and firm-to-firm transactions data, and data on household composition and expenditures. We document that a firm’s exposure to the FTA, directly and via input–output linkages, significantly influences the voting behaviour of its employees. This effect dominates that of sector-level exposure and is greater for voters aligned with pro-FTA political candidates. We also show that citizens considered the expected decrease in consumer prices when exercising their vote. Overall, economic factors explain 7% of the variation in voting patterns, which cannot be accounted for by non-economic factors such as political ideology, and played a pivotal role in this vote.</content>

    <title>Inventory and Supply Chain Planning Systems as Drivers of Supply Chain Resilience: Analyses of Firm Performance Through the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We combine insights from information processing theory (IPT), supply chain resilience literature, and collaboration with a leading supply chain planning technology provider to study the effects of excess inventory (a buffering tactic) and usage of supply chain planning systems (SCPSs) (a bridging technology) on supply chain resilience. Utilizing the exogenous disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as the setting for quasi-natural experiments, we compare profit impact and time-to-recover across manufacturing firms that operated with varied levels of inventory and SCPS use in the period leading up to the onset of the pandemic. The results of multiple tests provide no evidence that inventory buffering aided firms in being more resilient, even for firms in industries that experienced positive demand shocks during the pandemic. In contrast, we find that firms that used SCPS evidenced fewer negative financial impacts throughout the disruptive period, and they recovered faster than their peers. The results are robust to sample characteristics, time frame, and control-group matching procedures. Our study extends a growing literature on supply chain resilience by offering a more refined explanation of IPT in a disruptive context, highlighting the limitations of inventory as a buffering tactic, and describing how SCPSs help planners cope with uncertainty and disruptions. In addition, interviews with managers from a leading SCPS provider and from user firms highlight specific ways in which SCPSs provide faster and more effective responses to disruptions. We discuss the implications of these findings for future research.</content>

    <title>Startup Accelerators, Information Asymmetry, and Corporate Venture Capital Investments</title>
    <updated>2025-03-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Beyond financial incentives, investments by Corporate Venture Capitalists (CVCs) are often motivated by strategic objectives, such as gaining early exposure to emerging technologies. However, in the presence of information asymmetry, CVCs tend to invest in startups with a high degree of business relatedness—startups that are less risky but lacking in knowledge novelty—which are not ideal for achieving their strategic objectives. With startup accelerators showing promise in mitigating the information asymmetry problem, we examine how a CVC’s investment pattern in a region shifts following a startup accelerator’s entry, with a particular interest in the degree of business relatedness between the CVC’s parent corporation and its portfolio companies. Analyses reveal that CVCs increase investments in startups that are dissimilar to their parent’s business following the entry of startup accelerators. We show that the two pathways through which accelerators reduce information asymmetry—quality signals, and mentorship and training—likely contribute to this change. In addition, the change is most pronounced for CVCs whose parent firm operates in an IT-using—rather than an IT-producing—industry, suggesting that accelerators help IT-using firms gain a foothold in the technology space through CVC investments. These findings deepen the understanding of the role that startup accelerators play in the entrepreneurial ecosystem against the backdrop of digital transformation occurring in nearly every industry.This paper was accepted by Kartik Hosanagar, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.03494 .</content>

    <title>Strategic Liquidity Provision and Extreme Volatility Spikes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We test competing theories of liquidity dynamics during extreme volatility spikes (EVSs). We find that liquidity providers strategically allow for price pressures and are compensated from correcting pricing errors. As a result, liquidity provision intensifies toward the end of a typical EVS. This goes counter to a widespread concern that market-making constraints cause liquidity to deteriorate as EVSs develop. The prevailing limit order book dynamics during EVSs are in line with the socially beneficial equilibrium presented in the theoretical literature.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.04104 .</content>

    <title>Shaping Police Officer Mindsets and Behaviors: Experimental Evidence of Procedural Justice Training</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on organizational justice shows that perceptions of justice by internal and external agents are reliable predictors of key organizational outcomes. But how can we promote the enactment of fair behavior by those with decision-making authority within organizations? This is particularly important for organizations that depend on frequent client interactions, in which individual discretion is required to make consequential decisions, and where necessary evils are unavoidable. Few organizations face this challenge as intensely as police forces, in which misconduct and bad decisions by their street-level bureaucrats can have large negative consequences. This paper analyzes whether police officers can be trained to effectively incorporate the principles of procedural justice in their interactions with citizens. In collaboration with the Mexico City police, we implemented a randomized controlled trial with 1,854 officers to measure whether procedural justice training changed their perceptions of policing and actual behavior on the field. We find significant and positive effects of the training across all measures of the procedural justice model. Our research yields insights into critical elements to consider in organizational training programs, including managerial alignment with the objectives of the training and a consideration of employees’ perceptions of the extent to which their work is understood by others.This paper was accepted by Isabel Fernandez-Mateo, organizations.Funding: This research was funded by the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) [Grant SINLEC17CA2007].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03243 .</content>

    <title>Online Stochastic Optimization with Wasserstein-Based Nonstationarity</title>
    <updated>2025-03-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a general online stochastic optimization problem with multiple resource constraints over a horizon of finite time periods. In each time period, a reward function and multiple cost functions are revealed, and the decision maker needs to specify an action from a convex and compact action set to collect the reward and consume the resources. Each cost function corresponds to the consumption of one resource. The reward function and the cost functions of each time period are drawn from an unknown distribution, which is nonstationary across time. The objective of the decision maker is to maximize the cumulative reward subject to the resource constraints. This formulation captures a wide range of applications including online linear programming and network revenue management, among others. In this paper, we consider two settings: (i) a data-driven setting where the true distribution is unknown but a prior estimate (possibly inaccurate) is available and (ii) an uninformative setting where the true distribution is completely unknown. We propose a unified Wasserstein distance–based measure to quantify the inaccuracy of the prior estimate in setting (i) and the nonstationarity of the environment in setting (ii). We show that the proposed measure leads to a necessary and sufficient condition for the attainability of a sublinear regret in both settings. For setting (i), we propose an informative gradient descent algorithm. The algorithm takes a primal-dual perspective, and it integrates the prior information of the underlying distributions into an online gradient descent procedure in the dual space. The algorithm also naturally extends to the uninformative setting (ii). Under both settings, we show the corresponding algorithm achieves a regret of optimal order. We illustrate the algorithm’s performance through numerical experiments.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.03850 .</content>

    <title>Methods and Theory for Using Parcels in Management Research: An Overview and Guide for Improved Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research questions and subsequent methodology in the field of management continue to evolve, bringing about more complex models and heightened data requirements and considerations. Thus, the difficulties associated with meeting the requirements of growing methodological rigor (e.g., increasing sample size) have influenced scholars to develop procedures aimed at mitigating these challenges. One such practice is parceling or combining subsets of scale items to form composite indicators of latent variables. Since introduced, parceling approaches have proliferated in a piecemeal fashion, leading to inconsistencies and inaccuracies regarding how parceling is both conducted and reported. With limited consensus about how to parcel, scholars risk perpetuating disjointed, incomplete, or errant approaches that confound the quality of research, accenting the need for a review that organizes the concept of parceling. In response, we offer an examination of parceling in management research with the aim of offering much-needed insight and instruction. To accomplish this, we provide insights that include an overview of parceling from practical and theoretical standpoints, needed clarification surrounding the importance of construct dimensionality when parceling, and robust, informed insights into best practices to aid future researchers in appropriately crafting and reporting on parceling moving forward.</content>

    <title>Consumptive Work in Coworking: Using Consumption Strategically for Work</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumption has always been part of the workplace, yet it has traditionally been seen as nonwork—an activity that depletes rather than creates value. In the knowledge and digital economy, however, consumption and work are becoming increasingly intertwined, calling for a relational perspective on consumption’s productive role. We develop this perspective through a four-year ethnography of coworking spaces across Paris and London, supplemented by post-pandemic archival data. We introduce consumptive work as the instrumentalization of consumption activities in the workplace to generate productive value. Consumptive work emerges within a postindustrial societal context where workplace culture is shaped by consumer ideology, leading to 1) customer entitlement in the workplace, 2) consumer desire toward the workplace, and 3) consumer lifestyle aspirations toward work. Consumptive work is characterized by inconspicuousness, boundarilessness, and communal and market exchange. While it can be empowering, it also fosters neo-normative alienation, particularly through performative play and leisure, and the pursuit of productive wellness. Ultimately, consumptive work reinforces evolving consumer desires and aspirations about office work and workplaces. This study advances interdisciplinary research on consumption and consumption ideology in the workplace, workplace alienation, new ways of working, and consumer research connecting work, home, and leisure.</content>

    <title>Matching Queues with Abandonments in Quantum Switches: Stability and Throughput Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Researchers have developed a novel model inspired by quantum switches to address the complexities of matching requests for entangled qubits in a discrete-time system. The study examines two types of arrivals: requests for entangled qubits between nodes and qubits supplied by nodes, which are subject to decoherence over time. Unlike classical queueing models, this system features server-less multiway matching and correlated abandonments, posing unique analytical challenges. By applying a max-weight policy, the researchers characterized the system’s stability using a two-time-scale fluid limit to account for qubit abandonments. They demonstrated that the max-weight policy is throughput optimal, outperforming nonidling policies under certain conditions. Intriguingly, the study revealed counterintuitive behavior: The longest request queue may grow temporarily, even in a stable system. These findings offer new insights into managing quantum-inspired systems with practical constraints, opening avenues for further research into quantum network optimization.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In a tender offer by a value increasing raider, voting shareholders face a free-rider problem. However, when they are not atomistic, they do not completely free-ride. In contrast, non-voting shareholders, who are never pivotal for the success of the offer, are absolute free-riders. Hence in this case there is a gain from departing from one share/one vote. This departure also has a cost; there is an increased vulnerability to value decreasing raiders, and the optimal governance structure balances the cost and the gain.</content>

    <title>CEO Turnover, Sequential Disclosure and Stock Returns</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document that firms experience large negative stock returns during, and positive returns following, the first informational events after forced CEO turnovers. This V-shaped return pattern is driven by the strategic sequential disclosure of bad news and good news, aligned with incoming CEOs’ incentives to manage expectations. The pattern is more pronounced when these incentives are stronger, such as when firms earn higher stock returns and have higher valuation uncertainty leading up to the informational events. Evidence from firms’ earnings surprises, analysts’ forecast revisions, and large language model-based measures of disclosure behavior indicates that incoming CEOs often initially release bad news about realized and short-term earnings, projecting a broadly pessimistic outlook for the firm’s future performance, and subsequently disclose favorable news about longer-term earnings prospects. Our findings suggest that investors make the costly mistake of failing to discern the incentives behind managers’ disclosure.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using unique data on Italian households from 2011–2015, we examine how investor demand-side and bank supply-side characteristics relate to households’ holdings of bonds issued by their own bank. Households with a higher concentration of own bank bonds tend to have a lower education level, a shorter investment horizon, and less wealth. Controlling for investment and investor attributes, households exhibit high bank bond concentration when the issuing bank has high funding needs, low profitability, or a high branch market share. Furthermore, we show that a buy-and-hold strategy on bank bonds yields lower returns than one on government bonds over the same period. These findings offer insights into retail bond issuance, an important source of funding for banks in times of market stress.</content>

    <title>Voluntary Minimum Wages: The Local Labor Market Effects of National Retailer Policies</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Low unionization rates, a falling real federal minimum wage, and outsourcing have hampered wage growth in the low-wage sector in the US for several decades. In recent years (2014-2023), a number of large private retailers – including some of the largest employers in the U.S. – have opted to institute or raise company-wide, voluntary minimum wages (VMWs) for their employees. We use anonymized payroll data from a large credit bureau and a major payroll provider to study the effects of these national retailer policies on adopting employers’ own wages and employment as well as their spillovers to other employers in shared local labor markets, variously defined. Using stacked event studies centered around multiple VMW events and a continuous treatment variable defined as the gap between local area wages and the company minimum, we find that VMWs result in sizable wage increases and reductions in turnover at the companies that implemented them. Turning to wages at other companies, we estimate small, often economically negligible, spillover effects across multiple measures of exposure to VMWs and numerous definitions of relevant competitors, including firms connected by worker flows. Together, the evidence points to little role for strategic interactions in the transmission of large retailers’ wage policies to other firms. Voluntary minimum wage policies have affected over 3 million jobs at adopting employers, yet their impact on the broader labor market is limited.</content>

    <title>Unit Commitment Without Commitment: A Dynamic Programming Approach for Managing an Integrated Energy System Under Uncertainty</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Building Flexibility into Energy System DispatchThe growing use of renewable energy is forcing power system operators to grapple with increasing uncertainty and intermittency in their energy supplies and demands. In “Unit Commitment without Commitment: A Dynamic Programming Approach for Managing an Integrated Energy System Under Uncertainty,” Brown and Smith develop a dynamic programming (DP) framework for balancing supply and demand over time. The approach introduces stochastic Lagrange multipliers as surrogate energy prices, which reduces the system-wide DP to a collection of unit-specific DPs, where each unit is managed to maximize its expected profit over a long time horizon, given these uncertain prices. Real-time dispatch decisions are then made using the unit-specific value functions to capture the longer-term impacts of the dispatch decisions. Using data from the Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress systems, this new approach reduced operational costs by 2% in current systems and 4%–5% in example future scenarios with increased solar and storage capabilities. Strikingly, the proposed methods performed within 0.2%–0.3% of plans based on perfect foresight, across a wide variety of scenarios.</content>

    <title>Statistical Tests for Replacing Human Decision Makers with Algorithms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a statistical framework of using artificial intelligence to improve human decision making. The performance of each human decision maker is benchmarked against that of machine predictions. We replace the diagnoses made by a subset of the decision makers with the recommendation from the machine learning algorithm. We apply both a heuristic frequentist approach and a Bayesian posterior loss function approach to abnormal birth detection using a nationwide data set of doctor diagnoses from prepregnancy checkups of reproductive-age couples and pregnancy outcomes.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider the placement, delivery promise, and fulfillment decisions of an online retailer. We have a set of products with given numbers of units to be placed at capacitated fulfillment centers. Once we make the placement decisions, we face demands for the products arriving from different demand regions randomly over time. In response to each demand, we pick a delivery promise to offer, which determines the probability that the demand converts into sales as well as choose a fulfillment center to use to serve the demand. Our goal is to decide where to place the units at the beginning of the selling horizon and to find a policy to make delivery promise and fulfillment decisions over the selling horizon so that we maximize the total expected profit. We give an approximation strategy to obtain solutions with performance guarantees for this joint placement, delivery promise, and fulfillment problem. In our approximation strategy, we construct a bounding function that upper bounds the total expected profit from the delivery promise and fulfillment policy when viewed as a function of the placement decisions. To make the placement decisions, we maximize the bounding function subject to the capacity constraints at the fulfillment centers. To make the delivery promise and fulfillment decisions, we construct a policy that obtains a constant fraction of the bounding function. Using our approximation strategy with appropriate bounding functions, we obtain a solution with a constant factor performance guarantee, but if the size of the system, measured by the numbers of units that we need to place and capacities of the fulfillment centers, is large, then we get an asymptotically optimal solution. We compare our approximation strategy with approaches that ignore the interactions between the placement, delivery promise, and fulfillment decisions as well as heuristics that are based on Lagrangian relaxation, demonstrating that our approximation strategy compares quite favorably.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Funding: The work of the first and third authors was partly supported by the National Science Foundation Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation [Grant CMMI-2226900].

    <title>Organizational Culture, Innovation, and Competitive Performance: A Multilevel Dynamic Model</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a dynamic evolutionary model of innovation culture and its organizational effects at three levels. At the frontline level, informal bottom-up innovation ideas are driven by unplanned interactions governed by cultural norms, as frontline employees sort themselves into idea generator or implementor behaviors. Management cannot directly control innovation interactions and thus culture, but it can imperfectly nudge it by influencing a sharing norm at the second level. At the third level, the culture influences the innovation performance and productivity of the firm and is thus relevant for the organization’s competitiveness. This modeling approach disentangles how top-down strategy interacts with implicit frontline dynamics of cultural evolution, in the context of innovation. Unguided culture does not lead to maximum firm performance. Management guidance may or may not improve performance, and industry competition may select higher-performing cultures, which then spread through the industry under some circumstances. We characterize under which conditions management has a strong influence on culture and performance and under which conditions performance is driven more by forces outside of management’s control.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05087 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present evidence that loan allocations and loan terms are closely linked to the strength of social connections between bank and borrower regions. Lending increases with social connectedness, particularly in the presence of strong screening incentives. If connectedness is high, banks discriminate between borrowers more, the terms of originated loans are more borrower friendly, and loan performance is better. Furthermore, social connectedness is associated with higher bank profitability and with lending-related increases in borrower-region GDP growth and employment. Our results suggest that lending barriers decrease with social connectedness, which helps our understanding of geographic lending patterns and regional economic disparities.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present a model rationalizing the economic value of digital tokens for launching peer-to-peer platforms. By using the blockchain to transparently distribute tokens before the platform launches, a token sale overcomes later coordination failures between the platform’s users. This result follows from forward induction reasoning, under which the costly and observable action of token acquisition credibly communicates the intent to participate on the platform. Our framework demonstrates the applications of digital tokens to entrepreneurship, and offers guidance for both practitioners and regulators. (JEL C72, C73, L26, D85, G23)</content>

    <title>Beefing IT Up for Your Investor? Engagement with Open Source Communities, Innovation, and Startup Funding: Evidence from GitHub</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the engagement of nascent firms with open source communities and its implications for innovation and attracting funding. To do so, we link data on 160,065 U.S. startups from Crunchbase to their activities on the open source software development platform GitHub. In a matched sample of firms with and without GitHub activities, difference-in-differences models reveal a substantial increase in the likelihood of being funded after early stage startups engage with open source communities on GitHub. This relationship is weaker for firms that employ GitHub for internal development only. Startups developing novel technologies tend to benefit more from engaging with open source communities, unlike those in highly competitive environments. This heterogeneity highlights a potential trade-off between engaging with open source communities and appropriability. To provide insight regarding mechanisms, we classify startups’ technology use-cases on GitHub using machine learning and exploit data on product launches. Our results from these additional analyses support the notion that one important channel potentially driving our findings is the access to external knowledge for technology development provided by open source communities. Engaging with these communities may thereby aid startups in innovating and creating a (minimum) viable product.Funding: A. Conti and C.

    <title>Design- and Theory-Based Approaches to Strategic Decisions</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a unified framework to examine the implications of two primary approaches to strategic decision making under uncertainty: designing and shaping future scenarios vis-à-vis testing theories about future scenarios. We conducted a three-arm randomized controlled trial involving 308 early stage entrepreneurs, dividing them into three groups—design-based training, theory-based training, and a control group—and tracked them over approximately 1.5 years. Our findings reveal that both approaches reduce the need for information in decision making and lead to higher commitment rates. The design-based approach encourages action despite negative beliefs, resulting in less frequent and later project termination. In contrast, the theory-based approach promotes a more conservative termination rule, leading to earlier and more frequent project abandonment. Although the theory-based approach is associated with higher average performance upon survival, the design-based approach fosters breakthroughs for decision makers. In sum, the design-based approach is well-suited for innovative ventures that gather information to shape their environment, whereas the theory-based approach is optimal for pursuing high performance under lower degrees of uncertainty.Funding: The research leading to these results has received funding from the Italian Ministry for Education, “Entrepreneurs as Scientists: When and How Start-ups Benefit from a Scientific Approach to Decision Making” project [Grant PRIN 2017, Prot. 2017PM7R52, CUP J44I20000220001].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.18245 .</content>

    <title>Project Networks and Reallocation Externalities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A project involves several participants—including clients, contractors, and subcontractors—that work concurrently on multiple projects and allocate resources among them. This interdependency creates a network of otherwise-unrelated projects. We map the network of U.S. government projects involving over 150,000 participants. We show that a seemingly localized disruption, affecting only one project site, eventually causes delays across unrelated projects. This is because participants opportunistically reallocate resources into disrupted projects, at the expense of other projects, triggering a domino effect of further reallocations in the network. Thus, the costs of on-site disruptions end up being shared by multiple participants in the network, rather than being fully absorbed by the affected project. Performance-based incentives, which reward contractors for timeliness, exacerbate these externalities by encouraging self-interested resource reallocation.This paper was accepted by Karan Girotra, operations management.Funding: This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [Grant RGPIN-2017-04523].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01574 .</content>

    <title>Routine and Innovative Use of Enterprise System: Intricacy of Change Management Levers, System Characteristics, and Regulatory Focus</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study explores how organizational contexts, system design, and individual differences shape employees’ use of enterprise systems (ESs) and their impact on job outcomes. By examining leadership styles (transactional versus transformational), support structures (impersonal versus personal), and system characteristics (modularity and complexity), we highlight the role of employees’ situational regulatory focus (prevention versus promotion) in determining routine and innovative use of ES. Our findings show that leadership and support structures affect ES usage through employees’ regulatory focus, with transactional leadership and impersonal support fostering routine use and transformational leadership and personal support encouraging innovative use. System modularity enhances the relationship between prevention focus and routine use, whereas complexity strengthens the link between promotion focus and innovative use but weakens the relationship between prevention focus and routine ES use. Both routine and innovative ES use influence the employees’ job outcomes, including job performance and satisfaction. For organizations, this means that effective change management and ES design should align with employees’ regulatory focus and leadership strategies to maximize system adoption and improve performance. This study offers practical insights for designing more effective ES implementation strategies and tailoring support to boost employee engagement and outcomes.</content>
