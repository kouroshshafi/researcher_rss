    <title>EXPRESS: A Blessing or a Curse: the Impact of Sampling in Crowdfunding Market</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The crowdfunding market has developed fast in recent years. However, the problem of information asymmetry is still an issue for both backers and fundraisers. Hence, crowdfunding platforms design various policies to reveal more project information to backers. This paper studies the impact of product sampling, a novel policy in the crowdfunding market, and provides suggestive evidence of the underlying mechanism. A product sampling campaign can be divided into three stages chronologically. InApplication Stage, backers can apply for free samples. InTrial Stage, users of free samples experience them, but no feedback reports are available. InReport Stage, at least one feedback report is published, and backers can refer to reports when making decisions. Leveraging a rich data set from a large online crowdfunding platform in China, we construct a structural model considering both the demand and supply sides of the market. We use a consideration set model to characterize the fact that backers cannot notice all projects on the crowdfunding platform. We find that sampling campaigns raise the awareness of backers on sampling projects in all stages. However, inTrial Stage, backers’ utility of supporting the project declines, which is most likely to be attributed to backers’ strategic delay waiting for valuable feedback reports. We also find that the scores of feedback reports and the number of free samples offered serve as effective quality signals of projects. These two signals largely determine how backers’ utility changes inReport Stage. Moreover, our counterfactual analysis shows that the demand for most projects rises inApplication Stagebut falls inTrial Stage, and half of the projects see a demand increase inReport Stagewhile the other half experience a decrease. Our research strives to uncover the underlying mechanisms of product sampling in the crowdfunding market, makes methodological contributions, and provides meaningful managerial implications for fundraisers and crowdfunding platforms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze how a profit‐maximizing proxy advisor designs vote recommendations and research reports. The advisor benefits from producing informative, unbiased reports, but only partially informative recommendations, biased against the a priori likely alternative. Such recommendations induce close votes, increasing controversy and thereby the relevance and value of proxy advice. Our results suggest shifting from an exclusive emphasis on recommendations, highlighting the importance of both reports and recommendations in proxy advisors' information provision. They rationalize the one‐size‐fits‐all approach and help reinterpret empirical patterns of voting behavior, suggesting that proxy advisors' recommendations may not be a suitable benchmark for evaluating shareholders' votes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Large Language Models have been incorporated into an astounding breadth of professional domains. Given their capabilities, many intellectual laborers naturally question to what extent these AI models will be able to usurp their own jobs. As behavioral scientists, we performed an effort to examine the extent to which an AI can performourroles. To achieve this, we utilized commercially available AIs (e.g., ChatGPT 4) to perform each step of the research process, culminating in an AI‐written manuscript. We attempted to intervene as little as possible in the AI‐led idea generation, empirical testing, analysis, and reporting. This allowed us to assess the limits of AIs in a behavioral research context and propose guidelines for behavioral researchers wanting to utilize AI. We found that the AIs were adept at some parts of the process and wholly inadequate at others. Our overall recommendation is that behavioral researchers use AIs judiciously and carefully monitor the outputs for quality and coherence. We additionally draw implications for editorial teams, doctoral student training, and the broader research ecosystem.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Below are comments on Tomaino, Cooke, and Hoover by four teams of collaborative reviewers that helped clarify and focus its original version. Their comments on the refined version articulate how the fast‐moving world of generative AI can alter authors, readers, reviewers, and consumer behavior journals. In the first comment, Blythe, Kulis, and McGraw propose that Generative AI requires substantial effort to generate research that is fast, cost‐effective, and of high quality. They articulate three recommendations: to ask, to train, and to check the system.Askingbuilds on GenAI's ability to reveal its own capabilities at different stages of the research process.Trainingallows the system to be customized with relevant context, domain‐specific documents, and tailored examples, enhancing its accuracy and reducing errors.Checkingis strongly advised to validate that the outputs are both reasonable and robust. Haenlein, Hewett, and Yoo build on the capabilities of Large Language Models that go beyond the research practices central to consumer psychology. They outline strategic prompting strategies: starting broadly and gradually narrowing to specific domains, downloading information from relevant articles and data that is unlikely to be part of the current corpus, and evoking specific theories, methods, or presentation formats. They also elaborate on the ways the apparent magic of GenAI may raise learning or ethical challenges. The third comment by Stacy Wood focuses less on the capabilities of GenAI and more on how its adoption will depend on researcher feelings—in other words, how different aspects of its use may alter researchers' experiences of doing research and their identities as scholars. GenAI has the potential to both build (through increased productivity or increased accessibility) and limit (through loss of agency or faster production) pride of purpose in research. She argues that feelings from using GenAI are likely to differ across research steps, from developing novel concepts, processes, analyses, and writing of the paper. Wherever GenAI may lessen the excitement, satisfaction, motivation, and perceived status of the researcher, barriers to its use are likely to be erected. Finally, Vicki Morwitz identifies new AI capabilities beyond those explored in Tomaino et al. Those include the ability to generate synthetic data that can guide empirical experiments, a facility to create audio and visual stimuli, a capability to study group behavior, and a capacity to reliably interpret complex human statements. The comment then closes with important questions for editorial policies, raising issues about limitations on AI use by authors, its appropriate applications by review teams, and possible publishers' restrictions on uploading copyrighted articles.</content>

    <title>How Do Coworkers Interpret Employee &lt;scp&gt;AI&lt;/scp&gt; Usage: Coworkers' Perceived Morality and Helping as Responses to Employee &lt;scp&gt;AI&lt;/scp&gt; Usage</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations are increasingly introducing artificial intelligence (AI) into the workplace and encouraging employees to use AI to complete work. Correspondingly, research on AI usage predominantly focuses on the positive effects of AI usage on employees themselves. Drawing upon attribution theory and AI literature and taking an interpersonal perspective, this research challenges the prevailing consensus by investigating whether, when, and how employee AI usage would lead to negative coworker outcomes. We propose that when coworkers attribute employee AI usage as a way to slack off (i.e., slack attribution), employee AI usage is negatively related to coworkers' perceived morality of the employee, which in turn decreases coworkers' helping behavior toward the employee. Two experimental studies, a field survey study, and a field experiment provide substantial support for our hypotheses. This research adds new insights into the AI usage literature by revealing the negative coworker outcomes of employee AI usage.</content>

    <title>Peer Influence in the Workplace: The Moderating Role of Task Structures Within Organizations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Peer influence is crucial in shaping work practices within organizations, yet the impact of formal organizational structures on this influence remains underexplored. We argue that task structures, which capture how tasks are allocated and configured within organizations, significantly affect peer interactions and influence. Specifically, we examine how two features of task structures—task variety and task similarity with peers—moderate peer influence in a highly consequential setting: physicians’ decisions to perform a birth via caesarean section (C-section) versus vaginal delivery. Using data on nearly 5 million births performed by more than 16,500 physicians across 915 hospitals in Brazil, we find that working alongside peers whose practice style (enduring preference) favors C-sections leads the focal physician to perform more C-sections, even after controlling for features of the mother and the pregnancy. This influence is significantly stronger for physicians with higher task variety and with higher task similarity with peers. Through post-hoc analyses, we provide evidence that the observed behaviors are consistent with a mechanism of information sharing between physicians. This study contributes to our understanding of peer influence in the workplace by showing how the task structure within organizations can either amplify or diminish peer influence. This awareness is particularly crucial for health care organizations in which such dynamics can have life-changing consequences.</content>

    <title>Incumbent response to business model innovation: The role of &lt;scp&gt;CEO&lt;/scp&gt; opportunity framing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore how CEO sensegiving through framing influences incumbent firm response to business model innovation. Our historical analysis of Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble (B&amp;N) in the US bookselling industry after the entry of Amazon.com reveals that although both CEOs framed Amazon's entry as an opportunity, they did so in strikingly different ways. Their opportunity framing differed on four dimensions—intensity, concreteness, future orientation, and inclusiveness—closely associated with specific patterns in the respective incumbent's response: separation between the old and new business model for Borders and blending of the old and new models for B&amp;N. Our study highlights the role of multidimensional and sustained opportunity framing for blending actions contributing to business model innovation in established firms over time.Managerial SummaryWhat role do CEOs play in how established firms react to new entrants with innovative business models? We examined how the CEOs at B&amp;N and Borders framed the opportunity provided by the new online business model introduced by Amazon and found significant differences in their framing that influenced how the two firms adapted to it. The more intense, concrete, future‐oriented, and inclusive framing by B&amp;N's top managers contributed to a successful blending of the traditional store‐based and the new online model, while at Borders the business models were kept separate. Our study shows the importance of multidimensional and sustained framing of digital opportunities over time for the successful integration of new business models.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how the development ofvoluntarysustainability standards has affected the nature of information covered in earnings calls. Using industry-specific dictionaries of sustainability terms contained in the disclosure standards developed by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), we find an increase in coverage of sustainability topics identified as relevant to investors in SASB standards, particularly for companies that had little or no coverage of sustainability issues historically. This trend begins around the time when SASB released aprovisionalstandard for a given company’s industry and continues in the years afterward. We also find a stronger effect of SASB standards on conference call content for companies operating in industries with greater ex ante uncertainty about which sustainability topics are more likely to be financially material. Overall, our paper provides timely evidence as jurisdictions around the world consider whether to support sustainability reporting in their capital markets and, if so, how.</content>

    <title>Blurring Boundaries in Coworker Relationships: How a Nonwork Setting Becomes a Relational Holding Environment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Positive work relationships often emerge when coworkers blur the boundaries of their work and nonwork lives in their interactions. A growing body of scholarship suggests that such boundary blurring increasingly occurs in a variety of nonwork settings. However, existing research has drawn mixed conclusions about whether boundary-blurring interactions in nonwork settings lead to beneficial or detrimental outcomes for coworker relationships. Through an inductive study of users of the exercise platform Peloton, we build theory on how and why a nonwork interaction setting facilitates work-nonwork boundary blurring that leads to positive work relationships. Our findings demonstrate that informants perceive Peloton as having a unique set of characteristics that filters out the discomfort of interacting with coworkers in a nonwork setting and provides them with new ways of understanding the potential of their coworker relationships. These two processes enable Peloton to function as a relational holding environment or — a social context that reduces uncomfortable relational affect and facilitates relational sensemaking. Experiencing Peloton as a relational holding environment motivates informants to deepen their existing positive relationships and forge a broader set of positive relationships across work-related silos. Our theory advances scholarship on work-nonwork boundaries, positive work relationships, and the psychodynamic literature on holding environments. It also has important implications for how managers and employees navigate social contexts to facilitate positive work relationships.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Efficiently Computed Periodic Ordering Heuristics in Stochastic Distribution SystemsThe difficulty of analyzing and optimizing the stochastic one-warehouse multiretailer problem under the (S,T) policy motivates the need to consider approximate but high-fidelity models that are easier to scrutinize. In “Heuristic (S,T) Solutions via an FPTAS for a One-Warehouse Multiretailer Problem,” Najy, Elbassioni, and Diabat show how to efficiently compute competitive solutions for such systems based on an approximate formulation of the inventory problem proposed by Chu and Shen (2010) and build on the assumption of power-of-two (POT) policies. The authors first devise a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the continuous relaxation of the model and then show how to round it to a POT solution within an improved approximation factor relative to the present literature. These solutions are shown via simulation to be highly competitive with optimal (S,T) solutions and are derived in a tiny fraction of the time needed by the current best (S,T) algorithms.</content>

    <title>Contextual Data-Integrated Newsvendor Solution with Operational Data Analytics (ODA)</title>
    <updated>2025-03-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Qi Feng, J. George Shanthikumar, Jian Wu</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the data-integrated newsvendor problem in which the random demand depends on a set of covariates. Observing from the solutions analyzed in the existing studies, we identify the equivariant class of operational statistics (i.e., the mapping from the demand and covariate data to the inventory decision) to develop the operational data analytics (ODA) framework for the contextual newsvendor problem. The equivariant property is intuitively appealing, and it is justified by the fact that, regardless of the sample size, no other decision rule can uniformly dominate the optimal operational statistic within the equivariant class. We also demonstrate that nonequivariant solutions can produce unstable empirical performance with limited samples, whereas equivariant solutions exhibit robustness. When the distribution family of the demand is known but the coefficients of the demand function are unknown, we can directly validate the decision performance of operational statistics within the equivariant class and derive the uniformly optimal solution. When the distribution family of the demand is unknown, we formulate the data integration model as a subclass of equivariant operational statistics, obtained through adaptively boosting some candidate solution. For decision validation, we project the validation data to the demand for the covariates of interests, and the projection is constructed by utilizing the structure of the candidate solution. We demonstrate the superior small-sample performance of adaptive boosting and establish the consistency of the boosted operational statistics. Our ODA formulation, building on the inherent characteristics of the contextual newsvendor problem, highlights the importance of understanding structural properties in data-integrated decision making.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.04164 .</content>

    <title>Incentivizing Blockchain Participation Through Task Assignment Mechanisms: Evidence From a Natural Experiment of Consensus Protocols on Ethereum</title>
    <updated>2025-03-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines how task assignment mechanisms affect the participation of workers on decentralized blockchains. In developing the theory, I highlight that blockchain represents a distinct organizational form for coordinating operations under a highly decentralized structure, in which the essential tasks of system infrastructure maintenance are assigned to third‐party crowd workers through the unique governance mechanism of consensus protocol. I specifically focus on two widely adopted consensus protocols in the context of cryptocurrency, namely, proof‐of‐work (PoW), which assigns tasks that sustain the blockchain system operation based on workers' investments in computing power, and proof‐of‐stake (PoS), which assigns these tasks based on workers' investments in the native cryptocurrency as stakes. I argue that compared with PoW, PoS increases worker participation and task decentralization because the investment requirement of task participation in the form of blockchain native assets reduces workers' transaction costs in task contracting and their tendencies for hyper‐competition. My empirical analysis leverages a natural experiment on Ethereum, namely, the “Merge” event on September 15, 2022, in which the blockchain changed the assignment rules by switching the consensus protocol from PoW to PoS. The results under a difference‐in‐differences research design confirm my arguments.</content>

    <title>Institutional Logics and the Post‐Financing Relationship Between Investors and Entrepreneurs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How the investor–entrepreneur relationship can be better managed and maintained during the post‐financing stage is a central question for investors and entrepreneurs alike, particularly given the large numbers of failed new venture collaborations. Extant research has generally underexplored the two‐sided nature of this process, which requires both investors and entrepreneurs to opt in, while treating the norms and values underlying such behaviours as relatively homogeneous. Drawing on the institutional logics perspective, this study offers an alternative framework to explain the effective maintaining of the crucial investor–entrepreneur relationship. This framework suggests that a similarity in the two parties' institutional logics will facilitate the formation of aligned motives and shared perceptions between investors and entrepreneurs, which helps to maintain the relationship. Moreover, the interaction foundation provided by logic similarity is situated in context, and its activation depends on investment‐ and context‐specific stimuli that can influence investors and entrepreneurs' interpretation and choice of appropriate behaviour. Empirical analyses of 2052 deals made by 1032 investors in 382 portfolio firms during the period 2000–2018 in high‐tech industries in China provide general support for these arguments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present a dynamic model of information acquisition and disclosure. The manager seeks to maximize future stock prices and collects information privately about the firm's fundamentals. Information acquisition increases the arrival rate of private information. The manager can choose to disclose his private information or withhold it in perpetuity. We study the impact of information acquisition on the accumulation of private information, disclosure, and the firm's initial investment.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This registered report investigates self‐directed retail investors' information choices and trading decisions on an integrated trading platform that provides timely and convenient access to accounting information. The analyses reveal that these investors access a mosaic of information, with a high proportion not firm‐specific. In accessing accounting disclosures, retail investors are more interested in media articles providing summaries or expert analyses than original filings. Retail trades on this integrated trading platform are more informed than another retail trading platform providing little information services while exhibiting no significant differences in informativeness compared with institutional trades usingBulge Bracketplatforms. In particular, trade informativeness is more pronounced when there are accounting disclosures. The evidence suggests that self‐directed retail investors can benefit from a trading environment that provides rich and convenient access to a mosaic of information, particularly timely accounting disclosures.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using consumer complaints filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as a measure for the quality of financial products and services, we present evidence of racial disparities in the service quality received by consumers. Consumers in high‐minority communities file more complaints than those in low‐minority communities, and the racial gap in financial complaints increased by more than 60% during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Using a triple‐difference approach, we establish the role of corporate social attitudes, reflected in, for example, inclusive promotion practices and diversity in leadership, in mitigating the complaint racial gap and its pandemic‐period increase. Our results shed light on how inclusive corporate culture filters through an organization to benefit minority communities and underscore the effect of corporate social attitudes on important stakeholder outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Drawing on the organizational identification perspective, this paper proposes that employee‐friendly workplace practices can positively impact employees' innovation productivity through their identification with the organization. Using a sample of 2642 firm‐year observations from public firms in the United States, a positive relationship was found between employee‐friendly workplace practices and employee innovation productivity, which was mediated by identification with the organization. The results also showed that the employee professional human capital dampened the relationship between employee‐friendly workplace practices and employee innovation productivity. Finally, the mediated relationship between employee‐friendly workplace practices and employees' innovation productivity through organizational identification was moderated by employees' professional human capital, such as when employees are credentialed knowledge workers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a tractable dynamic contracting framework to study bank bail-in regimes. In the presence of a repeated monitoring problem, the optimal bank capital structure combines standard debt, which induces liquidation and provides strong incentives, and bail-in debt, which restores solvency but provides weaker incentives. Given fire sales, an optimal policy response entails joint regulation: a bail-in regime reduces standard debt while leverage regulation reduces total debt. Bail-ins replace bailouts as a recapitalization tool. (JEL G28, G33)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide evidence that dividend-paying stocks are less exposed to return extrapolation than non-dividend-paying stocks. In particular, social media sentiment and analyst price targets of dividend-paying stocks are significantly less sensitive to past returns. Our findings indicate that this difference stems from price changes playing a larger role in extrapolation and dividends diverting attention away from price changes for dividend-paying stocks. Consistent with models of return extrapolation, dividend-paying stocks earn lower momentum and long-term reversal returns. The value premium, however, is similar among both groups. Collectively, our findings suggest that return extrapolation is an important source of some anomaly returns.</content>

    <title>Too Long, Didn’t Read? The Impact of Length Limits on Microblogging Engagement</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media platforms aggressively compete for the participants who create content on their sites. In this study, we delve into one tactic of this competition that has become increasingly popular but received limited scholarly attention—the extension of length limits (i.e., the maximum number of characters in a post)—and how it affects both the production and consumption of social media posts. We investigate these questions by exploiting a natural experiment, the phased rollout of length limit extensions on a leading Chinese microblog platform. Findings suggest that extending length limits significantly increased the number of daily posts of individual users. However, and strikingly, only already active users appear to post more after the extension with little observed change from less active users. Further, results show that extending length limits increases the number of likes each post receives, indicating that extensions improve content quality and may increase engagement in the long term. This suggests that, by permitting longer posts, social media platforms can facilitate engagement from both the post generators and audiences (at least in terms of likes). However, findings also suggest that extending length limits risks further concentrating content generation from the vocal minority, thereby making the silent majority less visible on the platforms.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03629 .</content>

    <title>Typical Ranges as Scale-Specific Benchmarks: When and Why Percentages Amplify Relative Magnitudes and Their Differences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Business managers and policymakers must often communicate magnitudes. Yet conveying large relative magnitudes without desensitizing people to further increases can be challenging because of diminishing sensitivity to large numbers. In this research, we propose that percentage expressions not only make large relative magnitudes (e.g., 500%) appear larger than equivalent non-percentage expressions but also make large increases in relative magnitudes (e.g., from 500% to 600%) appear larger. We posit an explanation: percentages typically have values between 0% and 100%, so when percentages and percentage-point differences reach 100% or more, they seem unusually large. This hypothesis is supported by data scraped from New York Times articles and a series of online experiments employing both management-relevant scenarios and incentive-compatible decisions. Existing theories of magnitude perception either cannot predict all the results of these studies (e.g., numerosity and unitosity) or need further specification to do so (e.g., decision-by-sampling and range-frequency theory). We discuss implications for the theory of magnitude and difference perception and the practice of communicating large magnitudes and changes.This paper was accepted by Yuval Rottenstreich, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02646 .</content>

    <title>Integrating Conjoint and Maximum Difference Scaling Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Customer preferences for product features play an important role in designing successful goods and services. Preferences for features are typically obtained by utilizing a model of choice where the utility for all but one level of an attribute is estimable. That is, the traditional discrete choice model can provide information on the change in utility between attribute-levels, but cannot separately estimate the utility associated with all levels of an attribute. In this paper, we propose a model that integrates conjoint and Maximum Difference scaling data to identify part-worth utilities for all product features, using the outside good as a common reference level, instead of the usual practice of having a reference level for each product attribute. The preference data are also integrated with satisfaction data to identify market opportunities for new and existing products. We illustrate our model with data from a survey measuring customer satisfaction and preferences for large-screen TVs.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02560 .</content>

    <title>What Do Content Moderators Do? Emotion Work and Control on a Digital Health Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Content moderation determines the type of data displayed on platforms. Although this type of work is conducted online without interpersonal interactions, it does not remain emotionless. This article presents findings from a longitudinal qualitative study of how content moderation is conducted on a UK‐based platform that publishes patients' stories of their health experiences. Drawing upon the literatures on emotion work in organizations and on content moderation, this paper addresses the questions: what is the nature of emotion work that is undertaken during content moderation and how does emotion work play out with control on online platforms? Although management studies have made extensive contributions to platform work, content moderation remains under‐theorized, despite its significance in determining the type of information platforms exhibit. The paper contributes theoretically and empirically to this field in three ways. First, it categorizes the work practices moderators undertake on a health platform, which encompass application of rules, quantification, objectification, verification, and care. Second, our paper shows that content moderation is constitutive of emotion work and goes on to identify various types of emotion work, including managed and unmanaged authentic emotions. Third, our paper offers a model that illustrates how emotion work constitutes a sense‐making mechanism that allows moderators to exercise discretion and undertake care work, bypassing the prescriptive regulatory environment of content moderation, and sourcing occasional autonomy.</content>

    <title>Manufacturing national consent for industrial policy: a microhistorical analysis of Finnish shipbuilding</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Industrial policy, the use of state power to influence the development of industries, has become increasingly influential in international business, yet its firm-level dynamics remain understudied. Through a history-to-theory approach and microhistorical analysis, we investigate how the Finnish shipbuilding industry employed nonmarket strategies (NMS) to influenceoutward-orientedindustrial policies that supported its international expansion. Grounded in New Institutional Economics, we identify two key industrial policy shifts – in the mid-1950s and early 1980s – that reduced cross-border transaction costs for Finnish shipbuilders to enhance their international competitiveness. Before each shift, the industry proactively aligned its business interests with national policy priorities, engaging in what we term “manufacturing national consent” – positioning the sector as critical to national interests to legitimize supportive policies. We critically assess the double-edged role of NMS in industrial policy, demonstrating that while it creates regulatory capture and hinders alternative economic pathways, it also fosters government–business collaboration, improving the prospects of effective policy design. We further account for country-specific factors and broader inter-country dynamics to analyze policy implications for home-country firms. In all, our study contributes to the revitalization of industrial policy as a topic in the IB discipline by uncovering the active role of firms in shaping policy outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;High commissions in the U.S. residential real estate agency market pose a puzzle for economic theory because brokerage is not a concentrated industry. We model brokered markets as a game in which agents post prices for customers and then choose which other agents to work with. We show that there exists an equilibrium in which each agent conditions working with other agents on those agents' posted prices. Prices can therefore be meaningfully higher than the competitive level (for a fixed discount factor), regardless of the number of agents. Thus, brokered markets can remain uncompetitive even with low concentration and easy entry.</content>

    <title>Supervisor Actions for Supporting Employees Through Stressful Work Situations: A Critical Events Approach From the Perspective of Supervisors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this research, we aim to further our understanding of supervisors' enactment of psychosocial risk management and their own psychological responses to supporting employees through stressful work situations. Informed by event system theorizing and the special case of affective events, we examined 342 employee critical events of a stressful nature through the eyes of the supervisor. Thematic analysis revealed 16 supervisor actions that were aggregated into nine supervisor action themes that supervisors evaluated for stressfulness and effectiveness. Clustering stressfulness and effectiveness scores revealed the emergence of three supervisor groups: favorable, unfavorable, and challenge. Multinomial logistic regressions demonstrated that both organizational and supervisor psychosocial risk management capabilities reduced the odds of supervisors developing unfavorable psychological responses in relation to their supervisor action, whereas supervisors with time pressure and psychological distress had increased odds. In addition, supervisors experiencing psychological distress had a twofold likelihood of experiencing their chosen action as both stressful and effective, calling into question the potential for future benefits to arise from what might be otherwise considered a challenge experience. Overall, our findings demonstrate that pre‐existing features of the supervisor's own psychosocial work environment shape their psychological responses to having enacted psychosocial risk management, irrespective of the type of supervisor action.</content>

    <title>On Resource Complementarity Among Startups, Accelerators, and Financial Investors: A Large-Scale Analysis of Sorting and Value Creation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a theoretical framework and provide empirical evidence on how resource complementarity or substitutability between entrepreneurs and seed investors drives selection and value creation in the context of high-tech startups. Specifically, we argue that seed investors specialized in training programs—startup accelerators—are the ideal match for entrepreneurial teams equipped with strong technological competencies but lacking business knowledge. On the other hand, when entrepreneurs with extensive business knowledge pair up with accelerators, the value created is typically less. Combining information from Crunchbase and LinkedIn, we provide robust empirical evidence based on the assortative matching of start-ups and investors and the ex- post analysis of joint value creation.Funding: S.

    <title>Can Stereotype Reactance Prompt Women to Compete? A Field Experiment</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Women are consistently underrepresented in leadership roles. One contributor may be that women are generally less willing than equally-qualified men to enter competitions (e.g., for jobs or promotions). We draw from research on “stereotype reactance”—the idea that telling people about stereotyped expectations can encourage defiance—to propose and test whether telling women about the gender gap in competition entry can increase their willingness to compete. Our prediction contrasts with prior work on stereotype threat and descriptive norms suggesting that highlighting the gender competition gap might lead women to refrain from competing. In two incentive-compatible, preregistered online experiments, we find that informing women about the gender competition gap increases their likelihood of competing for higher pay, and this effect is mediated by stereotype reactance, consistent with our theorizing. Moreover, exposing both men and women to information about the gender competition gap closes the gap. We then test this informational intervention in a large-scale field experiment on an executive job search platform (n = 4,245), examining whether telling women about the gender competition gap increases their willingness to compete for leadership roles relative to a control message that tells them about an identity-irrelevant competition gap. We find that relative to our control message, informing women about the gender gap in willingness to compete increases submitted job applications by over 20% on the day of condition assignment. This suggests that women’s willingness to compete is affected not just by confidence, but also by cultural expectations and motivation to defy stereotypical norms.Funding: The authors thank the Wharton School (and in particular, the Wharton Behavioral Laboratory and Analytics at Wharton) for funding support.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.19563 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Personalized recommendation systems often face the challenge of making optimal decisions when user preferences are unknown, and outcomes are only observed if users engage with the platform (e.g., clicking a recommendation). In their paper, “Online Learning with Sample Selection Bias,” Singhvi and Singhvi study this problem in the context of sequential decision making, where the censoring of outcomes leads to selection bias. Ignoring this bias results in suboptimal recommendations and linear regret, even for well-performing existing learning algorithms. To address this, they propose the sample selection bandit (SSB) algorithm, which combines Heckman’s two-step estimator with the “optimism under uncertainty” principle. The authors also demonstrate that SSB achieves a near-optimal regret rate. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real-world donation data confirm that SSB significantly outperforms existing algorithms, effectively addressing selection bias while improving recommendations and outcomes in practical settings.</content>

    <title>Consequences of Performance-Enhancing Misconduct: Insights from Professional Road Cycling, 2000–2010</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore the career consequences experienced by professional cyclists implicated in performance-enhancing drug use as well the spillover effects experienced by their teammates and managers using a data set that observes members of all teams from 2000 to 2011. Our data captures publicly known doping implications that range from informal suspicions published in the media to formal convictions by antidoping and law enforcement authorities. Our unique setting, characterized by expectations of widespread doping despite a rigorous antidoping regulatory regime and close media scrutiny, provides a new perspective on the multilayered ways that actors in competitive industries assess the competing demands of extreme performance pressures versus playing by the rules. We find that only the most severe rules violations are associated with career interruptions for riders, whereas lesser offenses are not. More ambiguous cases of doping, those based on informal suspicion or moderately punished formal convictions, are associated with career interruptions primarily for the sport’s high-performing stars. In contrast to most prior work on spillover effects from peer misconduct, we find that most riders are at a lower risk of career interruptions following teammates’ doping convictions—an effect we attribute to a vetting process in which regulators proactively target peers for increased monitoring, which resolves uncertainties about peers’ doping. Regarding spillover effects on managers’ careers, we find that only extreme levels of formal convictions that signal major team scandals are associated with increased risk of managerial career interruptions.

    <title>Estimation Using Marginal Competitor Sales Information</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An abiding preoccupation for firms is understanding how customers value their products versus competitors' products. This is difficult to quantify and estimate from data as, even if competitor prices are public information, their sales are typically unobservable. However, in some industries, most prominently the hotel industry, third‐party information brokers collect and supply aggregate competitor sales information. In the hotel industry, these reports from Smith Travel Research, popularly known as STR reports, are widely subscribed to. Hotels participate by reporting their sales information and, in turn, obtain access to marginal competitor sales data, in the form of daily occupancy percentage, albeit aggregated across groups and lengths‐of‐stay. Despite its availability, this data is not widely incorporated into revenue management estimation, likely due to the lack of robust models and methodologies. In this paper, focusing mainly on the hotel industry, we develop a constrained maximum likelihood method (constrained by moment conditions) to overcome the following significant challenges in estimation of a market share model with a competitor attractiveness factor: (i) competitor data is aggregated across multiple lengths‐of‐stay with varying demand characteristics; (ii) no‐purchase data is unobservable, preventing tracking of customers who choose neither the focal firm's (we refer to as our) product nor the competitor's product; (iii) private (unobserved) group sales of competitors prior to retail sales reduce competitor capacity and influence their subsequent prices; and finally, (iv) maximizing the partial‐information likelihood function is intractable. We first evaluate our method through Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic data generated under a generalized Nash competition model. In these simulations, our method accurately recovers the true parameters to a close degree in almost all cases, exploiting the marginal competitor data. Next, we apply the method to real‐world hotel booking data and benchmark its performance against alternative approaches from the network tomography and revenue management literature.</content>

    <title>How Group Consumption Affects Coupon Acquisition and Redemption: The Moderating Role of Offline Agglomeration in Online Group Buying</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Local merchants have implemented coupon promotions to attract consumer traffic and improve product sales. Drawing upon signaling theory, this paper examines how a social characteristic of a coupon (i.e., group consumption) influences coupon acquisition and subsequent coupon redemption, along with how such relationships are further influenced by offline agglomeration (i.e., density and product agglomeration). Specifically, we argue that group consumption increases coupon acquisition, which in turn increases coupon redemption, with coupon acquisition serving as a mediator in the relationship. These relationships, however, are contingent upon offline agglomeration signals. Using a large panel data set from a prominent group buying platform, we collect 121,909 observations to test our theoretical model. The findings reveal a positive relationship between group consumption and coupon acquisition and a positive relationship between coupon acquisition and redemption, while the relationship between group consumption and coupon redemption is fully mediated by coupon acquisition. Furthermore, we find that the effect of group consumption on coupon acquisition is strengthened by density agglomeration but attenuated by product agglomeration. The effect of coupon acquisition on redemption is reinforced by density agglomeration. These findings offer valuable implications for local merchants who are seeking to optimize their coupon promotions.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Side‐Hustle Thriving on Full‐Time Work Performance: A Conservation of Resources Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise of digital labour platforms has made side‐hustles a defining feature of modern work. The debate over whether side‐hustles benefit or burden full‐time work remains unresolved. We propose side‐hustle thriving as a key factor. Drawing on the conservation of resources theory, we theorize dual pathways: Side‐hustle thriving enhances full‐time work performance through psychological detachment from and affective well‐being within employees' full‐time roles (resource gain), yet simultaneously impairs it via side‐hustle attention residue and full‐time work resource depletion (resource depletion). Two studies, one with 10‐day experience sampling (N = 97, 644 observations) and another with a multisource, multiwave design (N = 247), support this framework. Crucially, we identify boundary segmentation preference between side‐hustles and full‐time work as a key moderator: Employees who strongly separate work domains amplify the resource gain pathway while mitigating resource depletion. This research offers a nuanced framework for managing multiple jobholding in the gig economy era.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a unique data set of firms listed on China’s Shenzhen Stock Exchange, we show that investors’ corporate site visits convey information about future stock returns. Firms with abnormally frequent investor visits predictably outperform firms with abnormally infrequent investor visits by approximately 70-to-100 basis points per month. This return predictability concentrates on neglected firms with low trading volumes and when investors incur higher travel costs. Abnormally frequent investor visits accompany increased holdings among visiting institutions and predict improvements in firms’ fundamental performance, consistent with institutions using visits to gain an information advantage regarding underpriced firms.The significance of conducting site visits and in-depth research by fund companies is to consistently deliver stable and substantial returns to clients through professional expertise.

    <title>Limits to Political Capture: Evidence from Patent Grants, Disclosures, and Litigation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Substantial evidence suggests that regulatory agencies in the United States can be captured by the politicians who oversee them. We provide novel evidence of a federal agency in which capture is limited: the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Although patent applications from politically connected applicants are slightly more likely to be approved despite being of lower ex post quality, additional analyses suggest these outcomes are not indicative of capture. In particular, the disclosure quality of connected patents' legal claims increases more than unconnected patents during the review process, narrowing the scope of the patents and constraining the intellectual property rights. Furthermore, connected patents are no more likely than others to be litigated ex post, suggesting these patent grants are not spurious. Our findings provide insights into how the design of a regulator can limit the benefits that accrue to politically connected firms.</content>

    <title>The Death of a Technical Skill</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For managers, we show that opportunities for skill development strongly influence matching in online information technology (IT) markets. Employers cannot easily circumvent labor scarcity by adopting older technologies, as workers avoid projects with declining future skill value absent substantial wage premiums. However, older workers, having shorter career horizons, are less sensitive to declining skill value, suggesting potential benefits in matching them with legacy technologies. For policy makers, our research demonstrates that labor market tightness persists across both new and old technologies in online IT markets. This challenges the notion that employers can engage in labor arbitrage by avoiding cutting-edge technologies. Policy frameworks therefore need flexibility to address skill shortages wherever they emerge. Additionally, our findings highlight the need for more granular data collection on technical skill evolution beyond broad occupational categories. Our online context provides unique insights into how corporate decisions about technology standards cascade into labor markets. The findings underscore the importance of policies promoting continuous learning and adaptability, while suggesting that age-diverse hiring practices could help address both skill shortages and age discrimination concerns in technical fields.</content>

    <title>Organizational Burden or Catalyst for Ideas? Disability as a Driver of Cognitive Flexibility and Creativity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Disability is typically perceived negatively, and employees with a disability are viewed as a burden that requires accommodation. We draw from creativity theory to challenge this view and propose that disability can make workplace imperfections salient, can function as a situational cue that increases coworkers’ cognitive flexibility, and thus can be a catalyst for creativity. We apply a multi-study, multi-method approach to test these predictions. First, results from time-lagged and objective data in a sample of 7,037 employees from 425 units of a large German car manufacturer show that units with people with disabilities generate more ideas, particularly when employees engage in perspective taking. Second, an experiment with 954 employees shows that having a colleague with a disability has a positive individual-level effect on idea generation. Third, we extend these findings with a full model test in a second experiment of 1,314 employees, which shows that having a colleague with a disability (compared to not having a colleague with a disability) leads to more idea generation and higher idea novelty. Increased cognitive flexibility mediates these effects. Together, our findings contribute to the disability, diversity, and creativity literatures by integrating disability and creativity theory and showing that disability has the potential to serve as a catalyst for creativity and, ultimately, innovation.</content>

    <title>Future Making: Towards a Practice Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Management scholars are increasingly interested in ‘future making’, observing and theorizing how organizational actors produce and enact the yet‐to‐come. However, the rapid growth of the conversation runs the risk of emptying the notion of future making, calling into question its meaning and relevance. In response to these concerns, ourPointis that there is value in understanding future making from a practice perspective. A practice perspective, we argue, is empirically sufficiently open to account for the plurality and open‐endedness of futures and future making amidst the continual emergence of interrelated crises, large‐scale challenges, and intractable technologies. Thus, it reinforces the relevance of research on future making as a central part of contemporary organizational life. At the same time, the four practice‐based dimensions elaborated in thisPointprovide sufficient conceptual specificity to discern what counts as future making and what does not, thereby providing solid ground for cumulative theory‐building and research in this area. OurPointextends research on future making in management studies by substantiating the relevance of examining and theorizing future making, and by articulating and clarifying a practice perspective on future making that directs scholarly attention to important areas for future research.</content>

    <title>The Mixed Gamble of Competitive Dynamics in Family‐Controlled Firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We extend the mixed gamble perspective to explain how family‐controlled firms frame and evaluate the difficult trade‐off between potential gains and losses in financial wealth (FW) and socioemotional wealth (SEW) when pursuing portfolio‐level strategic initiatives, as captured by competitive aggressiveness and complexity. Analyzing 570 public‐listed Korean firms from 1998 to 2017, we find that family‐controlled firms tend to avoid competitive aggressiveness and complexity in their strategic action portfolios. However, our broader perspective leads us to identify critical boundary conditions: this reluctance weakens when firms fall below historical and social performance aspiration levels, as the risks to FW and SEW become more apparent. Conversely, their reluctance strengthens when they retain many family business group affiliations that provide safeguards for FW and SEW.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Variance decomposition approaches are often used to identify key sources of heterogeneity in firm performance. While previous variance decomposition studies have decomposed the drivers of firm performance in product markets (financial performance), we focus on differences in firms' abilities to create the resources that underlie such product market successes. Specifically, we focus on innovation performance. We identify the relative importance of technology area, corporation, business unit, and star inventor effects in determining firms' (1) innovation output, (2) innovation social value, (3) innovation value appropriation, and (4) innovation financial value. We find, across our four measures of innovation performance, the business unit effect is by far the largest (32.6 per cent), followed by the star inventor effect (11.5 per cent), the corporate effect (5.5 per cent), and the technology area effect (1.9 per cent). We discuss the implications of these findings for future innovation studies.</content>

    <title>Artificial states, ethnicity, and the survival of private participation infrastructure projects in Africa</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite increasing interest, research within the context of Africa, particularly in relation to its unique historical dynamics, remains relatively underexplored in international business (IB). ​Our paper explores how colonial-era historical legacies continue to shape the outcomes of present-day private participation infrastructure (PPI) projects in Africa. By analyzing 301 PPI projects across 102 ethnic groups in 32 African countries, we offer insights into how borders misaligned with pre-colonial ethnic boundaries contribute to conflicts that undermine project viability. The findings reveal that ethnic partitioning, defined as the division of ethnic groups across artificial national borders, negatively impacts PPI project survival, with conflict mediating this relationship. While higher institutional quality mitigates these adverse effects, its impact remains marginal. We incorporate historical perspectives and highlight the importance of considering the path dependence of contemporary institutional environments. It also addresses the growing demand for Africa-focused IB research. By incorporating ethnicity into institutional analyses, our study also challenges the traditional IB assumption regarding the primacy of national borders in business activities. Our study points to the importance of understanding historical backgrounds when doing business in Africa.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Effective communication relies on consumers remembering, sharing, and applying relevant information. Source memory, the ability to link a claim to its original source, is an essential aspect of accurate recall, attitude formation, and decision making. We propose that claim objectivity, whether a claim is a fact or an opinion, affects memory for the claim’s source. This proposal follows a two-step process: (i) opinions provide more information about sources than facts do; (ii) claims that provide more information about sources during information encoding are more likely to be accurately attributed to original sources during recall. Across thirteen pre-registered experiments (N = 7,510) and a variety of consumer domains, we investigate the effect of claim objectivity on source memory. We find that source memory is more accurate for opinions than for facts, with no consistent effect on claim recognition memory. We find support for the proposed process by manipulating facts to be more informative about sources and opinions to be less informative about sources. When forming inferences and seeking advice from sources, participants rely more on previously-shared opinions than on previously-shared facts. Our results indicate that opinions are more likely to be accurately attributed to original sources than are facts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores a new channel through which exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can affect underlying asset prices. In over-the-counter markets, daily disclosure of ETF portfolio holdings increases price transparency and thereby retail investors’ bargaining power. I show that ETF-held municipal bonds have significantly lower dealer markups than observationally similar non-ETF-held bonds. This effect cannot be explained by bond selection or ETFs’ own trading activity. Rather, ETFs’ disclosure of end-of-day bond pricing is associated with lower retail markups by 5–9 basis points.</content>

    <title>Identification and Inference in First-Price Auctions with Risk-Averse Bidders and Selective Entry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study identification and inference in first-price auctions with risk-averse bidders and selective entry, building on a flexible framework we call the Affiliated Signal with Risk Aversion (AS-RA) model. Assuming exogenous variation in either the number of potential bidders (N) or a continuous instrument (z) shifting opportunity costs of entry, we provide a sharp characterization of the nonparametric restrictions implied by equilibrium bidding. This characterization implies that risk neutrality is nonparametrically testable. In addition, with sufficient variation in both N and z, the AS-RA model primitives are nonparametrically identified (up to a bounded constant) on their equilibrium domains. Finally, we explore new methods for inference in set-identified auction models based on Chen et al. (2018, Econometrica, vol. 86, 1965–2018), as well as novel and fast computational strategies using Mathematical Programming with Equilibrium Constraints. Simulation studies reveal the good finite-sample performance of our inference methods, which can readily be adapted to other set-identified flexible equilibrium models with parameter-dependent support.</content>

    <title>Structural Estimation Under Misspecification: Theory and Implications for Practice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A researcher can use a tightly parameterized structural model to obtain internally consistent estimates of a wide range of economically interesting targets. We ask how reliable these estimates are when the researcher’s model may be misspecified. We focus on the case of multivariate, potentially nonlinear models where the causal variable of interest is endogenous. Reliable estimates require that the researcher’s model is flexible enough to describe the effects of the endogenous variable approximately correctly. Reliable estimates do not require that the researcher has correctly specified the role of the exogenous controls in the model. However, if the role of the controls is misspecified, reliable estimates require a property we call strong exclusion. Strong exclusion depends on having sufficiently many instruments that are unrelated to the controls. We discuss how practitioners can achieve strong exclusion, and illustrate our findings with an application to a differentiated goods model of demand for beer.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Workplace relationships are a necessary and critical component of being able to perform one’s job and advance in one’s career. The personal and professional resources required for navigating relationships with dissimilar work colleagues can be particularly costly for those in minority groups who are most often different from their relational partners. Drawing from interviews conducted with Black women executives, we examined how these women experience relational triggers that emphasize their differences from others because of their limited numbers at their level. Our findings indicate that Black women executives respond to these relational triggers by engaging in perspective-taking and status reflexivity to understand others’, and their own, perspectives on the identity and status differentials present in the interaction. Through an introspective process, these women assess and address gaps in how they believe their partners see them and how they see themselves, which prompts them to either reduce or maintain perceived gaps depending on the importance of the interaction partner. We also explore how reducing or maintaining the perceived gap ultimately influences how Black women think, feel, or behave toward their relational partner (i.e., relational valence) in ways that may shape how they interpret future interactions. This study advances workplace relationships research by integrating intersectionality literature and by considering how minority perspective-taking and status reflexivity can be useful in navigating relationships across difference.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Statistical Arbitrage with Price ImpactA key challenge to turn price forecasts into profitable trading strategies is to mitigate the adverse impact of large trades. This paper shows that such statistical arbitrage problems can be solved in closed form for general nonparametric price forecasts and for price impact models that account for the nonlinearity in order sizes and gradual decay of impact observed empirically. The implications of these results are illustrated by an empirical case study, in which the price impact models are calibrated to proprietary metaorder data.</content>

    <title>The Joint Determination of Haircuts and Interest Rates for Collateralized Loans in Shadow Banking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the joint determination of haircuts and interest rates for collateralized loans in shadow banking within a general equilibrium model. Three results emerge. First, higher downside quality (the distribution of future collateral payoffs below the debt face value) reduces haircuts only under certain conditions, whereas higher upside quality (the distribution of future collateral payoffs above the debt face value) always increases them. Second, the relative insensitivity of interest rates to shocks, compared with haircuts, occurs when shocks affect only the upside collateral quality and can also arise endogenously, with changes in haircuts amplified and changes in interest rates dampened. Third, when depositors’ saving needs increase, interest rates unexpectedly rise while haircut requirements are relaxed. The same effects occur when banks’ collateral supply shrinks.This paper was accepted by Bruno Biais, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00541 .</content>

    <title>Evolutions of Omni‐Channel Fulfillment Performance: An In‐Depth Case Study in Grocery Retailing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rapid adoption of omni‐channel strategies has prompted grocery retailers to reconfigure their back‐end fulfillment operations to efficiently and effectively meet the demands of online and offline retail channels. Viewing back‐end fulfillment operations in omni‐channel grocery retail as a complex adaptive system, we present an eight‐year multi‐method case study of the UK operations of a leading global grocery retailer. Over this period the share of online sales significantly grew as proportion of overall sales. We observe four evolutions in the back‐end fulfillment complex adaptive system to respond to the operational demands associated with increasing online sales. Complex adaptive systems theory suggests that such evolutions should eventually lead to a state of equilibrium, where the system is reconfigured to effectively and efficiently respond to the market. However, we observe that this equilibrium was never achieved and propose this results from two opposing and irreconcilable environmental energies preventing optimal adaptation. Drawing on both in‐depth interviews and a proprietary fulfillment dataset from the organization, we expose the implications of conflicting energies being imported from the environment, and propose three strategies, drawn from paradox theory, for reconciling these energies within a complex adaptive system.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: How Firms Can Steer Social Media Conversations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many firms struggle with how to craft their messages in conversations with customers on social media. The problem is compounded by the fact that these conversations take place in different, simultaneous threads, each of which potentially requires a different approach depending on the conversation. This paper studies how firms can adapt their responses in individual social media conversations such that the sentiment in different conversations becomes more favorable. We examine a comprehensive set of firm-generated content elements inspired by theory of dialogic listening that emphasizes that a conversation partner should offer 1) empathetic understanding, 2) unconditional positive regard, 3) a spirit of mutual understanding, 4) presentness, and 5) genuineness. We augment this set by also considering taking conversations to a one-on-one channel and whether agents sign with their own name, indicating a personal connection. We furthermore test whether the FGC elements’ effectiveness depends on preceding user sentiment. Based on an analysis of nearly a million tweets capturing over 206k threads involving four major US banks across 10 years, we provide concrete managerial guidance on responding effectively on social media to maximize the positive impact on the sentiment of subsequent user-generated content, and how this guidance depends on preceding user sentiment.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Putting Words in Their Mouths: Firm-Generated User Content and Consumer Sharing Behavior</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;User-generated content, such as word of mouth, traditionally has been immune to firm influences. However, companies have recently started developing content and encouraging consumers to post it rather than relying solely on organic consumer-generated content. Such firm-generated user content (FGUC), which consumers can share easily, potentially alters their sharing behavior by providing specific language to be included in users’ posts. In investigating the effectiveness of FGUC, the current research addresses if and when consumers share this content and whether they alter it. It also identifies which mechanisms drive sharing decisions and the moderating effects of satisfaction. With a series of lab and field studies, the authors demonstrate that providing FGUC increases the likelihood that consumers share a post about their brand experience, by making the sharing process easier. It also tempers the extent to which dissatisfied consumers share posts, by creating incongruence with their experience. This initial, extensive assessment of the emerging FGUC phenomenon offers relevant guidance for marketers regarding when and how to use this novel tool and the potential implications for consumer welfare.</content>

    <title>Rethinking international business scholarship as cross-language knowledge production: a dialogical approach to qualitative research</title>
    <updated>2025-03-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As a disciplinary field, international business (IB) is characterized by language diversity. Too often, however, international business (IB) research regards language diversity as a challenge to be overcome rather than an opportunity to generate new scientific knowledge. Consequently, previous research has primarily focused on the pragmatic, logistical, and methodological hurdles of translating multilingual datasets. In contrast, this conceptual paper takes language diversity as an opportunity to produce new knowledge and proposes a dialogical approach to qualitative cross-language research. The dialogical approach has the potential to enrich IB research with novel perspectives from under-represented voices, improve the understanding of IB phenomena and nurture tolerance for diversity and inclusion through cross-language interaction. It is worth noting that the dialogical approach does not promote shared understanding but mutual understanding that is achieved through collaboration. In doing so, it builds on two types of dialogue: (self-)reflexive dialogue, and dialogue between the researcher and others (interviewees, supervisors, and collaborators participating in the research process). The outcome is knowledge that is pluralistic and multivocal, including the voices that belong to non-English-speaking participants and scholars. We argue that the dialogical approach contributes to the future vision of responsible and linguistically inclusive IB scholarship.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate whether managers’ intrinsic incentives affect firms’ environmental policies. Exploiting within-facility variation in facility-to-CEO-birthplace distances, we find that facilities located near CEOs’ birthplaces experience toxic emission reductions relative to those farther away. This is achieved by reducing waste generation at source rather than by downsizing operations or substituting pollution across locations. The effect is strongest for hometown facilities in high-polluting areas, and in firms with higher cash holdings and with CEOs with weaker pay incentives. Our results suggest that local representation in management could be a powerful means of encouraging corporate pollution abatement.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Open strategy (OS) requires contributors with a variety of functional backgrounds to episodically perform a strategy role in addition to their functional responsibilities. These actors engage in micro‐role transitions as they temporarily shift from one role to another. In this study, we identify the discursive tactics through which such micro‐role transitions are enacted by drawing on data from an online OS community. We show that in OS, micro‐role transitions occur in an ambiguous role environment where actors actively construct role entry using downplaying tactics and justifying tactics, and imbue ill‐defined strategy roles with meaning by applying idealizing tactics. These moralized discourses enable actors to distance themselves not only from their functional roles but also from the role of professional strategists. We show that the interplay of role distance and responses of different relevant actors shapes actors' strategy role formation in OS. We synthesize these arguments into a conceptual model and provide new insights into the role dynamics involved in OS and beyond, as well as the role‐level factors underpinning the efficacy of OS.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the relationship between major customer concentration and supplier firms’ adoption of blockchain. Using a sample of 9,745 Chinese firm-year observations spanning 2018–2021, we find that the likelihood of suppliers’ blockchain technology adoption in supply chain management is negatively associated with major customer concentration. The negative relation is reduced when supplier firms possess greater bargaining power and demonstrate governance mechanisms against information leakage, and when major customers have less incentive to engage in opportunistic behaviors, and have fewer concerns regarding information leakage by suppliers. Our findings suggest that major customers tend to discourage supplier firms from adopting blockchain due to the concerns regarding competitive advantages and information leakage risk.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze howNfirms producing a commodity good with a polluting by-product respond to environmental taxes. These firms vary in operational and environmental efficiency. Under Cournot competition, we examine two demand functions: iso-elastic and linear. We establish the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium and how it changes with tax levels and environmental efficiency. Our findings suggest that taxes may not always benefit firms with green, low-cost technologies, as they erode the advantages of operational efficiency. Additionally, total and per-unit emissions may increase with higher taxes or improved environmental efficiency. Finally, the observed effects can qualitatively differ based on the form of market demand.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate an ambulatory care scheduling problem derived from a real case in Ontario, Canada that offers multi-appointment, multi-class, multi-priority treatments in geographically distributed campuses with multiple resources. We consider a dynamic setting with uncertain patient arrival and use of the emergency department. This problem is formulated as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process model. Since we cannot solve large-sized instances via conventional approaches, we hybridize this model with a neural network to simplify feasibility constraints while respecting all assumptions. Given the curse of dimensionality, we use an affine approximation architecture to estimate the value function. An equivalent linear programming model is solved through column generation in order to compute approximate optimal policies and derive two easy-to-implement scheduling policies. Simulation results demonstrate that the approximate optimal policy and heuristics outperform alternative scheduling policies. Finally, we demonstrate that the application of our methodology can enhance performance metrics in a large ambulatory care center in Canada. We show that a template-based scheduling rule can result in high resource utilization but poor scheduling decisions. However, an efficient scheduling policy equips a booking clerk with intelligent scheduling rules that are difficult for her to predict in real-time and work well in comparison to scheduling templates.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Mitigating Churn after Online Financial Fraud: the Value of Blame Attribution</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The financial industry is plagued with account-based fraudulent transactions in which perpetrators surreptitiously siphon away money from customer accounts. To address this recurrent problem, service operations teams at financial institutions (e.g., the fraud detection and mitigation teams) spend millions yearly identifying perpetrators, attributing blame, and averting customer churn. However, in the vast majority of cases, the service operations teams cannot trace fraudulent transactions back to the perpetrators, and hence it remains unclear whether they should continue to expend significant resources into investigating account-based fraud and attributing blame. Employing a wide range of econometric and machine learning techniques on a rich dataset from a U.S. bank, and an experiment, we attempt to offer the first empirical assessment of the association between blame attribution, or lack of it, in response to customer-identified account-based fraud and customer churn. The results indicate that relative to the customers that did not experience fraud, those that did and received a resolutionlackingblame attribution have 40.69%Lift(95% CI = [24.41%Lift, 56.97%Lift]) in churn rate. However, customers that experienced fraud and received a resolution involving blame attribution have -62.45%Lift(95% CI = [-31.22%Lift, -93.68%Lift]) in churn rate, making them less likely to churn than those that did not experience fraud. The latter result offers one of the first field evidence of the well-known service recovery paradox. Additionally, we observe significant heterogeneity in the findings based on customer tenure and the number of customer-firm interactions and document the long-term effects of attributing and not attributing blame. These insights can assist service operations teams in their post-service failure efforts to mend customer-firm relationships. Overall, the results underscore the importance of blame attribution during service recovery for service operations teams and inform a topical debate on a banking reform proposed by the U.S. Department of Treasury.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Pricing in the Presence of Strategic Consumers and Social Learning under Contingent Pricing and Price Guarantee</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Purchasing new experience products or services often involves significant quality uncertainty for both consumers and firms. Social learning through online reviews helps reduce this uncertainty but exacerbates strategic waiting, as consumers delay purchases to gain more information. This paper examines the impact of social learning on firms’ pricing policies in the presence of strategic consumers under two widely adopted schemes: contingent pricing and price guarantee. We find that while social learning always benefits the firm, it enables the price guarantee scheme to outperform contingent pricing in terms of profitability for highly patient consumers, which would not be possible without social learning. Notably, social learning drives a range of pricing patterns, even making price skimming optimal under price guarantee for highly patient consumers, as high initial prices combined with markdowns effectively alleviate strategic waiting, enhancing review outcomes and the firm’s profitability. Additionally, social learning always enables the firm to extract greater consumer surplus for impatient consumers under price guarantee. In contrast, social learning under contingent pricing consistently benefits consumers and can achieve win-win outcomes when consumers are moderately patient. Our extensions validate the robustness of these findings under different assumptions, including fully rational consumers and partially forward-looking firms. In particular, a partially forward-looking firm can achieve win-win outcomes with social learning under price guarantee, expanding its practical applicability. This study provides novel insights into the role of social learning in shaping pricing strategies, highlighting its implications for firm profitability and consumer welfare in markets influenced by review dynamics and strategic consumers.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we explore the impact of implementing an algorithmic supervisor, a data analytics tool that offers real-time feedback to employees, on their overall performance. We collaborate with a leading service company that initiated the transition from human supervisors to an algorithmic supervisor for managing call agents in their outbound call center on September 18, 2019. We collect data for 220,085 calls over a span of 6 months—that is, 3 months before and 3 months after the introduction of the algorithmic supervisor. We find that the introduction of the algorithmic supervisor improved the agents’ service quality in terms of customer satisfaction; however, this came at the expense of quantity as fewer customers were served. In particular, the adoption of the algorithmic supervisor resulted in a 15.80% reduction in the number of served customers, accompanied by a 14.91% increase in the number of satisfied customers. Moreover, our study uncovers a gender-related dimension to the impact of the algorithmic supervisor. Before its adoption, male agents outperformed their female counterparts. However, after its adoption, female agents exhibited an 11.52% increase in the number of served customers, and a remarkable 14.00% increase in the number of satisfied customers as compared to their male counterparts. Our results suggest that the adoption of the algorithmic supervisor strikes a new economic balance between service quality and service quantity and generates a social impact in differently affecting service performance of female and male employees.</content>

These scores typically consider a number of factors including ad relevance, clickthrough rate, and landing page quality. While quality scores are often justified as a mechanism to enhance ad rank and reduce cost per click for high-quality ads, this study examines their broader role in incentivizing advertisers with varying investment costs to improve landing page quality and explores the implications for advertisers’ profits and the platform’s revenue in a setting where landing page quality is an endogenous decision made by advertisers.The results suggest that a quality score function rewarding landing page quality in excess of the clickthrough rate incentivizes advertisers to invest in page quality in a non-monotonic way. These incentives have dual effects on auction dynamics: while advertisers can lower their cost per click by improving quality, such incentives also increase advertisers’ competitive pressure to maintain their quality advantage and secure the discount per click, particularly for those in higher positions. Our findings reveal that the former effect dominates, leading to increased advertiser profits with higher rewards. However, the intensified competition slows the profit growth for the top-position advertiser when the bottom-position advertiser invests. For platform revenue, which comprises both auction revenue and benefits derived from user experience, a quality score in excess of CTR is recommended when the user experience benefits are substantial enough to compensate for auction revenue losses. In a scenario where page quality is capped, our results show that a quality score in excess of CTR can generate higher platform revenue, even in the absence of user experience benefits. Several managerial implications for both advertisers and the platform are discussed.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Axiomatic Insights into Ambiguity Aversion: Binary Diversification and Exact CapacitiesIn decision sciences, ambiguity refers to uncertainty about event probabilities, and aversion to it is a well-studied phenomenon. In “Binary Diversification Characterizes Exact Capacities,” Hartmann and Kauffeldt consider the Choquet expected utility model, a framework for modeling ambiguity. They provide the first axiomatic characterization of exact capacities, solving an old problem. Their characterizing axiom, binary diversification, captures a specific level of ambiguity aversion—a preference for diversifications that lead to (at most) binary outcomes. They also propose an intuitive hierarchy of ambiguity aversion and illustrate that this hierarchy reflects increasingly strong levels of ambiguity aversion within the more general invariant biseparable model, whereas the hierarchy has limited bite in the Choquet model. They conclude by illustrating the implications for multiobjective shortest-path problems, demonstrating how the results can be applied.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose an approach for determining the sample size required when using an experiment to train and certify a targeting policy. Calculating the rate at which the performance of a targeting model improves with additional training data is a complex problem. We address this challenge by assuming that customers are grouped into segments that capture relevant information about their responsiveness to the firm’s marketing actions. We consider two problem formulations. The first formulation identifies the sample size required to train a targeting policy and certify that its expected performance exceeds a predefined threshold. The second formulation identifies the sample size required to train a targeting policy and certify that it outperforms a baseline in an out-of-sample statistical test. We establish theoretical properties of these problems, based on which we propose computationally efficient algorithms for optimal sample size calculations. We illustrate our algorithms and analysis using data from a luxury fashion retailer.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02947 .</content>

    <title>The Informativeness of Balance Sheet Disaggregations: Evidence from Forecasting Operating Assets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the usefulness of balance sheet disaggregations in the context of forecasting operating asset growth and its implications for revenue growth. We show that models using disaggregated balance sheet information have greater accuracy than models that use only aggregate information, with the most accurate disaggregation scheme separately considering property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, other noncurrent operating assets, and current operating assets. When investigating market participants’ use of disaggregated balance sheet information, we find that differences in growth predictions from a disaggregated model and an aggregate model are associated with year-ahead abnormal returns, suggesting that investors do not fully utilize disaggregated balance sheet information. We corroborate this result by showing that returns are concentrated around the earnings announcement, are more pronounced for stocks with low transient institutional ownership, and are consistent with subsequent improvements in actual financial performance. Finally, we find that these returns are driven by both the asset growth predictions of a disaggregated model and the ability of such a model to incorporate the unique revenue-generating ability of individual asset components. Importantly, we find that our results are incremental to the information embedded in income statement disaggregations, even when forecasting income statement items such as profitability. Overall, our study provides evidence on the informativeness of balance sheet disaggregations and proposes the use of disaggregated models when forecasting growth in operating assets and its implications for future revenues.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org10.1287/mnsc.2023.01413 .</content>

    <title>Human-Algorithm Collaboration with Private Information: Naïve Advice-Weighting Behavior and Mitigation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Even if algorithms make better predictions than humans on average, humans may sometimes have private information that an algorithm does not have access to that can improve performance. How can we help humans effectively use and adjust recommendations made by algorithms in such situations? When deciding whether and how to override an algorithm’s recommendations, we hypothesize that people are biased toward following naïve advice-weighting (NAW) behavior; they take a weighted average between their own prediction and the algorithm’s prediction, with a constant weight across prediction instances regardless of whether they have valuable private information. This leads to humans overadhering to the algorithm’s predictions when their private information is valuable and underadhering when it is not. In an online experiment where participants were tasked with making demand predictions for 20 products while having access to an algorithm’s predictions, we confirm this bias toward NAW and find that it leads to a 20%–61% increase in prediction error. In a second experiment, we find that feature transparency—even when the underlying algorithm is a black box—helps users more effectively discriminate how to deviate from algorithms, resulting in a 25% reduction in prediction error. We make further improvements in a third experiment via an intervention designed to move users away from advice weighting and instead, use only their private information to inform deviations, leading to a 34% reduction in prediction error.This paper has been This paper was accepted by Elena Katok for the Special Issue on the Human-Algorithm Connection.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03850 .</content>

    <title>Pay transparency and productivity</title>
    <updated>2025-03-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article investigates the productivity consequences of pay transparency. Tracking the research output of 20,000 US academics and leveraging staggered shocks to transparency, we show that productivity responses vary predictably based on what pay transparency reveals. We reject a hypothesis that pay transparency leads to a decline in productivity. Rather, we find that those who transparency reveals to be inequitably overcompensated subsequently increase their effort, while those inequitably undercompensated subsequently weakly decrease their effort. Controlling for such pay inequity, the simple level of pay has little effect on productivity. Our study provides one of the first field‐based empirical investigations of the productivity consequences of wage transparency and points to the importance of clearly delineating the effects driven by equity as opposed to equality of rewards allocations.Managerial SummaryWhile evidence suggests that pay transparency consistently reduces discrimination, many organizations have resisted implementation over concerns about its impact on productivity. To date, there has been very little evidence to either confirm or reject this concern. This study of 20,000 US academics directly addresses the effect of pay transparency on productivity. We find that when salaries become public, average productivity does not decline. However, there is a varied individual productivity response that depends on what transparency reveals to individual employees about their pay and its fairness relative to peers. Employees who found they were paid more than their performance warranted increased their productivity, likely to justify their elevated compensation. Conversely, unfairly underpaid individuals decreased their productivity, particularly when they had job security. Notably, individuals seem to care more about pay fairness than pay equality. Our results also highlight another benefit of pay transparency: employees who became aware of the potential for substantial salary raises through promotion enhanced their productivity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A key question in labor market research is how the unemployment insurance system affects unemployment rates and labor market dynamics. We provide new answers to this old question by studying one of the largest unemployment insurance reforms in recent decades, the German Hartz reforms. On average, lower separation rates into unemployment account for 76% of declining unemployment after the reform, a fact unexplained by existing research focusing on job-finding rates. Exploiting institutional changes by age, employment duration, and wages, we establish a causal link between the reform and changes in labor market dynamics. Relying on labor market theory, we generalize our empirical findings beyond the German case and establish separation rate changes as an important macroeconomic adjustment channel after UI reforms. We derive analytically that the change of separation rates increases in proportion to average unemployment duration suggesting an equally important role for most other European labor markets.</content>

    <title>Long Jump Learning: Absorbing Distant Knowledge via Familiar Components</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do firms overcome the challenge of absorbing distant knowledge? Scholars argue that organizations need knowledge that is distant from their existing knowledge base to create novel innovative output, whereas others argue, in contrast, that organizations need knowledge to be similar to the firm’s knowledge base in order to absorb it. We argue that organizations can improve their ability to identify and comprehend knowledge from a distant knowledge category through learning associations made by a category link—a familiar tangible component previously used by somebody else in the distant knowledge category. We test our arguments using a sample of patents in which the material graphene is used as a component across diverse patent classes (i.e., knowledge categories). We find that increasing experience with category-linking graphene enables an organization to patent in increasingly distant graphene-linked patent classes and also increases the number of patents in such classes. We also find that the extent to which category-linking graphene is prominent in a distant knowledge category enhances the effect of graphene experience on a firm’s ability to absorb knowledge from the distant knowledge category. We, thus, present a novel internal mechanism by which an organization can absorb distant knowledge.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers and other audiences often penalize products that combine unrelated elements. In this paper, we document the consequences of that penalty for the evaluation of the elements being combined. Building on the idea that audiences cannot fully disentangle the quality of “fit” between elements from the quality of the elements individually, we argue that audiences are likely to direct their dislike of a misfit product to the individual elements being combined. Using an archival study of the music industry and an online experiment with photographic galleries, we find that evaluations of individual elements (songs, photographs) are influenced by product-level fit (albums, galleries). Elements of misfit products are evaluated less favorably than they would have been otherwise. Moreover, this bias is exacerbated when the evaluation of the whole product is emphasized. We discuss the implications of this “misfit bias” for the innovation, entrepreneurship, and categories literatures.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17462 .</content>

    <title>The (Heterogeneous) Economic Effects of Private Equity Buyouts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The effects of private equity buyouts on employment, productivity, and job reallocation vary tremendously with macroeconomic and credit conditions, across private equity groups, and by type of buyout. We reach this conclusion by examining the most extensive database of U.S. buyouts ever compiled, encompassing thousands of buyout targets from 1980 to 2013 and millions of control firms. Employment shrinks 12% over two years after buyouts of publicly listed firms—on average, and relative to control firms—but expands 15% after buyouts of privately held firms. Postbuyout productivity gains at target firms are large on average and much larger yet for deals executed amid tight credit conditions. A postbuyout tightening of credit conditions or slowing of gross domestic product growth curtails employment growth and intrafirm job reallocation at target firms. We also show that buyout effects differ across the private equity groups that sponsor buyouts, and these differences persist over time at the group level. Rapid upscaling in deal flow at the group level brings lower employment growth at target firms. We relate these findings to theories of private equity that highlight agency problems at portfolio firms and within the private equity industry itself.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Harvard Business School’s Division of Research, the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, the Smith Richardson Foundation [Grant no. 2014-0136], and the Private Capital Research Institute.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03890 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use panel data on expected and realized changes in household finances to study the process of expectation formation. Households extrapolate from improvements in financial situation, but deteriorations are associated with an increased dispersion of forecasts, and higher probabilities of both negative and positive forecast errors. Individuals who expect earnings declines to revert too quickly save less and are more likely to be financially worse off again in the future. Learning from past errors reduces the likelihood that individuals are optimistic following a deterioration in their finances. The evidence shows how experiences, learning, and life events matter for expectation formation.This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03257 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Central bank liquidity backstops and bank leverage regulation interact across financial intermediaries and states of the world. A backstop is implemented only in some states to grease the wheels of bank dealers that absorb fire sales. It also incentivizes asset managers to take on excessive redemption risk. Regulation binds in other states, in which it hamstrings market making. Because this outcome increases asset managers’ fire sale costs, it reins in their risk-taking. Empirically, we confirm such a disciplining effect of regulation on U.S. money market funds. Theoretically, we derive that the two policy measures complement each other in raising social welfare because they address different sources of redemption-driven losses—fire sale costs for given risk-taking and excessive risk-taking, respectively.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.06997 .</content>

    <title>Success and Failure of Blockchain Technology Providers: Founders' Power, Beyond‐Blockchain Exploration and Centralized Decision‐Making</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite a growing focus on blockchain adoption within operations and supply chains, these initiatives exhibit an exceedingly high failure rate, with many failing to achieve sustainable success. Why are enterprise blockchain adoptions highly susceptible to failure? In our inductive case study of five technology providers offering blockchain services for operations and supply chains, we examine how founders' power (i.e., expert, prestige, and ownership) shapes management behaviors that build blockchain perceptions and influence stakeholders toward strategic adoption. Our findings reveal that high‐performing cases actively seek inspiration beyond the blockchain ecosystem for service designs and adopt a centralized decision‐making approach where key strategic decisions are made internally. In contrast, low‐performing cases struggle due to within‐blockchain exploration and decentralized decision‐making, leading to slower implementation and limited scalability. Furthermore, we find that founders' behaviors in blockchain adoption are embraced by firm members through performance evaluation and interactions, shaping organizational practices and culture, ultimately determining the success or failure of blockchain technology providers. This study extends previous research at the intersection of founders' power and blockchain literature by developing propositions about how different sources of founders' power lead to distinct management behaviors, influencing the success or failure of blockchain adoption outcomes.</content>

    <title>Beyond Rugged Individualism?: Exploring the Resilience of Black Entrepreneurs to Chronic Racism</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how the resilience process unfolds for Black entrepreneurs in the context of chronic racism, employing a novel qualitative approach that combines Group Model Building (GMB) and semi‐structured interviews with 49 Black entrepreneurs. Drawing on the socio‐ecological theory of resilience and leveraging Critical Race Theory (CRT), the research finds that resilience, shaped by the persistent nature of racism, requires ongoing adaptation rather than a return to a pre‐adversity state. This continuous adaptation can lead to the depletion of coping resources. The study also illustrates how internal and external coping mechanisms interact, showing that over‐reliance on internal coping mechanisms arises due to insufficient institutional and social support. Our research contributes to the literature on Black entrepreneurship, resilience, and race in entrepreneurship, while offering a comprehensive policy approach to both support and empower Black entrepreneurs. We advocate for decolonizing research practices that not only study but actively benefit the communities involved, fostering engaged and transformative scholarship.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractPeople frequently post their views on hot-button issues, such as immigration, on social media platforms on which the content is often publicly accessible to broad audiences. One of these audiences is hiring managers as more than 50% of organizations report viewing job applicants’ accounts as part of social media screening during the hiring process. Our research shows that applicants’ social media activity on hot-button issues can significantly impact their hireability. In a study of 377 professionals with hiring experience, we find that viewing applicants’ social media posts about immigration influenced judgments of similarity, likability, and two dimensions of hireability: expected task performance and expected organizational citizenship behaviors. Surprisingly, the hot-button posts outweighed job-relevant information regardless of where (Facebook or Twitter) the content was viewed; this indicates hiring managers generalized their impressions across social media platforms. A post hoc qualitative applicability check with 79 hiring managers confirmed these findings. Our study highlights the risks of using hedonic social media for screening job applicants, emphasizing the need for organizations to be mindful of how personal disclosures online can unintentionally influence hiring decisions.</content>

    <title>Algorithms to the Rescue: Market Mechanisms for Consensual Trading of Unbiased Individual Data</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper proposes a novel algorithmic market mechanism to address key challenges in individual data markets. Current data collection practices lack transparency and proper compensation, leading privacy-conscious users to opt out and creating biased data sets. Our proposed mechanism enables an intermediary platform to obtain unbiased samples of individual-level data while appropriately compensating users for privacy loss. Through theoretical analysis and simulations using both synthetic and real-world data sets, the authors demonstrate that their mechanism provides unbiased data samples at near-optimal cost compared with benchmark approaches. The mechanism outperforms both fixed-compensation methods and centralized-optimization approaches, even when platforms have partial information about user privacy preferences. Surprisingly, platforms achieve better outcomes by using this market mechanism rather than relying on estimated privacy preferences from user behavior. The approach is practical to implement, using straightforward sampling and conventional compensation mechanisms rather than complex techniques, like differential privacy. The mechanism enables creation of effective data markets that benefit both data subjects and buyers while ensuring compliance with regulations requiring transparency and consent. The findings are particularly relevant as new privacy regulations emerge globally and third-party tracking faces increased constraints, providing a viable solution for improving data quality and fairness in digital markets.</content>

    <title>Artificial Intelligence and Firm Resilience: Empirical Evidence from Natural Disaster Shocks</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly deployed in business operations over the past decade, whereas direct evidence of its effectiveness in uncertain contexts is limited. Our work examines the contribution of AI to corporate resilience under natural disaster shocks, particularly concentrating on AI-using and goods-producing firms. We measure firm AI investment by the cumulative AI-relevant skills extracted from a comprehensive job posting database and firm resilience by the changes in corporate valuation in response to operational shocks. Evidence suggests that AI generates resilience: An average firm that equips 2.4% of total jobs to be AI-related could approximately recover the full damage of disasters reflected in corporate valuation over a short event window. From the product function test, we find that resilience is attributable to the moderating effect of AI on the damaged input responsiveness under the volatile production environment. Our analyses further reveal a pressing phenomenon: Although underperforming firms could benefit more from an additional unit of AI investment, the realized productivity is notably restrained due to a lack of complementary organizational designs. Our findings provide managerial implications regarding the interplay between environmental conditions and firm investments in both AI technology and complementary infrastructures.</content>

    <title>Extrapolative Income Expectations and Retirement Savings</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how biased income expectations affect annual contributions to retirement accounts, highlighting variations across income levels. Empirical findings show that low-income workers are generally pessimistic about future earnings, whereas high-income workers tend to be overly optimistic. I develop a lifecycle model that merges these expectation biases with U.S. 401(k) plan features. The model reveals that biased expectations can account for observed delays in retirement contributions, which increase gradually with tenure. Contributions rise at different rates, with low-income workers starting later than high-income workers. Policy simulations indicate that automatic enrollment boosts initial contributions but results in a relative decline compared to active enrollment. Nonetheless, cumulative savings increase by 4.8 percent on average, with gains surpassing 10 percent for the lowest income quartile. These results highlight the significance of addressing income expectations in retirement policies and show that automatic enrollment can enhance welfare, particularly for lower-income individuals.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Injecting Little Variations to Create Large Gains: Rethinking Online Retail PricingIn today’s fast-changing markets, businesses rely on precise, timely causal insights to guide effective operational decisions. In a new study, “Instrumenting While Experimenting: An Empirical Method for Competitive Pricing at Scale,” the authors introduce an idea of “instrumenting while experimenting.” By introducing small, random variations into routine decision-making processes, they generate causal insights on the impact of business decisions across different competitive dynamics, enabling large-scale operational improvements without disrupting daily business operations.Partnering with a major U.S. e-commerce retailer, the researchers apply this approach to develop a competitive pricing method that enhances response accuracy to competitors’ price changes at scale. Implemented on over 10,000 products, the method delivers significant gains—boosting revenue by more than 15% and profit by over 10%. These gains stem from the successful implementation of the instrumenting while experimenting idea as well as the joint use of experimentation, causal inference, and optimization tools. Moreover, this framework and its implementation provide deeper substantive insights into competitive response strategies and offer a promising blueprint for businesses navigating dynamic online markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Tactics to Counter Missile and Drone ThreatsIn “Hard and Soft Defense Against a Sequence of Aerial Threats,” Atkinson and Kress develop an analytical model for missile defense in which a Blue defender counters sequential attacks by Red threats using both hard defense (HD) interceptors and soft measures (SM), such as jamming and decoys. Their model focuses on a shoot-look-shoot tactic by which Blue fires salvos of interceptors and then assesses the battle damage to decide on further engagement. Their objective is to minimize two performance metrics: the number of threats that manage to penetrate the defenses (leakers) and the number of costly interceptors expended. By establishing efficient frontiers in a two-dimensional performance space, they identify effective firing sequences for various scenarios. Their primary contribution is the development of a framework that integrates HD with SM, allowing for an examination of how SM affects interceptor allocation and missile defense tactics.</content>

First, future making scholarship overlooks existing academic research, in which similar concerns have been pursued, empirically and conceptually, for years. Second, utopian futures are considered achievable if only actors have a vision of what they wish to create. Finally, most future making statements around grand challenges rely on little more than hope, failing to account for the complex relationalities shaping them. I substantiate my argument by drawing on the scenario planning literature, Knightian uncertainty, and anthropology of future research. I also critique thePoint'scall for future making scholars to adopt practice‐based approaches (Wenzel et al., forthcoming) in their empirical inquiries, arguing that the ‘as Practice’ move in management studies is yet to achieve its aspirations. Additionally, I caution against the otherCounterpointin this debate that future making requires the realization of desired and emancipatory futures (Comi et al., forthcoming), as this view is too restrictive for broad and deep future making theorizing to emerge.</content>

    <title>Unveiling Propriety, Validity and Consensus: A Multi‐level Examination of Legitimacy Following the Global Financial Crisis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Previous work on legitimacy has conceptualized its multi‐level nature, encompassing individual‐level propriety and collective‐level validity. Recently, scholars have introduced the construct of consensus, the degree to which evaluators agree in terms of their propriety beliefs. While validity and consensus can overlap, they can also manifest distinctly, with validity masking underlying disagreement (i.e., low consensus). Furthermore, some work has begun to theorize the effects of this validity‐consensus incongruity from a multi‐level perspective, but it has yet to systematically integrate micro‐oriented theory to explain how evaluators assess legitimacy. We address this limitation by examining the individual‐level consequences of the validity‐consensus incongruity following a negative shock. Specifically, using a multi‐level regression discontinuity design and data from 6260 evaluators across 17 countries, we examine changes in evaluators' propriety beliefs about the legitimacy of free markets following the 2008 global financial crisis. In contrast to prior research, we theorize that high validity amplifies a shock's negative impact on evaluators' propriety beliefs. In addition, we establish how consensus explains variation in evaluators' responses to a shock, particularly in high‐validity, low‐consensus contexts. By bringing together two important strands of the legitimacy literature, we extend prior theory and pioneer an empirical test of the nuanced nature of legitimacy.</content>

    <title>Disentangling Knowledge Diversity: The Interactive Effect of Heterogeneity‐Based Knowledge Diversity and Inequality‐Based Knowledge Diversity on Team Innovation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Whereas knowledge heterogeneity has been extensively studied in relation to innovation, the inequality dimension of knowledge diversity has been largely unexplored. We propose that these two dimensions should be considered in conjunction, given thatheterogeneity‐based knowledge diversity– member differences in knowledge domain – can invite the elaboration of diverse information and perspectives that can foster team innovativeness, butinequality‐based knowledge diversity– member differences in recognized knowledge level – can disrupt the positive effect of heterogeneity‐based knowledge diversity by stifling the recognition and integration of these diverse perspectives. Our longitudinal analysis of drug patents supported our prediction that inequality‐based knowledge diversity weakened the positive effect of heterogeneity‐based knowledge diversity on knowledge team innovativeness. These findings suggest a fundamental reset in the study of team knowledge diversity: theory and research need to conceptualize team member knowledge differences as based on both heterogeneity and status inequality, and investigate their joint impact on team performance.</content>

    <title>Measuring Greenhouse Gas Emissions: What Are the Costs and Benefits?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We adopt a financial‐materiality approach in studying the costs and benefits of measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on social welfare. Production by firms internally generates direct GHG emissions (Scope 1 emissions) whereas outsourcing to suppliers generates indirect emissions (Scope 3 emissions). Our analysis incorporates two frictions: (1) long‐term negative environmental externalities caused by emissions and (2) fragmentation in regulating emissions disclosures across jurisdictions. We show firms' failure to internalize the environmental externalities provides a rationale for mandating Scopes 1 and 3 emissions disclosures. However, such disclosures induce emissions leakage. Disciplining emissions leakage calls for setting complementary—rather than independent—disclosure requirements for Scopes 1 and 3 emissions. Our analysis underscores the importance of improving the reliability of Scope 3 emissions measurements given that measurements of Scope 1 emissions are highly reliable for public firms in Europe and the United States. Regulators can further enhance the disciplinary effects of Scope 3 emission measurements by requiring the allocations of Scope 3 emissions in supply chains to individual firms, especially when allocating Scope 3 emissions is more reliable, and for firms/industries that are more prone to transition climate risk relative to physical climate risk.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Randomized Apportionment: A Fairer Distribution of SeatsThe question of how to apportion the seats of the U.S. House of Representatives to states has fueled century-long political debates and sparked mathematical theory. Traditional deterministic methods, such as the Hamilton method or the currently used Huntington–Hill method, may result in paradoxes or substantially deviate from proportionality. In their paper “In This Apportionment Lottery, the House Always Wins,” Gölz, Peters, and Procaccia propose a randomized approach that ensures each state receives its exact proportional share of seats in expectation and its proportional share, up to rounding, ex post. By incorporating randomization, the authors argue, the system can better adhere to the principle of proportional representation, minimizing the impact of small counting errors and ensuring fairness over time. In addition, their approach achieves house monotonicity, a property that prevents counterintuitive outcomes when the total number of seats changes. This is achieved through a novel cumulative rounding technique, a generalization of dependent rounding on bipartite graphs with potential applications beyond apportionment, including EU commission nominations and resource allocation.</content>

    <title>Price-Fixing Cartels and Firm Innovation</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the relationship between price-fixing cartels and firm innovation using a data set encompassing all 461 cartel cases and 1,818 firms identified in the United States in the years 1975–2016. A difference-in-differences estimation reveals a positive relationship between collusion and innovation. Colluding firms exhibited increases of 28% in patent filings, 20% in top-quality patents, and 16% in research and development investment. Innovation breadth also expanded by 16%, suggesting that firms explored new technological areas. Once cartels were dissolved, innovation activities reverted to precollusion levels. The effect varied across industries and was more pronounced in fast-growing and patent-intensive industries, underscoring the importance of technological opportunities. Further, the umbrella pricing effect that also benefits noncolluding competitors offers a unique opportunity to unpack mechanisms. Results reveal that the extra financial resources account for at least a quarter of the effect with stronger cartels exhibiting more pronounced effects. Specifically, firms that relied more on internal financing before collusion and that generated higher revenues during collusion showed a greater effect; no evidence was found of capital reallocation within firms. As much as the remaining three quarters of the effect can be attributed to managerial expectations of future profitability. These findings offer insights for managers and policymakers aiming to foster novel innovation although careful interpretation is required given the heterogeneous effects.This paper was accepted by Ashish Arora, entrepreneurship and innovation.Funding: This work was supported by the Institute of Management Research, Seoul National University; Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2020.01838 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cryptocurrencies have prompted a shift away from classic security attacks toward ransomware-based extortion. To better understand the impact of cryptocurrencies on the cybersecurity landscape, we conduct a comparative analysis of cybersecurity metrics prior to and after the adoption of cryptocurrency using a series of connected software-use models in the presence of security externalities. In this framework, we endogenize the actions of both heterogeneous consumers and attackers, with entry of the latter being driven by both the size of the unpatched consumer population and, as a subset of it, the size of the ransom-paying consumer population. We first examine users’ adoption and patching behavior under both security scenarios. We explore how changes in attacker entry costs impact outcomes under both conventional and post-crypto ransomware threat landscapes. We show that ransomware scenarios may be more desirable than conventional ones when attacker entry costs are low, provided that the gains from entering with standard attacks under the ransomware scenario are not too high. However, under such scenarios, social welfare can increase under the same conditions that lead to larger ransoms being demanded and a higher expected total ransom being paid, which presents a conundrum to policymakers. We also examine the impact of market parameters associated with security losses from conventional attacks and residual losses when victims pay in ransomware attacks.This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.Funding: This work was partially supported by Insung Research Grant of KUBS, the LG Yonam Foundation (of Korea), and an award from the Georgia Institute of Technology Center of International Business Education and Research as part of its funded research program.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00969 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Industrial policies are widely used across the world. In practice, designing and implementing these policies is a complicated task. In this paper, we assess the long-term performance of different industrial policy instruments, which include production subsidies, investment subsidies, entry subsidies, and consolidation policies. To do so, we examine a recent industrial policy in China aiming to propel the country’s shipbuilding industry to the largest globally. Using firm-level data from 1998 to 2014 and a dynamic model of firm entry, exit, investment, and production, we find that (i) the policy boosted China’s domestic investment, entry, and international market share dramatically, but delivered low returns and led to fragmentation, idle capacity, as well as depressed world ship prices; (ii) the effectiveness of different policy instruments is mixed: production and investment subsidies can be justified by market share considerations, while entry subsidies are wasteful; (iii) counter-cyclical policies, firm-targeting, and shortening the intervention horizon can substantially reduce distortions. Our results highlight the critical role of firm heterogeneity, business cycles, and firms’ cost structure in policy design. Finally, when exploring potential rationales, we find support for nonclassical considerations, such as reducing freight rates to boost Chinese trade.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Employers in online labor marketplaces prefer women over men because of stereotypes that women are more trustworthy. These stereotypes are especially salient in this context because of the uncertainty in online transactions. Yet, employers’ interactions with women and men workers might moderate the influence of trustworthiness stereotypes and, by extension, employers’ hiring preferences for individual women and men as well as gender categories in general. By exploiting rare access to large-scale, longitudinal hiring data from an online labor marketplace, we examine how employers’ interactions with workers shape their subsequent hiring preferences. Using linear probability models with job fixed effects, we find that employers prefer rehiring workers with whom they previously had positive interactions over unknown workers. Men workers benefit more than women workers from positive interactions, suggesting that these interactions decrease the influence of negative stereotypes about men’s trustworthiness. We additionally find that employers prefer hiring workers of the same gender as workers with whom they previously had positive interactions, suggesting that employers’ interactions with individual women and men shape their preferences for hiring women and men in general. These findings point to a nuanced theoretical relationship between employers’ interactions with workers and their social category preferences in hiring under conditions of immense uncertainty.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17383 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leading retailers have opened up their online storefronts to competitors by operating marketplaces for third-party sellers. We develop a model of entry and price competition at the product market level to analyze the competitive interactions arising within these retailer-led marketplaces. We show that the retailer benefits from the marketplace by mitigating his own capacity constraints and manages competition from third-party sellers through his control of the storefront: by setting the marketplace fee, by steering consumers, and by allocating his own capacity in response to the product supply choices of third-party sellers. We draw managerial implications and examine policy interventions. We find that regulation of marketplace fees has the strongest potential to increase welfare outcomes. Our model provides novel insights into the mechanisms at play in retailer-led marketplaces and explains their prominent role in online retail.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by H2020 European Research Council [Grant FAPoD 101044072]; Fundación Carmen y Severo Ochoa [Grant CEX2019-000915-S]; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad [Grant RYC-2016-20307]; BBVA Foundation grant within program “Ayudas Fundacion BBVA a Equipos de Investigacion Cientifica 2019.”</content>

    <title>Does Sponsored Search Advertising Augment Organic Search? Evidence from an E-Commerce Platform</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides empirical evidence on the performance of sponsored search advertising in a case study of an unnamed e-commerce platform. I leverage a field experiment that blocks all sponsored search advertising for 3% of site visitors. The experiment shows that sponsored search advertising both steals business from organic listings and also reduces the total volume of transactions intermediated by the platform. However, in this case study, I find that sponsored search is nonetheless profitable for the platform because ad revenue more than compensates for the reduction in commissions that the platform earns on transactions.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04792 .</content>

    <title>A Blessing or a Curse? Teletriage Service in Healthcare</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Teletriage is a telehealth service that uses telecommunication technologies to remotely assess patients’ conditions and determine their needs for medical treatment. This paper examines how teletriage affects patients’ decisions to seek treatment and when healthcare providers (e.g., medical businesses, hospitals, or clinics) should launch teletriage services. Our findings reveal that teletriage can encourage more mild patients to seek treatment, discouraging more severe patients. This occurs when teletriage lacks sufficient precision and patients’ hassle cost of seeking treatment falls outside a moderate range. Specifically, when hassle costs are low, patients are generally inclined to seek treatment, but teletriage can misclassify severe patients, leading them to avoid necessary care. Conversely, when hassle costs are high, patients tend to stay home, yet teletriage can misidentify mild patients, prompting them to seek unnecessary treatment. As a result, even if teletriage is costless, healthcare providers may abandon this service even though teletriage always increases patient surplus by improving their assessment of their medical needs. Interestingly, patients can be better off seeking treatment from providers who charge higher prices as these providers are more likely to adopt teletriage services. These results caution healthcare policymakers that teletriage can exacerbate healthcare inefficiency instead of alleviating it. Nevertheless, to improve patient surplus, the government should sometimes subsidize providers to offer teletriage or allow providers to charge a higher treatment fee.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 71821001, 72325005] and the Blanche “Peg” Philpott Professorship.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03292 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managing chronic diabetes care is a major challenge faced by healthcare organizations because it requires resource commitment over a long duration, high levels of patient engagement in the care process, and the socioeconomic and racial diversity of the patient population significantly affect care outcomes. Therefore, it is important to personalize chronic care treatment to improve chronic care outcomes. We propose a decision framework for the predictive management of diabetes that can help reduce the population‐level risk of diabetes. We use machine learning on clinical measures, demographics, and socioeconomic status of a large patient population from a chain of clinics in the Midwestern United States to predict the future health conditions of individual diabetes patients. Furthermore, we use the predictive analytic model outcome to build a decision analytic framework to optimally allocate encounters to individual patients. Also, we propose a heuristic solution to the optimal resource allocation model for implementation purposes. We make theoretical and methodological contributions by identifying and combining clinical, demographic, and socioeconomic factors to predict future diabetes risk for patients and demonstrate the use of the predicted risks for optimal resource utilization. Another significant contribution is demonstrating that a data‐driven predictive encounter allocation, considering the socioeconomic and demographic factors influencing health risks across patient populations, can promote more equitable healthcare delivery. Finally, we discuss implementation issues and actions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this research, we examine the common practice of employee performance rating calibration, the process in which calibration committee members discuss, compare, and potentially adjust direct supervisors' initial employee performance ratings. Calibration introduces an additional step into the performance evaluation process aimed at correcting for any incompleteness, inconsistencies, or biases in the ratings. By empirically studying archival, survey, and demographic data from 737 employees and 114 direct supervisors from our participating company, we examine the incentive conflicts between direct supervisors and the remainder of the calibration committee and their effect on the calibration process outcomes. We predict and find evidence consistent with direct supervisors being strategic in the information they share in the calibration process, which results in reduced information sharing. We also examine whose ratings are adjusted. While there is pressure on calibration committees to make sufficient adjustments, not every supervisor's employee performance ratings need to be adjusted. We find that those direct supervisors who have lower costs associated with avoiding scrutiny and defending against adjustments in the calibration process, ceteris paribus, receive fewer adjustments and end up with higher ratings, even when controlling for employee performance. Our investigation sheds light on the complexities of the calibration process, thereby providing important insights to HR managers responsible for managing the process.</content>

    <title>Exploring Cultural Differences in &lt;scp&gt;AI&lt;/scp&gt;‐Based Interviews: Innovativeness and Justice Perceptions Among Job Applicants in the United States and South Korea</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is rapidly integrated into the recruiting process across cultures. However, the extent to which job applicants' responses to AI‐based recruitment vary across cultures remains unexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a cross‐cultural examination on job applicants' perceptions of justice and innovativeness of AI‐based interviews, focusing on American and South Korean cultures. Using scenario experiments, we found that Americans generally perceived AI‐based interviews as less fair than human‐based interviews regarding job relatedness, chance to perform, and two‐way communication. In contrast, Koreans showed little difference in justice perceptions between AI‐based and human‐based interviews, and they even perceived AI‐based interviews as fairer in certain justice dimensions, such as the chance to perform. Both American and Korean participants regarded AI‐based interviews as more innovative than human‐based interviews. Additionally, we found that Americans' lower perceptions of justice, such as job relatedness and two‐way communication, accounted for the negative impact of AI‐based interviews on organizational attractiveness. However, Koreans' higher perceptions of the chance to perform and innovativeness led to higher organizational attractiveness in AI‐based interviews compared to that in human‐based interviews. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of culture in understanding job applicants' responses toward AI‐based interviews. Based on these findings, we discuss implications, limitations, and future suggestions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Higher-order beliefs—beliefs about others’ beliefs—may be important for trading behavior and asset prices but have received little systematic empirical examination. Examining more than 20 years of evidence from the Robert Shiller Investor Confidence surveys, we find that investors’ higher-order beliefs provide substantial motivations for nonfundamental speculation–taking a stock market position that conflicts with one’s valuation of the market. To explore the equilibrium implications, we construct a model that matches the survey evidence and highlights that investors’ higher-order beliefs amplify stock market overreaction and excess volatility.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The U.S. stock market’s return during the first month of a quarter correlates strongly with returns in future months, but the correlation is negative if the future month is the first month of a quarter, and positive if it isn’t. These correlations offset, consistent with the well-known near-zero unconditional autocorrelation, yet they are pervasive, present across industries and countries. The pattern accords with a model in which investors extrapolate announced earnings to predict future earnings, not recognizing that earnings in the first month of a quarter are discretely less predictable than in prior months. Survey data support the model. (JEL G12, G14, G40)</content>

    <title>Network-Motivated Forbearance Lending</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper develops a theoretical framework for network-motivated forbearance lending, or forbearance lending to influential buyers and sellers in a supply network. Because dominant banks in a financial market internalize the negative externality of an influential firm’s exit, they may continue to refinance a loss-making influential firm at an interest rate lower than the prime rate. This type of forbearance lending is distinct from other strategies such as evergreening or gambling for resurrection, and we show that network-motivated forbearance lending is independent of the financial soundness of the bank and can be welfare improving. To evaluate the extent of the externality of an influential seller or buyer, we propose two measures: the price influence coefficient and the demand influence coefficient, respectively.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the Seimeikai Foundation; the Seoul National University Institute of Economic Research, Housing and Commercial Bank Economic Research Fund; the Nomura Foundation; and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [Grants 15K01217, 16K13367, 17K03818, 20K20511, 23243050, 26245037, 26590051].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00459 .</content>

    <title>Does Employer-Paid, Job-Protected Maternity Leave Help or Hurt Female IT Workers? Evidence from Millions of Job Applications</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Paid maternity leave is considered an important pathway to increasing women’s participation in information technology (IT), as it helps address work-family balance concerns, which are pronounced in the field due to long hours, travel, and the need to keep up with technology. Many governments require that employers pay for maternity leave. Using microlevel data on millions of applications from an online job portal, our study examines whether a policy change in India that expanded employer-paid, job-protected maternity leave for companies with 10 or more employees from short-term (12 weeks) to medium-term (26 weeks) changes companies’ likelihood of considering female applicants for IT jobs. Specifically, postlegislation, we expect that less profitable companies may penalize women in the hiring process because employers must bear the costs associated with providing maternity benefits; we find that women were ∼22% less likely to be invited for an interview, postlegislation, at companies with low profitability. Moreover, at such companies, we do not observe a postlegislation change in applications by women. These results identify an important source of leakage in the pipeline for female IT workers. Additionally, our study suggests that legislation which mandates that maternity leave be paid for by employers (50% of economies that guarantee maternity leave of 14 weeks or longer require that employers fully or partially pay for maternity leave) should be accompanied by the introduction and enforcement of associated laws and guardrails—for example, parental leave and antidiscriminatory laws—to ensure that the spirit of the maternity leave legislation is upheld.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: Financial support from the National Science Foundation [Award 2151311] and Bright Data [in-kind contributions] is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.00380 .</content>

    <title>Mitigating the Negative Effects of Customer Anxiety by Facilitating Access to Human Contact</title>
    <updated>2025-03-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research in social psychology has shown that when people feel anxious, they seek advice from others. Yet, companies that operate in high-anxiety settings (like financial services, healthcare, and education) are increasingly deploying self-service technologies (SSTs), through which anxious customers transact without access to human contact. These companies may therefore face a classic efficiency–service trade-off where gains in operational efficiency through automation also hamper service outcomes by neglecting customer anxiety. This paper, set in the high-anxiety domain of financial services, investigates the value of facilitating access to human contact during SST usage. In a field experiment conducted within the context of a credit union’s SST loan-approval process, an invitation to connect with a human loan agent increases the customer uptake rate of approved loans by 24%. Subsequent controlled laboratory experiments, which explicitly investigate the linkages among anxiety, choice satisfaction, and firm trust during SST encounters show that compared with participants without anxiety, those who are anxious consistently report lower satisfaction with their choices and less trust in the firm, regardless of the source of their anxiety. When anxiety is related to the SST encounter, facilitating access to human contact dampens anxiety’s negative effects on choice satisfaction and, by extension, increases firm trust. We further observe that these benefits of facilitating access to human contact arise even though very few customers choose to access a person. Taken together, this research reveals an opportunity for firms to maintain operational efficiency in high-anxiety self-service settings without compromising customer experiences and service outcomes.This paper was accepted by Charles Corbett, operations management.Funding: Funding for this research, apart from internal business costs incurred by our field study partner to support the experiment, was primarily provided by Harvard Business School and partially provided by Dartmouth College.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01029 .</content>

    <title>Expanding the Caring Capacity: An Integrative Review of Nontraditional Caregiving and the Workplace Caregiving Literature</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Management scholarship has long explored how life outside of work impacts work, and it has accumulated rich theoretical insights on how being a mother or father impacts one’s job and the organization. Importantly, however, this literature has adopted a limited scope of who and what caregiving embodies, overlooking the millions of workers globally who find themselves caring for a parent, a person with a disability, or someone who faces unique marginalization. We use new research on nontraditional caregiving (NTC) roles to enrich the topic of caregiving more broadly. As such, we provide an integrative review of 353 multidisciplinary workplace articles to detail the workplace outcomes explored in the literature and identify four caregiving dimensions that cannot be fully understood by a traditional caregiving framework alone. Further, we build a multilevel framework that identifies novel processes across roles, thereby bridging the nontraditional and traditional caregiving literatures and introducing ways to redirect future research. Overall, this review aims to show that caregiving should be viewed more broadly than it is currently, and this review aims to build a foundation for better understanding the complexities of caregiving in all its forms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The reordering of transactions from “high‐to‐low” is a controversial bank practice thought to maximize fees paid by low‐income customers on overdrawn accounts. We exploit a series of class‐action lawsuits that mandated that some banks cease the practice. Using alternative credit bureau data, we find that after banks cease high‐to‐low reordering, low‐income individuals reduce payday borrowing, increase consumption, realize long‐term improvements in financial health, and gain access to lower‐cost loans in the traditional financial system. These findings suggest that aggressive bank practices can create demand for alternative financial services and highlight an important link between the traditional and alternative financial systems.</content>

    <title>Tournaments of Destruction: Consumers Battling for Visibility</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research introduces tournaments of destruction, defined as staged and ritualized social performances involving entertainment and competitive rivalry in which consumers destroy valued material objects before a focused gathering. The conceptualization of tournaments of destruction is borne from a qualitative, phenomenological-based case study of low-income, low-power Black African male youth, who as members of the Izikhothane subculture in Soweto, South Africa, battle powerless anonymity by engaging in conspicuous consumption and the counterintuitive conspicuous destruction of high-end Italian apparel brands. Alexander’s theory of social performance provides an enabling lens to explore tournaments of destruction within a system of meanings, and findings provide insights about motivation to participate in a destructive subculture, the social performance of tournaments of destruction, and the agency and navigation of visibility within their hyper-local community. Emergent themes of spatiotemporal visibility, intentionality of destruction, focused gatherings and collective effervescence, and sociomoral condemnation contribute to understanding tournaments of destruction and other destructive enactments by social collectives both in pre-market and contemporary societies. This research extends Alexander’s theory of social performance and provides grounding for future work on destruction and visibility within contemporary consumer culture.</content>

    <title>How Algorithms Constrain Consumer Experience</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior literature is yet to explain how algorithms systematically constrain consumer experience (CX). To address this issue, we conducted a multi-method ethnographic study of consumers using fitness tracking software. We draw on the information science literature to demonstrate that the constitutive properties of information technology (IT) that underlie algorithms result in a set of restrictive fundamental interactional mechanisms imposed through algorithmic logics of legibility (what is selectively registered as input), visibility (what is selectively represented in output), and legitimacy (normative commitments embedded in input and output choices). We find that these mechanisms systematically constrain the distinct dimensions of the CX construct by eliciting consumption work. Consumers perform cognitive work to think through algorithmic limitations, practical work to accommodate those limitations, relational work to clarify algorithmic misrepresentation, and affective work to deal with algorithmic delegitimization. We make two contributions. First, our emergent framework not only demonstrates how algorithms systematically constrain CX, but is also more broadly relevant to consumer research because it enables accounting for the agency of IT. Second, we provide a corrective to the passive, emotion focused, view of CX by demonstrating how the consumption work of accommodating algorithmic limitations constrains the distinct dimensions of the CX construct.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Strategy research has long been concerned with how firms build on the technological knowledge they create, and has focused on legal enforcement, complementary assets, and location decisions. Less attention has been paid to how internal firm structures support the appropriation of future cumulative innovations: what has been termed “generative appropriability.” Drawing on innovation and social network research, we propose that more integrated intrafirm inventor networks, and those with nearly decomposable structures, facilitate generative appropriability by accelerating within‐firm generation of follow‐on innovations, thus outpacing rivals. We find evidence for these effects in patent data from 1417 large corporations over 26 years. The acceleration effect is strongest in the critical first few years after an initial invention.Managerial SummaryInnovation is a cumulative and competitive process, so if firms fail to build on their own innovations quickly, rivals will capture value by doing so. We study how the degree to which a firm's inventors are connected to each other through co‐patenting relationships is related to its ability to build on its prior innovations faster than rivals. We find that firms whose researchers are connected to more of its other researchers are better able to quickly develop follow‐on innovations, but this advantage decays over time. We also find that the pattern of connectedness most associated with this outcome is one in which tight clusters of researchers in the core of the network are linked to each other by “bridging ties.”</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Managerial mental representations (MMRs) are mental constructs that structure cognitive content to guide perception and interpretation. MMRs have been examined across a broad spectrum of management research contexts, leading to the use of numerous related terms such as “mental representation,” “schema,” “mental model,” “cognitive frame,” “cognitive map,” and “mindset.” This proliferation of terms has caused considerable definitional overlap and ambiguity. To foster definitional clarity, this review systematically analyzes 206 articles employing any of 33 MMR terms used during the past 30 years. We identify the conceptual and functional definition facets of MMRs and use them to analyze commonalities and differences among the most prominent MMR terms. We further examine both established and emerging discussions surrounding the characteristics of MMRs. Established discussions focus on MMR content and levels of analysis, while emerging discussions explore MMR permanence and implicitness. We propose suggestions to advance each conversation. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we create a guiding framework aiding future research to conceptualize MMRs and navigate terminology choices. Finally, we propose two future research directions: integrating the content and process perspectives on MMRs and applying an MMR lens to examine the emergence of artificial intelligence in organizations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines venture capital's (VC) role in the geographic clustering of high‐growth startups. We exploit a rule change that disproportionately impacted U.S. regions that historically lacked VC financing via a restriction of banks to invest in the asset class. A one‐standard‐deviation increase in VCs' exposure to the rule led to a 20% decline in fund size and a 10% decrease in the likelihood of raising a follow‐on fund. Startups were not wholly cushioned: financing and valuations declined. Startups also moved out of impacted states after the rule change, likely exacerbating existing geographic disparity in entrepreneurship.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We exploit quasi-exogenous variation in passive ownership around the Russell 1000/2000 cutoff to explore the causal effects of passive ownership on the securities lending market. We find that passive ownership causes an increase in lendable supply and short interest, while lending fees remain largely unchanged. The utilization ratio—ie, the ratio of short interest over lendable supply—goes up, implying that shorting demand increases more than lendable supply. We argue that this additional demand results from an increase in the quality of lendable supply as passive funds are less likely to recall stock loans. This higher supply quality attracts informed short sellers, who improve the information efficiency around negative news releases and correct overpricing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ethnically diverse countries are more prone to conflict, but why do some groups engage in conflict, while others do not? I show that civil conflict in Africa is explained by ethnic groups’ cultural distance to the central government: an increase in cultural distance, proxied by linguistic distance, increases an ethnicity’s propensity to fight over government power. To identify this effect, I leverage within-ethnicity variation in linguistic distance resulting from power transitions between ethnic groups over time. I provide evidence that the effects can be attributed to differences in preferences over both the allocation and the type of public goods. (JEL D74, H41, J15, N47, O15, O17, Z13)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper explores global perceptions and understanding of climate change and policies, examining factors that influence support for climate action and the impact of different types of information. We conduct large-scale surveys with 40,000 respondents from 20 countries, providing new international data on attitudes toward climate change and respondents’ socioeconomic backgrounds and lifestyles. We identify three key perceptions affecting policy support: perceived effectiveness of policies in reducing emissions, their impact on low-income households, and their effect on respondents’ households (self-interest). Educational videos clarifying policy mechanisms increase support for climate policies; those merely highlighting climate change’s impacts do not. (JEL C83, D83, D91, Q54, Q58)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We introduce a new model of stochastic choice that assigns each choice option a utility, along with a salience parameter reflecting economic frictions. We characterize our model behaviorally and investigate its comparative statics properties. We show that the model generates intuitive closed-form solutions in equilibrium settings where firms can choose price, quality, and advertising. In addition, we show that the model allows for flexible substitution patterns and changes in market shares across choice sets. We demonstrate that our model can be easily identified and can outperform alternatives in demand prediction. (JEL D11, D21, D43, M37)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The transition toward an intangible-intensive economy reshapes financial systems by creating a self-perpetuating savings glut in the production sector. As intangibles become increasingly important, firms hoard liquidity to finance investment in intangibles of limited pledgeability. Firms’ savings feed cheap leverage to financial intermediaries and allow intermediaries to bid up asset prices, which in turn encourages firms to save more for asset creation. This paper develops a macrofinance model that offers a coherent account of rising corporate savings, debt-fueled growth of intermediaries, declining interest rates, and rising asset valuation. Along these secular trends, endogenous financial risk accumulates. (JEL E43, E44, G12, G21, G31, G32)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I present a new theory of oligopoly and markups in general equilibrium, based on an innovative, scalable hedonic demand system, which I take to the data for the universe of US public firms. In my model, firms compete in a network of product market rivalries that emerge endogenously out of the characteristics of the products they supply. I estimate that consumer surplus is almost three times as large as profits; decompose firm-level markups into metrics of quality-adjusted productivity and market centrality; and analyze the extent, evolution, and drivers of monopoly power in the United States between 1995 and 2021.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides an economic perspective on data-driven innovation in digital products, focusing on the role of complex experiments in measuring and improving social impact. The discussion highlights how tools and insights from economics contribute to each stage of the innovation process. Key contributions include identifying problems, developing theoretical frameworks, translating goals into measurable outcomes, analyzing historical data, and estimating counterfactual outcomes. The paper also surveys recently developed tools designed to address challenges in designing and analyzing data from complex experiments. (JEL A11, D83, D91, I20, L80, O31, Q16)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How quickly does a fiat money become valueless? I study the speculative hyperinflation equilibria of continuous-time economies with decentralized markets where money is essential. I establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which money dies in finite time. A necessary condition is that the liquidity return of money grows unbounded as the value of money approaches zero. Under CRRA preferences, the longevity of money shrinks with the money growth rate and the frequency of liquidity needs, but it increases with seller’s market power. Money duration also depends on the strictness of legal restrictions and the rates of return of competing currencies. (JEL E31, E42, E51, E52, E62)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper identifies a credit-supply contraction that arises endogenously after trade liberalization. Banks with loan portfolios concentrated in sectors exposed to competition from China face an increase in nonperforming loans after China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. As a result, they reduce the supply of credit to firms, irrespective of the firm’s sector of operation. This cut in credit translates into lower employment, investment, and output. Through this mechanism, the financial channel amplifies the shock to firms already hit by import competition from China and passes it on to firms in sectors expected to expand upon trade liberalization.

    <title>EXPRESS: Optimal Processing and Trading for a Commodity in the Presence of Inventory Conversion Flexibility and Random Supply</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this paper, we present a decision support system used by an agricultural cooperative in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to purchase, blend, sell, and store groundnut to maximize profits. The cooperative purchases raw groundnuts (input commodity) from its member-farmers, which is then processed to obtain multiple grades of groundnut seeds (output commodity). After the processing, two grades may be blended to obtain an intermediate grade to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. The cooperative then sells some or all the output commodity in the spot market and carries the remaining inventory to the following period. It faces the problem of determining the quantity of input commodity to process and the quantity of different grades of output commodity to blend and, subsequently, sell in every period. The novel features of the problem are that the supply of input commodity is random every period, which is caused by the obligation of the cooperative to purchase all the supply that its members bring, and the option to blend grades to create intermediate ones. The possibility of blending over a multi-period planning horizon has not been examined yet in the operations management literature on commodities. We formulate the problem as a dynamic program over a harvest season and use the associated framework to identify structural properties of the optimal value function and optimal decisions. We show that the optimal value function is not separable in the input inventory and the output inventory vector. This makes the identification of the optimal solution challenging. In special cases, the value function may have a simpler form, for example, when blending is not permitted. We develop an efficient procedure to compute the optimal decisions in the general case. We illustrate the benefits of blending and using a multi-period model, employing data obtained from a cooperative: the net profit of the cooperative could improve by 100-900% depending upon the model parameters, which translates to Indian National Rupees 1.94-17.46 million per annum.</content>

    <title>Undiversity, Inequity, and Exclusion in Supply Chains: The Unintended Fallout of Economic Sanctions and Consumer Boycotts</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economic sanctions and consumer boycotts are common tools to punish organizations for undesirable behavior and attempt to coerce them to change their actions. However, these tools occasionally spill over beyond the intended recipients and affect guiltless supply chain members, jeopardizing the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion in supply chains. This study identifies four channels through which sanctions and boycotts propagate through supply chains. In particular, supply chain members can be affected by direct relationships with targeted organizations, disruptions in accessing foreign markets, inability to access technology, and logistics failures. Potential solutions include mapping supply chains, proactive cooperation, network analysis, and shortening supply chains. While the work provides a general framework for research and practitioners, it also identifies areas for further studies, such as the role of new technologies and the effect of sanctions and boycotts on supply chain sustainability.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Protecting Workers from Rude Customers to Enhance Organizational Identification in Emotional Labor Environments: a Study with Call Center Agents</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Challenges faced by call centers in managing capacity, efficiency, service speed and quality, training, emotional labor, and turnover are intrinsically intertwined. Call center agents are considered frontline workers, and as such, they often deal with hostile behavior from rude customers. However, they are expected to suppress their feelings and maintain a courteous demeanor despite rude customer behavior, which results in emotional dissonance. Such working environments, where the frontline workers experience emotional dissonance, are termed emotional labor environments. Emotional dissonance, if sustained over a long period of time, can lead to an erosion of organizational identification (OID) amongst agents, unless they perceive adequate protection and support from the management. A low OID can lead to high employee turnover, which in turn results in high recruitment and training costs as well as loss of experience and compromised service quality. In this study, we examine how employee protection policies and leadership style manifest in mitigating the erosion of OID. We develop a research framework to understand the mediating role of agents' perception of the efficacy of the firm's policies to protect them from rude customers and the relevant aspects of the servant leadership style of supervisors in mitigating the erosion of agents' OID caused by the cumulative emotional dissonance over their tenure duration. For this study, we partner with a major multinational firm in Korea in the insurance industry. We find that the perceived organizational support for protection from rude customers and supervisors' servant leadership style are positively related to agents' OID. The agent's OIDdecreaseswith their tenure duration, unless mediated by the agent's perception of the efficacy of protection from rude customers. We provide insights for the retention of agents with implications for capacity and service quality for the call centers. These insights may be extended to frontline workers in other emotional labor environments.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Strategizing Value-Added Services for Platform Firms</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Platform firms are increasingly investing in value-added services (VAS), believing these investments in VAS universally contribute to their success. Although many studies have examined platform firms’ core services (e.g., intermediation), systematic analyses of VAS provision strategies remain limited. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretic model to analyze (1) the conditions under which platform firms benefit from providing VAS and (2) to which side(s) platform firms should provide VAS. We offer several insights. First, variable service costs are a critical yet previously neglected factor in governing platform firms’ VAS provision. Second, a comparison of equilibrium outcomes across three VAS provision strategies—one-sided unidirectional, two separate unidirectional, and bidirectional—reveals that the optimal strategy is jointly determined by variable service costs, cross-network externalities, and the asymmetry in the benefits of bidirectional VAS to the two platform sides. Specifically, when asymmetry is low, bidirectional VAS is optimal. When asymmetry is high, platform firms should provide unidirectional VAS to one side, considering the second side only when variable service costs are low or cross-network externalities are significant. Third, we explore the implications of VAS provision strategies for platform firms’ investment and pricing decisions. For example, when platform firms provide two separate unidirectional VAS, these investments are complementary. VAS could incentivize platform firms to offer price subsidies to one side of the platform. Finally, optimal VAS provision strategies do not always increase consumer surplus.</content>

    <title>Rationally Trust, but Emotionally? The Roles of Cognitive and Affective Trust in Laypeople's Acceptance of AI for Preventive Care Operations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare operations. Nevertheless, particularly in the context of preventive care, little is known about how laypeople perceive and accept AI and change their behavior accordingly. Grounded in a solid theoretical framework of trust, this study bridges this gap by exploring individuals’ acceptance of AI‐based preventive health interventions and following health behavior change, which is critical for preventive care providers’ operational and business performance. Through a randomized field experiment with 15,000 users of a mobile health app complemented by a survey, we first show that the use and disclosure of AI in preventive health interventions improve their effectiveness. However, individuals are less likely to accept and achieve the health behavior change suggested by AI than when they receive similar interventions from health experts. We also observe that the effectiveness of AI‐based interventions can be improved by combining them with human expert opinions, increasing their algorithmic transparency, or emphasizing their genuine care and warmth. These results collectively suggest that, different from conventional technologies, AI's deficient affective trust, rather than comparable cognitive trust, play a decisive role in the acceptance of AI‐based preventive health interventions. This study sheds light on the literature on the role of new‐age information technologies in behavioral operations management, consumer marketing, and healthcare as well as the role of trust in technology acceptance. Valuable practical implications for more effective management of AI for preventive care operations and promotion of consumers’ health behavior are also provided.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the relation between political uncertainty arising from state-level election cycles and the timing of employee dismissal and plant closure notices filed by U.S. firms under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act of 1988 (hereafter, WARN notices). We appeal to a real options framework to predict that firms delay layoff decisions and the issuance of WARN notices until the resolution of political uncertainty. Using establishment-level data on layoffs disclosed in WARN notices and state elections occurring between 1994 and 2022, we document that the likelihood of issuing WARN notices declines during the election quarter but increases in the subsequent quarter. Cross-sectional findings show that political uncertainty plays a significant role in the timing of WARN notices during election periods while other factors, including partisanship, economic conditions, union strength, and firm visibility, may also play a role. Further, firms that delay WARN notices do not experience a significant deterioration in their medium-term financial performance. Overall, our findings provide evidence that firms delay labor adjustment decisions and the announcements of such decisions in response to political uncertainty.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Business‐to‐business (B2B) sellers are increasingly transitioning to hybrid sales structures, by augmenting an in‐person field sales force with a direct online channel. During this transition, sellers frequently experience a cold‐start problem, wherein existing customers are either not acquainted with the online channel or unconvinced of its usefulness and are therefore reluctant to adopt it. To overcome the cold‐start problem, B2B sellers are increasingly relying ononline sales pushes, which are efforts to encourage salespeople to nudge customers to adopt the online channel for certain buying tasks. Yet, because salespeople may fear that the online channel adoption jeopardizes the very relationships that they painstakingly built, the salespeople's compliance with an online sales push remains unclear. To glean insight into this dilemma, we empirically investigate an online sales push's impact on salesperson effort (re)allocation and sales performance. Based on an econometric analysis of archival data from a B2B seller and a scenario‐based experiment, we conclude that salespeople generally tend to comply with an online sales push because it frees up their time and allows them to pursue new selling opportunities that have the potential to increase their compensation. The results also indicate that following an online sales push, salespeople expend their effort based on a customer's online proclivity and potential prior to the push. Moreover, the effort expended varies over time and across communication channels. Additionally, the analysis reveals (a) asymmetric carryover and cross‐channel effects of communication effort and sales performance and (b) asymmetric synergistic effects of communication effort on sales performance.</content>

    <title>Analytics for IoT‐Enabled Human–Robot Hybrid Sortation: An Online Optimization Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by a realworld practice of a China Post sortation center, this study considers the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) technology to improve the efficiency of a human–robot hybrid sortation system. In this system, IoT technology enables responsive adjustment of the manual capacity to alleviate the congestion effect of increasing parcel flow on robotic sorting efficiency. We begin with a predictive analysis of a real‐life dataset to quantify the congestion effect on robotic sorting efficiency, and examine the nonstationary behavior of the parcel flow process. Subsequently, we design an online algorithm using IoT advance information (which refers to advance observation of some parcel flows before their actual arrivals) for efficiently adjusting the manual capacity. We develop theoretical guarantee for the effectiveness of the online algorithm by bounding its regret, and also demonstrate that the long‐term expected regret rate is zero under mild conditions. Via extensive simulation experiments, we find that our online algorithm outperforms the China Post sortation center's current policy and conventional Markov dynamic program in terms of computational efficiency and solution quality. The simulation results also demonstrate that the value of IoT technology to the sortation center can be significant, and shed insights on IoT investment by revealing the diminishing return of expanding the horizon of IoT advance information.</content>

    <title>Smart Navigation Via Strategic Communications in a Mixed Autonomous Paradigm</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by the emerging mixed autonomous paradigm in cobotic order picking operations, we investigate the optimal information design to navigate human workers (HWs) who cooperate with autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) within an intralogistics system. We incorporate asymmetric information between AMRs and HWs in a routing game where connected AMRs are informed of the congestion state while HWs rely on information provided by the system. The system designs a communication policy aiming to navigate HWs away from congestion. Without strategic communications, we show that the deployment of AMRs cannot mitigate congestion unless the automation level reaches a threshold. Interestingly, we illustrate a substitution effect between automation and strategic communications when information distortion is mild. In contrast, severe information distortion complements automation due to exacerbated congestion. Furthermore, an in‐house AMR fleet is economically more efficient than a third‐party logistics service. Consequently, in‐house automation can be achieved with mild information distortion, while severe information distortion is required to complement the lack of efficiency in the third‐party AMR fleet. With simulated numerical examples to complement the analytical results, we provide managerial insights concerning the optimal information policies under different levels of automation, guiding warehouse managers in their communications with workers to achieve the best performance of the cobotic system.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Manufacturer’s Role in Nanostore-Supermarket Supply Chain Competition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We explore retail supply chains in emerging markets in which a manufacturer can reach consumers by selling its product through very small independent stores (nanostores) and/or through a supermarket. Nanostores offer consumers the advantage of proximity, but supermarkets offer the advantage of bulk buying. We explore the competition between the supermarket and nanostores and examine the manufacturer’s role in shaping the retail market structure for its product through wholesale price contracts. We model and analyze a multi-party supply-chain game in which a manufacturer can sell its product to spatially-distributed, utility-maximizing, price-sensitive consumers through nanostores and a supermarket. Consumers can buy in bulk at the supermarket, optimizing their purchase quantity, and hence visit frequency, in an Economic Order Quantity type approach, or they can purchase from a nanostore (frequently due to store storage-space limitations). We fully solve for the equilibrium market structure and the associated retail and wholesale prices, establishing that the manufacturer’s desired channel strategy is governed by three factors: the manufacturer-nanostore supply chain cost, the manufacturer-supermarket supply chain cost, and the supermarket bargaining power. If the supply chain efficiencies are somewhat similar, then the manufacturer should (typically, but not always) use both retail formats to avail of the nanostore advantage in serving proximate consumers and the supermarket advantage in serving distant customers. The specifics of how the manufacturer should use the retail formats will depend on the supermarket power. Among other results, we establish that aggregate nanostore demand and profit can decrease in nanostore density and that the presence of a high-power supermarket can increase consumer surplus because the manufacturer induces strong price competition.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Identifying Influential Users by Topic in Unstructured User-generated Content</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Social media users generate a variety of content that can potentially influence their followers’ behaviors and preferences. However, most user-generated content, such as text and images, is unstructured, making it difficult to analyze how individuals impact the creation of such data as existing models primarily focus on the numerical aspects of behavioral data. In this paper, we propose a method to identify influential users who significantly affect others’ interest in content topics, with a specific focus on text and images. Our study introduces a new variant of the topic model, incorporating a hierarchical structure and a vector auto-regressive approach. This method accounts for both the evolution of topic distribution and the social influence among users on their interest in content topics. The empirical application of our model to image-sharing social media data demonstrates that our model outperforms conventional topic models in terms of predictive accuracy and topic interpretability. Moreover, we illustrate how visualizing the estimated social influence within the network can provide valuable insights for seeded marketing campaigns and data-driven product development by identifying influential users in various content areas. This approach also offers a deeper understanding of evolving trends in content, preferences, and demand.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper summarizes emerging practice and research issues in the health insurance industry. We provide an industry overview, epitomize business analytics applications, and outline current and emerging problems of interest to key stakeholders and researchers in information systems, operations management, and healthcare management. Specifically, we focus on three areas of research that are of importance to the health insurance industry as well as the healthcare system: (i) management and evaluation of intervention programs, (ii) creation of effective provider networks, and (iii) emerging issues such as the impact of a pandemic, patient communication and steering, and technological innovations in health care. We lay out brief details of how each of these problems can be formulated, where the data can be acquired (public and/or proprietary data sets), and provide guidance for solving them. For several of these problems, we provide models that span causal modeling, predictive modeling, and prescriptive modeling.</content>

    <title>Shaping Ecosystem Rules: Complementarities, Interdependencies, and Firms’ Success in Coordinating Ecosystems Via Standard-Setting</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In ecosystems characterized by distributed authority, each firm competes with others to shape the ecosystem’s rules to its advantage while navigating complex interorganizational interdependencies. This creates a coordination problem best exemplified within consensus standards-setting organizations, where different firms present technical proposals and attempt to shape the specifications that dictate how the ecosystem’s technological components must work together. In this paper, we examine what factors determine a firm’s shaping success in such contexts by integrating two major perspectives, one rooted in interfirm social relations and the other that views an ecosystem as a structure of technological interdependence. In so doing, we identify a socio-technical trade-off between the extent of a firm’s relational influence and its efforts to shape core technical proposals (i.e., those that affect many interdependent ecosystem components). A firm with many existing relational ties holds influence that increases its success at shaping, but if such a firm’s proposals are at the core, some of its partners will invariably face high adjustment costs because of the proposal’s wide-ranging impact. Interestingly, a firm with greater prospects for engaging with future complementary partners does not face this trade-off and indeed benefits from shaping at the core. Additionally, value capture considerations also affect how other firms weigh these socio-technical trade-offs, with support for the firm’s shaping attempts dampened among potential future complementors but strengthened among current partners. We provide evidence for these arguments by applying machine-learning techniques on fine-grained data from two prominent wireless telecommunications standards. Our work brings a fresh perspective to a growing ecosystems literature by illuminating both social and technological factors that affect firms’ shaping success.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.16136 .</content>

    <title>Take Me Home, Country Roads: Return Migration and Platform-Enabled Entrepreneurship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the rise of digital platforms that connect rural entrepreneurs to urban customers, rural online businesses are hampered by a lack of talent. Some have pointed to the potentially enabling role of rural returnees. However, although international returnees bring valuable knowledge to businesses in their home countries, it is unclear how domestic returnees affect entrepreneurship in rural, underdeveloped parts of their country. We study this question using a natural experiment involving a regional policy change, which reduced the barriers for rural migrants to return home in one Chinese province but not in others. We find that, after the policy change, rural e-commerce businesses in the province that implemented the policy change enjoyed a 19% performance gain relative to those in other provinces. We theorize and test four mechanisms that may underlie the relationship between return migration and online entrepreneurship: knowledge transfer, demand spillover, de novo businesses, and financial support from returnees. Our results support the knowledge transfer mechanism, but we also find evidence of demand spillover. This study highlights the salience of return mobility and “return barriers” in shaping local entrepreneurship. It also suggests a novel approach toward fostering entrepreneurship in underdeveloped regions: policymakers and digital platforms may work together to pave the country roads that take people home.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2021.16002 .</content>

    <title>Revisiting the CEO Effect Through a Machine Learning Lens</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;An important debated topic in strategic management concerns the so-called “chief executive officer (CEO) effect,” which quantifies the impact that CEOs have on the performance of the firms that they lead. Prior literature has empirically investigated the CEO effect and found support for both theses: a significant effect and no effect at all. We note, however, that virtually all prior studies have relied on an empirical specification that leverages in-sample data, which could be unreliable in certain circumstances. In this paper, we utilize machine learning models and predictive analytics based on out-of-sample data to revisit the CEO effect. In particular, we operationalize the CEO effect as the gain in the out-of-sample predictive accuracy by adding the CEO information to the model input in addition to the firm information. By analyzing 1,245 firms and 1,779 CEOs over 20 years, we demonstrate that the results of the approach from the literature have limited external validity. More specifically, we convey that the analyses are purely based on in-sample data and that the predictive effects of CEOs are not substantive when out-of-sample test data sets are used. Although our main analysis relies on optimized distributed gradient boosting, we also conduct extensive robustness tests spanning close to 100 models with alternative algorithms and specifications, all of which yield consistent results.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03625 .</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: How Awe in Marketing Communications Decreases Consumer Preferences for Limited Edition Products</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Awe is commonly employed in marketing communications given its powerful ability to inspire consumers. Despite the prevalent use of awe in advertising limited edition (LE) products, research has yet to examine when and how awe can benefit or hurt these promotional efforts. Findings across nine studies demonstrate that awe typically has a negative impact on consumer engagement and product preferences toward LE items. This effect results from the reduced desire for exclusivity that a consumer has when experiencing awe. These findings are generalized to several contexts, including a field study of persuasive communications and consumer choices in a metaverse environment. However, awe can enhance consumer preferences toward LE products when promotional messages are framed to reduce this incongruence. We provide insights for marketers on the conditions under which incorporating awe in LE product campaigns might prove beneficial or counterproductive.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Artificial Intelligence on Call: The Physician's Decision of Whether to Use AI in Clinical Practice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Physicians are increasingly able to use artificial intelligence (AI) systems to aid their medical decision-making. This paper examines a physician’s decision regarding whether to use an assistive AI system when prescribing a treatment plan for a patient. Using AI helps the physician generate an informative signal that lessens clinical uncertainty. It can also change the physician’s legal liability in the event of patient harm. We analyze two patient-protection schemes that determine physician liability when using AI: the prevailing patient-protection scheme uses the AI signal to enforce the current standard of care, whereas an emerging scheme proposes using the AI signal as the new standard of care. We show that in both schemes, the physician has an incentive to use AI in low-uncertainty scenarios, even if AI provides little value. Furthermore, the physician may avoid using AI in higher-uncertainty scenarios where AI could have aided in better decision-making. As AI becomes more precise, the physician may become more hesitant to use it on certain patients. A comparison of the physician’s decision to use AI under the two schemes reveals that using the AI signal as the new standard of care may mitigate AI underuse (overuse) for certain patients but may boost AI underuse (overuse) for some other patients.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Strategic Change Capability in Marketing Organizations: Conceptualization, Scale Development, and Validation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In dynamic and uncertain business environments, marketing organizations need to be constantly ready to enact strategic changes. However, a robust measure for capturing the organizational capabilities and underlying marketing activities required to achieve effective marketing-related strategic changes is lacking. This study addresses this gap by developing a measurement tool for strategic change capability (SCC). Drawing on interviews with marketing consultants and senior marketing managers, the authors conceptualize SCC as a multidimensional dynamic marketing capability that comprises five dimensions: establishing the business case for change, preparing employees for change, setting up the organization for implementing change, institutionalizing change, and assessing and adjusting implementation. Following rigorous scale development procedures, including (1) item generation, (2) expert evaluation, (3) scale purification, (4) scale validity, (5) nomological and predictive validity, and (6) scale generalizability studies, a psychometrically sound and reliable measure of SCC is developed. The SCC scale facilitates different types of strategic marketing change and predicts performance outcomes better than established constructs (i.e., strategic flexibility, agility, adaptiveness, and responsiveness). This study contributes to the dynamic capabilities theory and provides empirically substantiated guidance for marketing organizations on how to prepare for and effectively enact strategic changes in dynamic business environments.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The sharing economy has become an increasingly widespread way for peers to rent out their owned goods to others seeking to rent them. This research investigates how providers (i.e., owners renting out their belongings) decide what price to charge, and identifies theprovider WTA effect, where in the context of a peer-to-peer (P2P) collaborative consumption model, providers are willing to accept (WTA)lessthan renters (i.e., non-owners) are willing to pay (WTP). These findings diverge from prior research which has repeatedly demonstrated that owners typically demand more to part with their belongings than non-owners are willing to pay in a seller/buyer transaction (i.e., the endowment effect). Theprovider WTA effectis explained by providers having a more accessible empathy lens which in turn acts to dampen the accessibility of their exchange lens when renting out their item. This drives WTA below WTP. The effect is moderated when the renter is identified as a dissimilar transaction partner. This research provides actionable implications for providers and platforms.</content>

    <title>Do the People Make the Place? A 40-Year Review of Research on ASA Theory</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Attraction-selection-attrition (ASA) theory proposes that “the people make the place” and has served as a foundation for many areas of organizational research. In this review, we take stock of the ASA literature to identify what we know and what we need to know about ASA processes and their effects on organizations. Based on a review of over 6,000 articles that cited ASA, we identified 321 studies that used the theory as a basis for their hypotheses. However, only 77 (24%) of those studies actually tested an aspect of the theory. For example, although ASA is an organizational-level theory, most studies used the theory to test phenomena at other levels, such as individuals, teams, or occupations. Among studies that did test the theory, very few directly assessed its core hypotheses. For instance, only one published study directly tested the central hypothesis that ASA processes lead to homogeneity. Moreover, some parts of the theory were not supported. As an example, although the theory suggests that ASA processes will reduce organizational effectiveness, several studies found that homogeneity was associated with better performance. Although the amount of empirical support for ASA theory was uneven, we believe it still has the potential to help understand organizations and the people that make them. To that end, we provide an agenda for future research that prioritizes how to best test ASA’s core hypotheses. We also highlight connections between ASA and other theories and literatures that examine similar phenomena to inspire future research opportunities.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While extensive research has examined the relationship between human resource management systems and organizational performance, the impact of organizational-level training—defined as the quantity and quality of training that an organization provides to its employees—remains less understood. In this article, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relationship between organizational-level training and organizational performance to determine the magnitude of the relationship and test a set of moderators of the relationship. Grounded in human capital theory, our meta-analysis employs a theoretically driven moderator analysis to identify the conditions under which organizational-level training significantly influences organizational performance. The results from 159 studies (N = 75,033) show that the relationship between organizational-level training and organizational performance is positive and significant (ρ= .13, SDρ= .17, 95% CI [.11, .16]). More importantly, the effect size differs significantly across several theoretical (e.g., training dimensions, type of human capital, outcome dimensions, and timing of measurement) and contextual (e.g., industry knowledge intensity, firm age, and region) moderators. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.</content>

    <title>The green sin: how exchange rate volatility and financial openness affect green premia</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a model with mean-variance foreign investors who exhibit a convex disutility associated to brown bond holdings. The model predicts that bond green premia should be smaller in economies with more closed financial accounts and highly volatile exchange rates. This happens because foreign intermediaries invest relatively less in such economies, and this lowers the marginal disutility of investing in polluting activities. We find strong empirical evidence in favor of this hypothesis using a global bond market dataset. Exchange rate volatility and financial account openness are thus able to explain the higher financing costs of green projects in emerging markets relative to advanced economies, especially when green bonds are denominated in local currency: a disadvantage that we can call the “green sin” of emerging economies.</content>

    <title>The Adoption of Central Bank Digital Currency</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the adoption of Central Bank digital currency (CBDC) in a partial equilibrium setting, focusing on four key features: remuneration, monetary incentives, interoperability, and architecture. Agents are interested in adopting CBDC because they have a preference for digital payments, and the Central Bank may incentivize adoption through subsidies and platform development, potentially in collaboration with the private sector. Our results demonstrate that both the remuneration scheme and monetary incentives significantly influence the adoption rate and transaction volume. Calibrating the model for the digital euro case study, we show that the target of 60% of the population using CBDC can be achieved, provided that platform productivity is substantially enhanced. Although this target is feasible within a one-layer architecture, it becomes significantly more challenging in a two-layer setting. CBDC is likely to win the adoption battle against stablecoins but is likely to lose it against debit cards.This paper has been This paper was accepted by Will Cong for the Special Issue on Digital Finance.Funding: This project has been partially funded by the European Union – Next Generation EU – PNRR project SERICS “Security and Rights in the CyberSpace” (PE00000014 – CUP B53C22003990006) – SPOKE 9.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01504 .</content>

    <title>Intentionality and Attentionality Dynamics in an Institutional Change Process</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article, we explore how actors' intentionality emerges, develops, and co‐evolves with institutional change. Although intentions are essential in shaping institutional change agents' motivations and actions, our understanding of their dynamics is limited and biased by the assumption that intentions are usually identifiable prior to institutional change. Building on the works of philosophers, in particular Husserl's life exploration of consciousness and intentions, we argue that a more effective way to conceptualize intentionality in institutional change is to consider attentionality, that is, how actors direct their mental focus toward specific elements of their social reality. Empirically, we draw upon a phenomenon‐driven study of the Algerian agricultural transformation from 2000 to 2019, with a focus on the contributions of Benamor, a leading agri‐food business. We theorize a process model that differentiates between passive and active intentions. Passive intentions are virtual mental possibilities upon which active intentions are built to instigate change. Our findings highlight attentional conversion as a crucial mechanism that drives the transition from passive to active intentions. These findings have important implications for our understanding of institutional change theories.</content>

    <title>Most Read Versus Most Shared: How Less (vs. More) Social Popularity Labels Influence News Media Consumption</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;News outlets commonly highlight the most popular content using different labels (e.g., “most read” and “most shared”). As prior research has found that people primarily consume news for information or entertainment, it is important to understand what these popularity labels convey about the information value and entertainment value of articles and how they shape consumers’ news preferences and decisions. Nine lab and field studies, including two in the web appendix, demonstrate that labels reflecting less social behavior (e.g., “most read”) signal higher information (vs. entertainment) value, while labels reflecting more social behavior (e.g., “most shared”) signal higher entertainment (vs. information) value. Thus, consumers with information motives prefer less social popularity labels, a stronger signal of information value. Conversely, consumers with entertainment motives prefer more social labels, a stronger signal of entertainment value. Notably, an analysis of 120 major media outlets revealed that many use labels that are misaligned with readers’ dominant motives or use no label at all, indicating considerable room for improvement. Reassuringly, this work finds that strategically using popularity labels can increase clicks by over 20%. This has implications for media outlets aiming to spur engagement as well as researchers and organizations concerned with information dissemination.</content>

    <title>Reparative Consumption: The Role of Racial Identity and White Guilt in Consumer Preferences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In light of recent social and political movements advocating for racial equity and calls for more research on interracial marketplace interactions, this research explores the role racial identity plays in the consumption domain. Specifically, we investigate the marketplace consequences of U.S.-based White consumers’ feelings about their own racial identity by measuring and manipulating white guilt, defined as the sense of guilt and remorse that emerges among White consumers who hold their racial ingroup responsible for historical and ongoing racial injustices and perceive that Whites, as a racial group, benefit from unearned privileges. Consistent with the reparation-oriented action profile of guilt, six studies (all pre-registered, two with incentive-compatible designs) show that white guilt motivates reparative behaviors toward Black-owned businesses in various service contexts: Consumers with high white guilt express greater willingness to patronize and promote a business when it is Black-owned (vs. White-owned, family-owned, or when there is no information on ownership) and feel more moral for doing so, whereas this effect is non-existent, or sometimes reversed, for those low in white guilt. Our findings reveal the complex dynamics of race, identity, and intergroup relations in the marketplace, and demonstrate a contemporary exception to ingroup favoritism among some White consumers.</content>

    <title>Understanding and Mitigating the Robot Disadvantage in Luxury Services: The Role of Desire for Superiority</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Shuang Ma, Lin Ge, Michael Jia, Yonggui WangIn recent years, the use of service robots in the lodging, dining, and retail sectors has become more prevalent. Service robots offer various benefits, such as reducing operational costs, improving service efficiency, enabling 24-hour support, and ensuring consistent service quality. However, our research indicates that service firms do not uniformly benefit from service robot deployment across all service settings. Specifically, we show that customers’ relative preference for service robots over human service providers is lower in luxury services than in mainstream services. We call it the robot disadvantage in luxury services. This disadvantage arises because service robots—as nonhuman service providers—cannot make customers feel that they are being served as a prestigious customer of superior social status over service providers. To address this challenge, we propose two effective strategies for luxury service firms. First, luxury service firms may emphasize the concept of social equality in their communications. Second, luxury service firms may frame the use of service robots as an exclusive privilege. Both approaches can mitigate customers’ resistance to robots in luxury services.</content>

    <title>The US, Economic News, and the Global Financial Cycle</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide evidence for a causal link between the US economy and the global financial cycle. Using intraday data, we show that US macroeconomic news releases have large and significant effects on global risky asset prices. Stock price indexes of 27 countries, the VIX, and commodity prices all jump instantaneously upon news releases. The responses of stock indexes co-move across countries and are large—often comparable in size to the response of the S&amp;P 500. Further, US macroeconomic news explains on average 23 percent of the quarterly variation in foreign stock markets. The joint behavior of stock prices, bond yields, and risk premia suggests that systematic US monetary policy reactions to news do not drive the estimated effects. Instead, the evidence points to a direct effect on investors’ risk-taking capacity. Our findings show that a byproduct of the United States’ central position in the global financial system is that news about its business cycle has large effects on global financial conditions.</content>
