    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine the optimal financing of infrastructure when governments can expropriate rents from private sector firms that manage infrastructure. While private firms need incentives to implement projects well, governments need incentives to limit expropriation. This double moral hazard limits the willingness of outside investors to fund infrastructure projects. Optimal financing contracts involve government guarantees to investors against project failure to incentivize the government to agree not to expropriate, thus improving private sector incentives and project quality. The contract also reflects several other features prevalent in infrastructure financing in practice, among which are government coinvestment, tax subsidies, and development rights.

    <title>How do corporate tax hikes affect investment allocation within multinationals?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies how corporate tax hikes transmit across countries through multinationals’ internal networks of subsidiaries. We build a parsimonious multicountry model to highlight two opposing spillover effects: while tax competition between countries generates positive investment spillover, intra-firm production linkages predict negative spillover. Using subsidiary-level data and exogenous corporate tax hikes, we find that local business units cut investment by 0.5% for a 1% increase in foreign corporate tax. This result highlights the importance of production linkages in propagating foreign tax shocks, as the supply-chain-induced negative spillover dominates the positive spillover effect suggested by the conventional wisdom of tax competition.</content>

    <title>Officer-Involved: The Media Language of Police Killings</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines language patterns in US television news coverage of police killings. We first document that the media use semantic structures—such as passive voice, nominalizations, and intransitive verbs—that obscure responsibility more often in cases of police killings than in cases of civilian killings. Through an online experiment, we demonstrate the significance of these semantic differences, revealing that participants are less likely to hold police officers morally responsible and demand penalties when exposed to obfuscatory language, particularly in cases involving unarmed victims. Further analysis of news data shows greater use of obfuscatory language when the victims are unarmed or video footage is available—situations where obfuscation may have the greatest impact. Exploring the causes of this differential obfuscation, we do not find evidence that it is driven by either demand-side factors or supply-side factors associated with TV station ownership and political leaning. Instead, our results suggest that narratives crafted by police departments are a more likely driver of media obfuscation. Our study underscores the importance of semantic structures in how media shape perceptions, extending beyond considerations of coverage volume and bias.</content>

    <title>The Impact of Being Denied a Wanted Abortion on Women and Their Children</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of denying a wanted abortion on women and children in Colombia using high-quality administrative microdata and credibly exogenous variation in abortion access. Women can seek legal abortions through a tutela, with cases randomly assigned to judges. Female judges are 20 p.p. (32%) less likely to deny abortion cases than male judges, and we use the judge’s sex as an instrument for abortion denial. Denial of a wanted abortion has both immediate and lasting effects. It increases a woman’s risk of death by 2.5 p.p within nine months, mainly due to unsafe abortion procedures, and raises the likelihood of carrying the pregnancy to term by 31 p.p. Tracking outcomes up to 15 years later, we find that women denied an abortion experience more health issues, lower educational attainment, reduced labor-force participation, and higher rates of single motherhood, poverty, and reliance on government assistance. Existing children, born before their mother sought an abortion, are less likely to attend school and more likely to work.</content>

    <title>Who Is AI Replacing? The Impact of Generative AI on Online Freelancing Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on the demand for online freelancers using a large data set from a leading global freelancing platform. We identify the types of jobs that are more affected by generative AI and quantify the magnitude of the heterogeneous impact. Our findings indicate a 21% decrease in the number of job posts for automation-prone jobs related to writing and coding compared with jobs requiring manual-intensive skills within eight months after the introduction of ChatGPT. We show that the reduction in the number of job posts increases competition among freelancers, whereas the remaining automation-prone jobs are of greater complexity and offer higher pay. We also find that the introduction of image-generating AI technologies led to a 17% decrease in the number of job posts related to image creation. We use Google Trends to show that the more pronounced decline in the demand for freelancers within automation-prone jobs correlates with their higher public awareness of ChatGPT’s substitutability.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05420 .</content>

    <title>Sharing the Fame but Taking the Blame: When Declaring a Single Person Responsible Solves a Free Rider Problem</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Teams are formed because input from different people is needed. Providing incentives to team members, however, can be difficult. According to received wisdom, declaring all members responsible fails because real responsibility for team output “diffuses.” But why? Also, why and when does formally declaring one member “responsible” mean that this member can be attributed real responsibility? We offer a model that answers these questions. We identify when jointly declaring a team responsible results in reputation free riding. We show that declaring one person responsible can overcome this problem but only if all other team members are protected from being sanctioned.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.</content>

    <title>The Race for Data: Utilizing Informative or Persuasive Cues to Gain Opt-In?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandates explicit user opt-in consent for data access. It recommends transparency in opt-in requests about data collection, storage, and use, without specifying the format of these requests. Consequently, the GDPR gives firms flexibility in designing opt-in messages. This research uses theory, multiple datasets, and methods to investigate firms’ communication formats for opt-in requests, addressing three questions: (1) How do firms design their opt-in requests? (2) Does the chosen format affect consumer response? (3) What drives firms’ choices of formats? The analysis of 1,506 repermission emails from 1,396 firms post-GDPR shows that 26% use only persuasive cues to request data, while 24% blend persuasive and informative cues. Notably, businesses with an offline presence use more persuasive cues compared with purely digital entities. A field experiment rationalizes this behavior showing that informative cues alone did not improve opt-in; a mix of persuasive and informative cues proved more successful. Additionally, firms dependent on personal data use persuasive cues more often than firms concerned with reputational risks of GDPR noncompliance. This study offers pivotal insights for regulators, firms, and consumers, revealing variations in how different firms acquire consent and the impact of their strategies on user behavior.</content>

    <title>Cyclical Change of Partnership Practices in Hybrid Settings</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice‐driven institutionalism (PDI) is a conceptual lens that explains how practices connect macro‐level phenomena with micro‐level behaviours. Effective practices matter in hybrid organisational settings, such as cross‐sector partnerships, where actors from diverse institutional backgrounds collaborate. Despite its potential, PDI has yet to fully explore the dynamics and interactions among practices, which are essential for understanding their collective and temporal impact in any hybrid setting. Our study addresses this gap through a qualitative multi‐case analysis of three cross‐sector partnerships tackling complex social and environmental challenges. We identify three interconnected sets of partnership practices that help actors navigate the complexities that occur when the logics of business, government, and civil society clash. We reveal a cyclical pattern where collaboration oscillates between motivation and fatigue, driven by these practices. We introduce a conceptual model that transcends the so far static and isolated view on practices, advancing the PDI lens beyond its current limitations. Furthermore, it illuminates the role of the individual in hybrid settings of collaboration.</content>

    <title>Reenvisioning Family-Supportive Organizations Through a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Perspective: A Review and Research Agenda</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The growing literature on family-supportive organizations (FSOs) examines work–family supports that organizations provide to employees—informal (e.g., perceptions of supervisor and coworker support, climate) and formal (e.g., policies, including those mandated in national contexts). Yet FSO research remains underintegrated with the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) literature, limiting understanding of how to enhance FSO-related effects. We draw on a DEI perspective to analyze the extent and quality to which core DEI-related constructs are integrated into FSO scholarship. Results from 192 reviewed studies show that diversity (39%) and equality (35%) are the most studied constructs, although there were limitations with their conceptualization by work–family researchers. Other constructs are frequently omitted from studies and, when included, are poorly applied. These include intersectionality (15%), which is often used with a lack of attention to intersecting and multilevel influences; equity (5%), which is confounded with equality; and inclusion (12.5%) and belonging (5%), which are vaguely operationalized. Our thematic review-driven insights emphasize how improved integration of DEI constructs into the FSO literature will drive research that (1) broadens the conceptualization of who needs family support to better reflect an increasingly diverse workforce with intersecting work and family identities; (2) gives greater attention to power, stigma, and marginalization in the context of work–family dynamics; and (3) unpacks causality involving multilevel relationships across DEI and FSO constructs and links these to work–family–supportive leadership. Future research is needed to ensure that all employees experience FSO that neither intentionally nor unintentionally privileges higher-power employee groups over others.</content>

    <title>The multinational enterprise, capabilities, and digitalization: governance and growth with world disorder</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This essay revisits my 2014 JIBS article about the potential for integrating international business internalization theory with a strategic management capabilities perspective. It recaps the capabilities framework with an emphasis on the learning required of emerging market multinationals and illustrates this with the case of Hyundai Motor Company’s internationalization and growth. It also discusses two aspects of the global economy that have become more prominent since 2014 in shaping international business: geopolitical uncertainty and digitalization. A rise in geopolitical tensions appears to be rebalancing the relationships between multinationals and home/host governments. Digitalization facilitates international business; but it adds new vulnerabilities by (further) accelerating competition, enabling new rivals, and introducing systemic risks into digital supply chains. Implications for managers, board members, and international business scholars are drawn.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the optimal design of stress scenarios. A principal manages the unknown risk exposures of agents by asking them to report losses under hypothetical scenarios before taking remedial actions. We apply a Kalman filter to solve the learning problem, and we relate the optimal design to the risk environment, the principal's preferences, and available interventions. In a banking context, optimal capital requirements cover losses under an adverse scenario, while targeted interventions depend on covariances among residual exposures and systematic risks. Our calibration reveals that information is particularly valuable for targeted interventions as opposed to broad capital requirements.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite its importance to the functioning of entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs), the orchestration of networks remains a largely undertheorized topic. To address this “omission,” we sought to explain the interplay between networks, their orchestrators, and their implications for ecosystem outcomes. To do so, we conducted an in-depth case study of the Agtech Valley EE in Brazil. From our study, we developed theoretical insights on the notion of “ecosystem coherence” as a foundational driver of EE structuration. Findings revealed two dimensions of ecosystem coherence: capabilities coherence (based on organizational and cognitive proximities) and relationship coherence (based on institutional and social proximities).</content>

    <title>Methodological Pluralism and Innovation in Data-Driven Organizations</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research on data-driven innovation, which assumes quantitative analysis as the default, suggests a tradeoff: Organizations that rely heavily on data-driven analysis tend to produce familiar, incremental innovations with moderate commercial potential, at the expense of risky, novel breakthroughs or hit products. We argue that this tradeoff does not hold when quantitative and qualitative analysis are used together. Organizations that substantially rely on both types of analysis in the new-product innovation process will benefit by triangulating quantifiably verifiable demand (which prompts more moderate successes but fewer hits) with qualitatively discernible potential (which prompts more novelty but more flops). Although relying primarily on either type of analysis has little impact on overall new-product sales due to the countervailing strengths and weaknesses inherent in each, together they have a complementary positive effect on new-product sales as each compensates for the weaknesses of the other. Drawing on a unique dataset of 3,768 new-product innovations from NielsenIQ linked to employee résumé job descriptions from 55 consumer-product firms, we find support for our hypothesis. The highest sales and number of hits were observed in organizations that demonstrated methodological pluralism: substantial reliance on both types of analyses. Further mixed-method research examining related outcomes—hits, flops, and novelty—corroborates our theory and confirms its underlying mechanisms.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper documents a striking fact: a narrow window around Fed meetings captures the entire secular decline in U.S. Treasury yields. Yield movements outside this window are transitory and wash out over time. This is surprising because the forces behind the secular decline are thought to be independent of monetary policy. Long-term bond yields decline when the Fed cuts the short rate and when the Fed lowers its long-run forecast of the federal funds rate (the “dot plot”). These results are consistent with the view that Fed announcements provide guidance about the long-run path of interest rates. (JEL E43, E52, G12, G14)</content>

    <title>To Ask or Not to Ask: The Effects of Broadly and Narrowly Adopted Peer-Recognition Systems on Help Seeking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many companies now use peer-recognition systems that allow employees to publicly recognize their peers for positive behaviors. Practitioners have touted the potential for these systems to increase helping among employees. However, the extent to which employees actually use these systems to recognize their peers varies across organizations; some are used broadly by many employees across all functional, specialty, geographic, and hierarchical subgroups of the organization, whereas others are only narrowly used by some, but not all, subgroups. Across three experiments, we examine how peer-recognition systems impact employees’ propensity to ask others for help (i.e., help seeking) based on whether the system is broadly used by all subgroups or only narrowly used by specific subgroups. We predict and find that a peer-recognition system broadly used by all subgroups strengthens employees’ perception of a help-seeking norm. This perception increases employees’ propensity to seek help directly through norm conformity and indirectly by reducing the perceived psychological costs of help seeking. We also predict and find that the effect of peer-recognition systems that are narrowly used by specific subgroups is moderated by whether employees belong to the subgroups using the system; whereas it increases help-seeking propensity for members of the subgroups using the system, it decreases help-seeking propensity for nonmembers relative to when there is no peer-recognition system. Our theory and results suggest that peer-recognition systems can increase help seeking, but these same systems could decrease help seeking for employees belonging to subgroups that do not use the system.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: Supported by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Indiana University.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00318 .</content>

    <title>The Value of Specific Knowledge: Evidence from Disruptions to the Patient–Physician Relationship</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When a member of a work team leaves, some knowledge is lost to the organization. Exploiting quasi-random turnover among military physicians because of deployments, I estimate the effects of turnover on patients and other providers in the same care team. I find that a discontinuity in primary care leads to a 3%–5% increase in costs driven primarily by an increase in the use and intensity of specialty care with no observable benefit to the patient as measured by potential reductions in hospitalization rates and emergency department usage. This indicates that the full cost of turnover includes a reduction in access to knowledge among remaining members of the team.This paper was accepted by Carri Chan, healthcare management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03884 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Newly released music is never assessed in isolation by audiences, who tend to compare objective (sonic attributes) and subjective (genre affiliations) elements of its identity with the previous musical catalog of the corresponding artist, his or her musically proximal peers, and the most successful releases in the market. In this paper, we provide a general framework that disentangles the objective and subjective identities of new musical releases and evaluates how differentiation affects audience reactions. We posit that radio stations, who seek commercial success, have different preferences toward differentiation in comparison with critics, who grant cultural legitimacy in the industry. Combining play numbers, reviews, and music description data from different sources, we find that radio stations prefer consistency in the musical style of successive releases by the focal artist and especially favor albums that sound similar to chart toppers. Critics, however, exhibit opposite preferences, preferring novelty compared with past works of the artist, while remaining uninfluenced by contemporaneous music dynamics. Our moderation checks reveal that decisions around genre affiliations and scheduling of new releases aid music producers to effectively manage audience expectations. This suggests that data-driven decision support systems can help artists to strategically release new products that cater to heterogeneous tastes.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, entrepreneurship and innovation.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03319 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate whether firm-level political connections affect the allocation of exemptions from tariffs imposed on $US 550 billion of Chinese goods imported to the United States annually beginning in 2018. Evidence points to politicians not only rewarding supporters but also punishing opponents: Past campaign contributions to the party controlling (in opposition to) the executive branch increase (decrease) approval likelihood. Our findings point to quid pro quo arrangements between politicians and firms, as opposed to the “information” channel linking political access to regulatory outcomes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Framing is critical for leaders who must build support for strategic renewal. While research has concentrated on renewal that replaces one set of capabilities with another, we explore a distinctive challenge: how leaders persuade stakeholders to endorse the reprioritization of resources toward a capability set that must coexist with an existing one. Moreover, while research has focused on how leaders build employee support for renewal, we examine how to persuade those overseeing resource allocation. Our study analyzes Director Robert Mueller's 12‐year effort at the FBI—after the 9/11 terrorist attacks—to build up counterterrorism capabilities while maintaining existing law enforcement capabilities. We offer a novel distinction between outcome frames and process frames and discuss how each frame, sequenced properly, is relevant to strategic renewal.Managerial SummaryThis study examines how leaders can build support for strategic renewal when an organization must develop new capabilities while maintaining existing ones. We analyze how FBI Director Robert Mueller, in the wake of 9/11, used strategic communication—or framing—to persuade members of Congress overseeing the FBI's budget to support the development of new counterterrorism capabilities alongside its traditional law enforcement mandate. We highlight two types of frames: outcome frames (focused on what the organization seeks to achieve) and process frames (emphasizing how the organization operates). Our findings reveal that sequencing these types of frames is essential. By using outcome frames to address immediate concerns and shifting to process frames to resolve longer‐term tensions, leaders can build stakeholder support for complex resource reprioritization efforts.</content>

    <title>Repositioning, audience churn, and identity ambiguity: The external costs of market repositioning</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior literature has long underscored the importance for market actors to establish clear identities. Extant studies mostly adopt a static view, assessing whether actors adhere to a specific prototype or membership. By stressing a dynamic perspective, we maintain that identities are in flux as actors constantly shift positions. Specifically, we emphasize that repositioning can induce identity ambiguity, undermining the accuracy of audience evaluation. Analyzing market repositioning of US firms, we find that firms with greater repositioning tend to experience a higher degree of churn in their coverage audiences (financial analysts). More importantly, audiences are found to be less accurate in evaluating firms that undertake greater repositioning. These results align with our conjecture about external repositioning costs: Firms risk incurring identity ambiguity when shifting market positions.Managerial SummaryFirms constantly reposition in the market via adjusting their product portfolios. We maintain that firms with greater repositioning are subject to considerable external costs, because repositioning can breed ambiguity about their market identities. By analyzing product market positioning and repositioning of US public firms, we find that firms' repositioning often leads to an increased turnover of analysts covering them and undermines the accuracy of analysts' forecasts on their earnings. Our extensions also indicate that firms' repositioning efforts may be less ambiguous, when their initial position is more conventional in the product space and/or when analysts have developed greater firm‐specific experiences. Together, the findings underscore the importance for firms to consider external costs in their repositioning processes.</content>

    <title>Melons as Lemons: Asymmetric Information, Consumer Learning and Seller Reputation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Quality provision is often low in many developing markets, and firms commonly lack a reputation for quality. This paper examines this issue both theoretically and empirically in the context of retail watermelon markets in China. I first demonstrate the existence of significant asymmetric information on quality between sellers and buyers, as well as the absence of a quality premium at baseline. To explain this, I develop a theoretical model that highlights the role of consumer beliefs and costly signaling in influencing sellers’ reputation incentives. I then conduct an experiment by randomly introducing two signaling technologies into different markets: a cheap sticker label and a more expensive laser-cut label. Consistent with the theoretical predictions, the laser label induces sellers to offer higher quality, resulting in increased sales and profits, while the sticker label fails to achieve the same effect. Using the experimental variation, I estimate an empirical model of consumer learning to uncover the underlying evolution of beliefs. The results show that pessimistic beliefs under the sticker label can hinder reputation building, whereas the laser label enhances consumer learning and strengthens sellers’ reputation incentives.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the problem of sharing the revenues raised from subscriptions to music streaming platforms among content providers. We provide direct, axiomatic, and game-theoretical foundations for two focal (and somewhat polar) methods widely used in practice: pro rata and user centric. The former rewards artists proportionally to their number of total streams. With the latter, each user’s subscription fee is proportionally divided among the artists streamed by that user. We also provide foundations for two families of methods addressing the rising concern in the music industry to explore new streaming models that better align the interests of artists, fans, and streaming services. One of the families offers a natural compromise between the pro rata and user-centric methods. The other family generalizes the user-centric method while capturing various formalizations of incentives for artists and users.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: This work was supported by Xunta de Galicia [Grant ED431B2022/03] and MCIU/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and FSE+ [Grants PID2020-113440GBI00, PID2020-115011GB-I00, and PID2023-146364NB-I00].</content>

    <title>Pricing Durable Add-Ons: Selling vs. Leasing</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many firms offer products that consist of a durable base good (e.g., a vehicle) and a durable add-on (e.g., autopilot software). Some lease the add-on, whereas others sell it through intertemporal price discrimination or bundled pricing. Motivated by these practices, we examine whether a monopolistic firm should lease or sell the add-on when offering both durables. The literature suggests that leasing is preferable for a single durable good as it avoids the time inconsistency problem associated with selling. However, because leasing lacks an intertemporal link, it is less efficient than selling in balancing surplus extraction across consumers, leading to what we call the intraperiod imbalance problem. When the firm sells the base good, this can resolve the time inconsistency of add-on selling but perpetuate the intraperiod imbalance of add-on leasing. Thus, selling the add-on can be more profitable than leasing it. When the firm can choose between selling or leasing the base good, selling both the base good and the add-on can be more profitable than leasing both.This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.Funding: P.

    <title>When Diversity Backfires: The Asymmetric Role of Multicultural Diversity on Brand Perception</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Brands are expanding their market to new consumers by displaying cultural diversity in marketing campaigns—but the risks are unclear. This article explores the role of the brand’s characteristics in multicultural diversity. Our findings suggest that when brands launch a new multicultural diversity campaign, it may be well-received if the brand’s original focus was on the needs of nonmarginalized consumers. However, for brands with a focus on the needs of marginalized consumers (i.e., marginalized-focused brands), such a campaign may be perceived as selling out, thereby negatively impacting consumers’ reactions. Six studies with Black and White U.S. consumers explore this novel “sellout effect” across various product categories and for consequential behaviors. Inclusion is identified as a key mechanism, mitigation strategies are explored, and implications for theory and practice are discussed. Findings highlight the importance of diversity marketing, understanding marginalization for consumers and brands, and the need for research that considers race and ethnicity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Drawing on goal-setting and stewardship theories, this study examines the management of family and business goals in family firms under transgenerational complexity, presenting a dynamic model of family stewardship. Through multiple case studies, we identify four distinct stewardship strategies, each with a corresponding governance structure: cultivating family stewardship (with family-dense governance), professionalizing family stewardship (with professionalized governance), harnessing external stewardship (with externally dense governance), and perpetuating external stewardship (with public companies’ governance). These strategies shift from family-centric to business-centric goal-setting approaches in sustaining the family firm. The study introduces stewardship transition capability as a missing cog for managing these transitions.</content>

    <title>First-Stage Sampling in Ranking and Selection: Beyond Variance Estimation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study sheds light on a crucial aspect of ranking-and-selection (R&amp;S) procedures—how the first-stage sample size, [Formula: see text], impacts the procedure efficiency beyond the variance estimation. This research demonstrates that the presence of [Formula: see text] helps reduce the probability of incorrect selection (PICS). However, this issue of [Formula: see text] has been traditionally ignored, thereby leading to unnecessarily conservativeness of existing R&amp;S procedures. To address this issue, the authors provide exact formulas for both indifference-zone (IZ) and IZ-free procedures, highlighting how [Formula: see text] influences PICS under worst-case configurations. Based on these formulas, this research further offers new guidelines on the choice of [Formula: see text] for the existing procedures and introduces an improved version of the classic IZ-free procedure. This research provides important insights for further enhancing the efficiency of R&amp;S in various potential applications.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Exploitation of consumer data allows online retailers to enhance services provided to consumers but at the risk of causing unintended privacy issues. There has been debate about whether to devise regulation policies to restrict data collection and usage by online retailers. This paper studies the implications of newly adopted privacy policies, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for an online retail supply chain comprising a retailer and a supplier. We find that despite the GDPR’s intention to safeguard consumer privacy, it may inadvertently hurt consumer surplus while benefiting the retailer. In fact, the GDPR may lead to an outcome detrimental to all parties involved, including the retailer, supplier, and consumers, thereby resulting in a triple-lose situation. Our results hold significant implications for consumers, supply chain firms, and policymakers alike, contributing to the existing literature on evaluating the impact of privacy regulations on technology innovation and adoption.This paper was accepted by Karan Girotra, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01819 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide evidence that losses constrain short sellers but not the transmission of information to prices. Using unique data on U.S. equity lending, we document a negative impact of the mark-to-market losses of a stock’s short sellers, but no impact of their gains, on the future shorting of the stock. Consistent with funding and institutional constraints limiting short selling, we further show that the effect is highly asymmetric across different loss levels and stronger among stocks facing higher margin requirements. However, loss-making short selling has no impact on price efficiency or predictive power for returns, suggesting that these constraints affect mostly uninformed shorting activity.This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the University of Melbourne [Faculty Research Grant].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01356 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Non‐profits face rising pressure to secure funding and innovate for increasingly complex social problems, while cognizant that failed innovations could produce consequential societal harm. In a longitudinal case study, we apply a social innovation lens to examine how a non‐profit experiments with hybridity. Applying such a lens foregrounds mechanisms of social value creation, capture and distribution and reveals how non‐profits can move beyond managing tensions and instead look to reframe hybridity as innovation. Our study, based as it is in social innovation, brings a focus to organizational dynamics and processes and reveals how organizational responses to hybridity occur in mission and operations and, importantly, in strategy. This reconceptualization of hybridity makes a theoretical contribution in bridging literature on hybridity and social innovation, anchoring in management and strategy. It also makes a significant empirical contribution in reconceptualizing hybridity for practitioners and in showing how hybridity may then be viewed not as a threat to non‐profit values and traditions and not as an ongoing tension to resolve, but rather as a process to innovate and amplify social value and impact.</content>

    <title>Alignment in Mature Ecosystems: An Iterative Process Of Interorganizational Influence</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Extant empirical research on ecosystem alignment has offered little insight into how mature ecosystems align their members with a new value proposition. Our longitudinal empirical study of a seven-year hub-driven alignment initiative within the SOK led retail ecosystem in Finland explores how a mature ecosystem hub attempted to enroll its members in a value-proposition updating, ecosystem-wide initiative and the members’ reaction. We find that the mature ecosystem alignment process unfolds through four distinct sets of practices: (1) Courtship, (2) Mutual Adaptation, (3) Peer Emulation, and (4) Coercion. We describe these practices and associated mechanisms and develop a process model indicating how they unfold and interrelate. Our study provides a nuanced, empirically grounded account of mature ecosystem alignment as an iterative process of multilateral interorganizational influence that leads to, on the one hand, a convergence of actions among an expanding set of ecosystem members and, on the other hand, a divergence of views between the newly aligned members and a subset of members who become increasingly entrenched in their perception of irreconcilable differences and ultimately leave the ecosystem. Our discussion suggests that the tension between the hub’s temptation to control and the ecosystem members’ concern about preserving their autonomy propels the alignment process to its conclusion. We conclude with methodological contributions, managerial implications and avenues for future research.</content>

    <title>An Identity Threat Appraisal Framework Explaining Distinct Reactions to Active- and Passive-Aggressive Abusive Supervision</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Previous research has predominantly focused on the overt acts of supervisory abuse or has taken a general approach that fails to differentiate between its distinctive forms. Integrating the literature on hot versus cold identity threats and identity threat appraisal, we examine how different forms of abusive supervision influence employee outcomes. We argue that active-aggressive abusive supervision, characterized by supervisors’ overt acts of abuse, embodies a hot identity threat that stimulates employees’ identity-protection responses, such as supervisor-directed aggression, a form of derogation. By contrast, passive-aggressive abusive supervision, involving covert acts of abuse, represents a cold identity threat that triggers employees’ identity-restructuring responses, manifesting as feedback seeking directed at coworkers and work withdrawal. These two pathways operate through distinct mechanisms—decreased group self-esteem and increased self-uncertainty, respectively—and are influenced by different moderators. The results from two experiments and one field study largely supported the hypothesized relationships. By differentiating between two forms of abusive supervision and examining their distinct effects, this study enhances our understanding of the nuanced nature of abusive supervision, its impacts, underlying mechanisms, and contingencies.</content>

    <title>Institutions and the real effects of private equity buyouts: A meta‐analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study reviews four decades of fragmented and contradictory empirical literature on the real effects of private equity (PE) buyouts on portfolio companies, differentiating between efficiency and growth outcomes. We hypothesize how institutional forces, including regulatory, cognitive, and normative institutions explain heterogeneity in post‐buyout efficiency and growth across time and countries. We argue that competition and population‐level learning have shifted the cognitive frame underlying value creation in buyouts from financial engineering toward operational engineering and strategic entrepreneurship. Using meta‐analysis, we find support for several of our hypotheses using samples from 66 empirical studies across the finance, management, economics, and entrepreneurship disciplines.Managerial SummaryThis study delves into four decades of fragmented private equity (PE) literature to unravel the practical implications for post‐buyout efficiency and growth. Using meta‐analysis, we explore the role of institutional forces—regulatory, cognitive, and normative—in shaping outcomes across diverse temporal and geographical contexts. We observe an overall paradigm shift in PE value creation over time, transitioning from focusing on financial engineering to operational value creation and strategic entrepreneurship. This transformation is driven by heightened competition and widespread population‐level learning. Validating our hypotheses through a thorough examination of 66 empirical studies spanning finance, management, economics, and entrepreneurship disciplines, our findings offer insights for policymakers and practitioners navigating the nuanced landscape of PE buyouts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is causal evidence that mortgage credit expansions increase house prices. Does an expansion of margin lending increase stock prices? Because unconstrained arbitrageurs are more important for pricing stocks than homes, the impact is not obvious. Tests are limited because sizable shocks to margin lending are rare. We examine a major Chinese margin-lending expansion between 2010 and 2015. Institutional holding, regression discontinuity, and event study evidence—exploiting the rollout of margin lending across stocks—shows that arbitrageurs anticipated and bought in advance of a significant causal effect of credit. We develop a model to rationalize our findings. Our estimates suggest that margin debt contributes to stock market fluctuations. (JEL G01, G11, G12, G18)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the United States, a significant number of criminal defendants are held in pretrial detention and face substantial financial burdens. Matching individual-level criminal case records to household-level financial data, we exploit the quasi-random assignment of court commissioners to study how pretrial detention affects household solvency. We find that pretrial detention results in higher rates of household insolvency, driven by higher rates of chapter 7 bankruptcies and judgment liens, and higher foreclosure rates during periods of decreasing house prices. We document that the effects spill over to family members and show that home equity can cushion households from insolvency. (JEL D14, G51, K41, K42)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study introduces a novel mood metric—blockbuster movie releases—and investigates its correlation with stock market dynamics. We document a significant positive correlation between blockbuster movie releases and U.S. stock market returns in the subsequent week. This pattern remains robust across various robustness tests both in-sample and out-of-sample. The changes in weekly box office revenue and increased Internet searches for movie-related terms further affirm this relationship. Moreover, releases of blockbuster movies predict lower expected market volatility and risk aversion. The positive predictive effect on market returns is also evident in international markets.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates how a manufacturer’s internal sourcing capability and government regulation influence the supplier’s distribution strategy and the manufacturer’s sourcing and capability investment decisions. We consider a supply chain consisting of a supplier that produces a critical component, an independent manufacturer that also has the capability to produce the component in-house, and a dependent manufacturer without such capability. We first consider a scenario in which the supplier chooses its distribution strategy—either offering its component to both manufacturers or establishing an exclusive selling agreement with a single manufacturer. We explore how the supplier’s optimal distribution strategy (dual or exclusive selling) depends on the terms and process of the contract and on the independent manufacturer’s ability to produce a high-quality component in-house. We also show that, in equilibrium, the independent manufacturer may invest in a high capability level (leading to a high-quality component) as a strategic deterrent against the supplier’s decision to engage in an exclusive selling agreement with the dependent manufacturer. We further consider a setting with mandatory exclusion, imposed by government regulation, that affects free trade among parties. We show that mandatory exclusion can exacerbate or mitigate the independent manufacturer’s incentive to invest in internal sourcing capability, relative to a setting in which the supplier determines its distribution strategy in the absence of such government regulations. Moreover, we show that mandatory exclusion always hurts the supplier, but it can benefit or hurt the manufacturers as well as the consumers, depending on the independent manufacturer’s investment cost and the conditions leading to an exclusionary contract under free trade.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We investigate the design of a waiting area of a service system where different types of customers seek different services, provided by designated servers. We examine two waiting room designs: the designated waiting room, where each server has its own designated waiting area, and the shared waiting room, where all customers are waiting together. In the designated waiting room design, customers observe the number of customers waiting for each service, whereas in the shared waiting room, customers cannot distinguish which service the other customers are waiting for, but can still observe the total number of customers in the waiting room and make a joining/balking decision accordingly. Assuming two types of customers that have similar characteristics seeking service from two different servers, we show that all customers adopt an identical pure equilibrium threshold. We find the shared waiting room design achieves higher throughput than the designated waiting room design when the congestion rate is low. However, the designated waiting room is always preferable in terms of social welfare. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the asymmetric case, where types differ from each other in terms of arrival rate, service reward, per unit-time waiting cost, and service duration. Finding the equilibrium strategies in these cases is more challenging and requires an iterative process.We show that mixed equilibrium thresholds can emerge, and that the designated waiting room does not always improve system performance, even when considering social welfare.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Are Firms Voluntarily Disclosing Emissions Greener?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do firms voluntarily disclosing emissions have lower levels of greenhouse gases in their in-house and outsourced operations? We examine this question using Scope 1 and upstream Scope 3 emission data reported by firms or estimated by S&amp;P Trucost from 2002 to 2020. Our empirical results reveal that “voluntary disclosing firms” tend to have lower levels of “internal emissions” (i.e., Scope 1 emissions) and yet higher levels of “external emissions” from upstream suppliers (i.e., estimated upstream Scope 3 emissions). Overall, disclosing firms tend to have more emissions in the entire supply chain. A plausible explanation is that they may outsource more emissions to upstream suppliers than non-disclosing firms. By exploring the potential mechanisms that explain our results, we find that disclosing firms tend to exert more effort to reduce their internal emissions and outsource more carbon-intensive operations to suppliers. This finding is consistent with their decreasing Scope 1 emissions and increasing Scope 3 emissions. In addition to examining differences in emissions between high- and low-emission industries and across regions, we also investigate the implications of mandatory environmental reporting regulations by different governments and find these regulations can effectively nudge disclosing firms to reduce total emissions, including Scope 1 and Scope 3. As more regulations require the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions, our findings highlight the necessity for firms to develop processes and exert efforts to measure, monitor, and control both in-house and outsourced emissions. Additionally, our findings indicate that ESG investment managers should perform due diligence rather than solely relying on firms that disclose their Scope 1 emissions.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Toward a Fairness-Aware Scoring System for Algorithmic Decision-Making</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scoring systems, as a type of predictive model, have significant advantages in interpretability and transparency and facilitate quick decision-making. As such, scoring systems have been extensively used in a wide variety of industries, such as healthcare and criminal justice. However, the fairness issues in these models have long been criticized, and the use of big data and ML algorithms in the construction of scoring systems heightens this concern. This paper proposes a general framework to create fairness-aware, data-driven scoring systems. First, we develop a social welfare function that incorporates both efficiency and group fairness. Then, we transform the social welfare maximization problem into the risk minimization task in machine learning, and derive a fairness-aware scoring system with the help of mixed integer programming. Lastly, several theoretical bounds are derived for providing parameter selection suggestions. Our proposed framework provides a suitable solution to address group fairness concerns in developing scoring systems. It enables policymakers to set and customize their desired fairness requirements as well as other application-specific constraints. We test the proposed algorithm with several empirical data sets. Experimental evidence supports the effectiveness of the proposed scoring system in achieving the optimal welfare of stakeholders and in balancing the needs for interpretability, fairness, and efficiency.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the paper “Multistage Robust Mixed-Integer Programming,” Krzysztof Postek, Ward Romeijnders, and Wolfram Wiesemann study multistage robust mixed-integer programming problems, a popular and powerful yet computationally demanding framework for decision making under uncertainty. The authors leverage dynamic programming principles to decompose multistage problems into large numbers of two-stage subproblems, and they use the finite adaptability approach to solve the latter to exact or approximate optimality. The resulting method allows for efficient parallelization, and the authors showcase its effectiveness on route planning and location-transportation problems.</content>

    <title>Gender Differences in High-Stakes Performance and College Admission Policies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Gale-Shapley algorithm is one of the most popular college allocation mechanisms around the world. A crucial policy question in its setting is designing admission priorities for students, understanding how they disadvantage certain demographic groups, and whether these differences relate to differences in college performance potential. Studying a policy change in Spain, we find a negative effect of increasing the weight of standardized high-stakes exams on female college admission grades, driven by students expected to be at the top. The impact on admission grades does not affect enrollment, but the percentage of female students in the most selective degrees declines, along with their career prospects. Using data on the college performance of prereform cohorts, we find that female students most likely to lose from the reform tend to do better in college than male students expected to benefit from the reform. The results show that rewarding high-stakes performance in selection processes may come along with gender differences unrelated to the determinants of subsequent performance.This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kubler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: A.

    <title>Market Ambiguity Attitude Restores the Risk-Return Trade-Off</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A positive relation between the conditional mean and conditional volatility of aggregate stock returns, although viewed as a fundamental law of finance, has been challenging to find empirically. We consider a representative agent asset pricing model with Knightian uncertainty and demonstrate that this risk-return trade-off depends on the agent’s ambiguity attitude (reflecting the agent’s degree of optimism or pessimism). The model predicts that the conditional equity premium is increasing in market volatility, but its slope flattens as market optimism rises. We develop a methodology to extract the representative agent’s ambiguity attitude from our asset pricing model. Results validate our model predictions. We document the significant in-sample and out-of-sample explanatory power of ambiguity attitude in explaining the risk-return trade-off. In our sample, market volatility is not significant in forecasting returns. However, including the market ambiguity attitude leads to a significant positive relationship between volatility and future returns. Hence, our model and results identify market ambiguity attitude as a missing state variable that can explain why the literature has found it difficult to empirically validate the risk-return trade-off.This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03595 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study short-term and medium-term changes in bank risk-taking as a result of supervision and the associated real effects. For identification, we exploit the European Central Bank’s asset-quality-review (AQR) in conjunction with security and credit registers. After the AQR announcement, reviewed banks reduce riskier securities and credit supply, with the greatest effect on riskiest securities. We find negative spillovers on asset prices and firm-level credit availability. Moreover, nonbanks with higher exposure to reviewed banks acquire the shed risk. After the AQR compliance, reviewed banks reload riskier securities but not riskier credit, resulting in negative medium-term firm-level real effects. These effects are especially strong for firms with high ex ante credit risk. Among these nonsafe firms, even those with high ex ante productivity, experience negative real effects. Our findings suggest that banks’ liquid assets help them to mask risk from supervisors and risk adjustments banks make in response to supervision have persistent corporate real effects.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Funding: J.-L.

    <title>Addressing Endogeneity Using a Two-Stage Copula Generated Regressor Approach</title>
    <updated>2025-01-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The ubiquitous presence of endogenous regressors presents a significant challenge when drawing causal inferences using observational data. The classical econometric method used to handle regressor endogeneity requires instrumental variables (IVs) that must satisfy the stringent condition of exclusion restriction, rendering it unfeasible in many settings. Herein, the authors propose a new IV-free method that uses copulas to address the endogeneity problem. Existing copula correction methods require nonnormal endogenous regressors: Normally or nearly normally distributed endogenous regressors cause model nonidentification or significant finite-sample bias. Furthermore, existing copula control function methods presume the independence of exogenous regressors and endogenous regressors. The authors’ generalized two-stage copula endogeneity-correction (2sCOPE) method simultaneously relaxes the two key identification requirements while maintaining the Gaussian copula regressor–error dependence structure. They prove that under the Gaussian copula dependence structure, 2sCOPE yields consistent causal-effect estimates with correlated endogenous and exogenous regressors as well as normally distributed endogenous regressors. In addition to relaxing the identification requirements, 2sCOPE has superior finite-sample performance and addresses the significant finite-sample bias problem due to insufficient regressor nonnormality. Moreover, 2sCOPE employs generated regressors derived from existing regressors to control for endogeneity, and can thus considerably increase the ease and broaden the applicability of IV-free methods for handling regressor endogeneity. The authors further demonstrate 2sCOPE's performance using simulation studies and illustrate its use in an empirical application.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Cross-Channel Effects of Failure in a Retailer’s Mobile App</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Failures in omnichannel retailers’ mobile apps can significantly impact shoppers’purchases, extending beyond in-app to affect in-store transactions. Investigating such effects poses challenges because field experiments inducing app failures are infeasible, and non-experimental observational data typically suffer from selection biases. We leverage a natural experiment involving an exogenous failure in a large omnichannel retailer’s app that made the app unavailable during the failure period. We examine the impact of the app failure on purchases in both online (website, mobile app) and offline (store) channels using a difference-in-differences approach. Our findings show a substantial adverse effect of the app failure on shoppers’ frequency, quantity, and monetary value of purchases, leading to short-term revenue losses of up to $1.08 million, with an additional $1.89 million in potential long-term revenue erosion due to customer attrition over time. The effects are heterogeneous across channels and shoppers. The decline in purchases across channels primarily stems from reduced purchases in stores rather than the online channel. The decline in store purchases is predominantly explained by the search discontinuation mechanism, wherein shoppers who use the app primarily for search but complete their purchases in stores are unable to use the app for search and curtail their offline purchases following the app failure. The effect on purchases in the retailer’s online channel is insignificant, aligning with the channel switching mechanism, wherein shoppers who use the app primarily to purchase simply pivot their purchases to another online channel such as the website. Furthermore, shoppers with a lower monetary value of past purchases and more recent purchases are more sensitive to an app failure than others.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Can Marketing Enable Firms to Counter Import Competition? Evidence from the China Shock</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Increasingly, United States (US) firms have been threatened by import competition. For example, Chinese imports to the US increased from USD 18.97 billion in 1991 to USD 536.26 billion in 2022. Yet little research has examined the role of marketing in combating import competition. Addressing this gap, the author combines developments in the upper echelons, dynamic capabilities, and resource-based view perspectives to develop hypotheses of how marketing can help incumbent firms overcome import competition. To achieve identification, the author exploits the exogenous shock of conferral of Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status to China that differentially exposed US industries to import competition. The hypotheses are tested using a differences-in-differences estimation on 7,197 firm-year observations. The findings indicate that import competition hurts incumbent firms’ revenue growth. However, incumbent firms’ marketing department power and market-based assets (strategic differentiation and customer relationship capital) mitigate the adverse effects of import competition on revenue growth. The findings, which highlight the hitherto overlooked role of marketing in countering import competition, extend theory and generate practical implications.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research introduces a novel conceptualization of immersive service, defined as service that consumers are embedded in and surrounded by, in the sense that their life experience is within the service and, in great part, constructed by it for some period of time (e.g., hospital stays, residential care, air travel). The authors examine two key questions: How can characteristics of immersive service challenge consumer agency? How do consumers bolster their agency in immersive service? They study these questions through a novel theoretical lens (Figured Worlds Theory) and based on an ethnography in a residential care facility. The analyses unearth, define, and describe four conceptually novel characteristics of immersive service: encapsulation, positionality, multivocality and protocolization. These characteristics are crucial for marketers because, as the authors find, these structural aspects of immersive service can threaten consumer agency. The research also shows how consumers overcome challenges to agency. Specifically, consumers pursue five pathways toward their individual and collective agency: expanding the figured world, voicing, seeking task responsibility, challenging figured world protocols, and playing and imagining within the figured world. These findings break new conceptual ground for scholars, while also being relevant for managers, consistent with ideals of ‘Better Marketing for a Better World’.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Green innovation is an organizational strategy aimed to address climate crises and create low-carbon growth, yet, its implementation remains a significant challenge. We focus on green innovation implementation (GII) and argue that GII is a distinctive strategic process. Traditional innovation implementation, centered on short-term economic growth, can be problematic as it often decouples nature from innovation in the pursuit of profit maximization. Thus, the traditional approach fails to adequately explain GII, specifically, who implements it and how they do it. We adopt a strategy-as-practice perspective and conduct a systematic review of 224 journal articles across various management fields to synthesize existing knowledge of GII. This review makes three main contributions. First, we posit that GII is theoretically distinct with unique implementation challenges: recoupling nature with innovation implementation introduces complex antecedents and environment-inclusive benefits, requiring a long-term implementation process and a broader scope. Second, we develop a framework that synthesizes practitioners, antecedents, processes, and impact of GII from three theoretical foci: (1) resource-based perspective, (2) sustainable value-driven perspective, and (3) institutional perspective. This framework complements the traditional understanding of innovation implementation by offering diverse theoretical insights on GII. Third, we propose theoretical and methodological directions for future research to advance knowledge on green innovation and provide meaningful insights on GII.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We identify a new mechanism of opportunistic insider trading linked to attention-driven mispricing. Insiders are more likely to sell their company’s stock during periods of heightened retail attention and more inclined to buy when attention diminishes. The results are particularly pronounced for lottery-type stocks and firms with substantial retail ownership. We demonstrate that our findings—which relate to indicators of mispricing, retail order imbalances, and Robinhood herding episodes—extend to seasoned equity issuances and cannot be solely explained by firm fundamentals. Attention-based insider trading is less likely to result in SEC enforcement actions and persists across different regulatory regimes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document spillover effects of government policies promoting capital investment on household financial choices and wealth accumulation. Using individual-level data on employment outcomes and household balance sheets, we find that increase in accelerated depreciation limits increases the layoff probability of routine workers and reduces their stock share of liquid wealth relative to non-routine workers. Background risk due to the policy is mitigated when workers have access to generous unemployment insurance benefits. Finally, we show that such portfolio rebalancing adversely impacts investment returns and the wealth accumulation of routine workers.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using administrative data for 63,000 individuals across 2,500,000 person‐month observations, we find that wealthier individuals have better life insurance coverage, controlling for the value of the asset insured, namely, the consumption needs of dependents. This positive wealth‐insurance correlation, which is surprising given the prevailing view that wealth substitutes for insurance, persists after allowing for wealth‐related differences in risk or bequest preferences, pricing, background risk, education, employment, or liquidity constraints. Our findings call for further investigation of this wealth‐coverage correlation but support theories emphasizing the consumption‐smoothing role of insurance across not only states of the world, but also time.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The voluntary departure of hard‐to‐replace skilled workers worsens firm prospects, which can lead to additional departures. We develop a model in which firms design compensation to limit the risk of such “worker runs.” To achieve cost‐efficient retention, firms combine fixed wages with dilutable compensation—such as vesting equity or bonus pools—which pays remaining workers more when others leave but gets diluted otherwise. Compensating (identical) workers with differently structured compensation, that is, with a different mix of output‐dependent and output‐independent pay, can further mitigate the risk of worker runs by ensuring a critical retention level in a cost‐efficient way.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Regulatory fragmentation occurs when multiple federal agencies oversee a single issue. Using the full text of the Federal Register, the government's official daily publication, we provide the first systematic evidence on the extent and costs of regulatory fragmentation. Fragmentation increases the firm's costs while lowering its productivity, profitability, and growth. Moreover, it deters entry into an industry and increases the propensity of small firms to exit. These effects arise from redundancy and, more prominently, from inconsistencies between government agencies. Our results uncover a new source of regulatory burden, and we show that agency costs among regulators contribute to this burden.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We model the optimal resolution of insolvent firms in general equilibrium. Collateral‐constrained banks lend to (i) solvent firms to finance investments and (ii) distressed firms to avoid liquidation. Liquidations create negative fire‐sale externalities. Liquidations also relieve bank balance–sheet congestion, enabling new firm loans that generate positive collateral externalities by lowering bank borrowing rates. Socially optimal interventions encourage liquidation when firms have high operating losses, high leverage, or low productivity. Surprisingly, larger fire sales promote interventions encouraging more liquidations. We study synergies between insolvency interventions and macroprudential regulation, bailouts, deferred loss recognition, and debt subordination. Our model elucidates historical crisis interventions.</content>

    <title>Mythologized Counter-Futures and Self-Protective Consumption: A Netnography of Doomsday Preppers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite recognizing several ways consumers respond to perceived systemic risk scenarios, prior research emphasizes a general trend toward the privatization of risk, in which individual consumers are responsibilized for managing systemic risk scenarios through their consumption. However, prior work in this area blurs the distinction between responsibilized consumption aimed at self-protection versus preventing or reducing the likelihood of risk scenarios. Moreover, it does not explain how many consumers come to prioritize the former over the latter. To explore how this occurs, this netnography investigates doomsday preppers, consumers preparing for perceived catastrophic and systemic risk scenarios by stockpiling consumer goods, acquiring prosumptive knowledge, and cultivating survival skills. Drawing from the marketplace myths literature, this article introduces the concept of mythologized counter-futures to illustrate how preppers mobilize marketplace myths to socially construct future risk scenarios. Through mythic prefiguration, many preppers’ mythologized counter-futures ameliorate anxiety associated with vulnerability-inducing systemic risk scenarios and pattern anticipatory consumption toward self-protective consumption rather than risk-scenario preventive consumption. The analysis makes novel contributions to the literature on the social construction of risk, consumer responsibilization, consumer vulnerability, consumer timework, and marketplace myths.</content>

    <title>What Do You Do Outside of Work? When and Why Disclosing Eudaimonic Leisure Activities Increases Competence Perceptions and Consumer Choice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers have increasing access to more holistic information about the providers they consider working with and hiring (e.g., realtors, designers), including how they spend their free time. This research examines how a professional’s disclosure of their leisure activities impacts consumer choice. While the way people spend their leisure time should be unrelated to their professional aptitude, across an online field study and four lab studies, the authors demonstrate that disclosing leisure activities associated with eudaimonic well-being (ie, meaning, fulfillment), such as hiking or cooking, can positively impact consumer choice. Such disclosures, relative to either not disclosing leisure or disclosing less eudaimonic activities such as relaxing or watching television, increase perceptions of competence, and in turn, interest in choosing, hiring, and supporting these individuals. Notably, the effects of eudaimonic leisure on competence and hiring intentions are attenuated if other diagnostic competence cues are present, such as a job- related award, and among those who value productivity less (ie, have a low productivity orientation). Thus, the authors show how seemingly irrelevant personal information about professionals can inform consumer choice. Moreover, by manipulating eudaimonic well-being via leisure disclosures, they demonstrate how such cues impact person perception, integrating research on well-being, self-disclosure, and social perceptions.</content>

    <title>Walrasian Pricing for Combinatorial Markets with Compact-Bidding Languages: An Application to Truckload Transportation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Combinatorial auctions offer several economic advantages but also face multiple technical challenges, including bid generation, the need to solve a combinatorial allocation problem, and determining reasonable prices. These challenges are even more pronounced in a combinatorial exchange, where bidders can simultaneously buy and sell combinations of goods. Motivated by truckload transportation markets, we explore new mechanisms for finding Walrasian equilibrium prices in combinatorial auctions and exchanges where bidders can use a compact-bidding language to express their potentially complex preferences. With the goal of improving economic efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of the trucking industry, we identify significant potential gains by developing a method for integrated allocation and price determination based on an industry-specific bidding language. We also demonstrate our proposed mechanism’s adaptability and flexibility by considering a number of practical constraints.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Concerns about the integrity of statistical analyses have risen in recent years, with particular attention given to “p-hacking”—a process whereby analysts conduct several statistical tests until they achieve a statistically significant result. Although extensively studied in academic settings, less is known about its prevalence in industrial contexts. In this study, we investigate whether p-hacking occurs in e-commerce A/B testing. We analyzed nearly 2,300 A/B tests conducted by hundreds of firms using a large A/B testing platform. Such platforms typically offer continuous monitoring of test results, a feature that facilitates real-time decision making but also enables potential p-hacking through selective stopping or continuation of experiments. Contrary to concerns raised by earlier research on academic practices, we found no significant evidence of p-hacking in our sample. These findings suggest that the industrial application of experimentation may be less susceptible to p-hacking than academic research. We discuss several possible factors explaining the divergent results, highlighting the potential role of organizational learning and the importance of economic incentives. Our study contributes to the broader discussion on research integrity and underscores the importance of considering contextual factors in assessing statistical malpractice.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Is there latent demand to support Black-owned businesses? We explore this question by analyzing a new feature that made it easier to identify Black-owned restaurants on an online platform. We find that labeling restaurants as minority-owned increased customer engagement and firm performance, as measured by online traffic, calls, orders, and in-person visits. These effects were more pronounced in areas characterized by greater support for the Democratic Party and lower implicit bias against racial minorities. Labeled restaurants also see an increase in the fraction of reviews that are written by White customers. (JEL D22, J15, L25, L83, L86)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms expect to recover the fixed costs required to start production by earning positive operating profits in subsequent periods. We develop a dynamic competitive benchmark that accounts for start-up costs, showing that static markups overstate the rents attributable to market power in an electricity market where generators frequently stop and start production in response to rooftop solar output. We demonstrate that the large-scale expansion of solar capacity can lead to increases in the collective profitability of fossil fuel plants because competition softens at sunset—plants displaced by solar during the day must incur start-up costs to compete in the evening.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how to regulate a monopolistic firm using a robust-design, non-Bayesian approach. We derive a policy that minimizes the regulator’s worst-case regret, where regret is the difference between the regulator’s complete-information payoff and his realized payoff. When the regulator’s payoff is consumers’ surplus, he caps the firm’s average revenue. When his payoff is the total surplus of both consumers and the firm, he offers a piece rate subsidy to the firm while capping the total subsidy. For intermediate cases, the regulator combines these three policy instruments to balance three goals: protecting consumers’ surplus, mitigating underproduction, and limiting potential overproduction.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study a prominent energy regulation affecting large Chinese manufacturers that are part of broader conglomerates. Using detailed firm-level data and difference-in-differences research designs, we show that regulated firms cut output and shifted some production to unregulated firms within their conglomerate instead of improving their energy efficiency. To account for conglomerate and market spillovers, we interpret these results through the lens of an industry equilibrium model featuring conglomerate production. The policy raises welfare if the per ton benefits of carbon reduction exceed $161. Alternative policies that exploit public information on business networks can increase aggregate energy savings by 10 percent. (JEL D22, L22, L51, L60, P28, P31, Q48)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We design and field an innovative survey of unemployment insurance (UI) recipients that yields new insights about wage stickiness on the layoff margin. A majority of UI recipients would accept pay cuts of 5–10 percent to save their jobs, and one-third would accept a 25 percent cut. Yet worker-employer discussions about cuts in pay, benefits, or hours in lieu of layoffs are exceedingly rare. Roughly one-quarter of the layoffs in our sample violate the theoretical condition for bilaterally efficient separations. We draw on our findings and other evidence to assess theories of wage stickiness and its role in layoffs. (JEL C83, E24, J31, J63, J65)</content>

    <title>Political Social Learning: Short-Term Memory and Cycles of Polarization</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates the effect of voters’ short-term memory on political outcomes by considering politics as a collective learning process. We find that short-term memory may lead to cycles of polarization and consensus across parties’ platforms. Following periods of party consensus, short-term memory implies that there is little variation in voters’ data and therefore limited information about the true state of the world. This in turn allows parties to further their own interests and hence polarize by offering different policies. In contrast, periods of polarization and turnover involve sufficient variation in the data that allows voters to be confident about what the correct policy is, forcing both parties to offer this policy.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Applicants to schools, colleges, and jobs hedge by applying to a broad range of options, including reaches, matches, and safeties. We develop a simultaneous-search framework that rationalizes this practice. In this framework, the admissions process is correlated across schools so that if an applicant is rejected by one school, she is more likely to be rejected by more selective schools. We find that an applicant then optimally targets both safeties and reaches. We characterize how the optimal portfolio varies with the applicant’s beliefs, risk attitudes, and application costs and offer an algorithm that delivers the optimal portfolio in polynomial time.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Should central banks’ inflation targets remain set in stone? We study a dynamic mechanism design problem between a government and a central bank. The central bank has persistent private information about structural shocks. Firms learn the state from the central bank’s reports and form inflation expectations. A dynamic inflation target implements the full-information commitment allocation. The central bank is delegated the authority to adjust the target’s level and flexibility one period in advance. A declining natural interest rate and a flattening Phillips curve imply opposite optimal target adjustments. Our results speak to practical policy questions of inflation target design.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study reputation dynamics within the household in a setting where women regularly receive transfers from their husbands for household purchases. We propose a signaling model in which wives try to maintain a good reputation in the eyes of their husbands to receive high transfers. This leads them to (i) avoid risky purchases (goods with unknown returns) and (ii) knowingly overuse low-return goods to hide bad purchase decisions—we call this the intrahousehold sunk cost effect. We present supportive evidence for the model from a series of experiments with married couples in rural Malawi. (JEL D13, D82, J12, J16, O12, O18)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We test the effectiveness of a behavioral program grounded in the idea that status granting and self-persuasion might yield a robust behavioral change in disadvantaged adolescents. We enlist socially connected senior middle school students with high emotional intelligence as “student-teachers” and entrust them with delivering a curriculum to their junior peers. The program empowers student-teachers, leading them to improve their social environment. It reduces disciplinary incidents and antisocial behavior among student-teachers and their friendship networks. The intervention significantly enhances the likelihood of admission to selective high schools for student-teachers, offering a cost-effective way to help disadvantaged adolescents escape neighborhood disadvantages.
