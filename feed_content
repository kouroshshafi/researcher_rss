    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Balancing Flexibility and Performance in Online Resource AllocationHow do firms optimize resource allocation strategies when frequent adjustments are costly or restricted? A new study published in Operations Research by David Simchi-Levi, Yunzong Xu, and Jinglong Zhao explores this challenge through the lens of “Blind Network Revenue Management and Bandits with Knapsacks Under Limited Switches.” The paper investigates the impact of a switching constraint, which limits the number of times a firm can adjust allocations, on dynamic decision making, demand learning, and resource management. By establishing matching upper and lower regret bounds, the authors show how the statistical complexity of online learning changes when both resource and switching constraints are present. Their findings reveal that the optimal regret rate follows a piecewise-constant function of the switching budget, providing key insights into algorithmic design for constrained decision making. The study’s simulations demonstrate that firms can maintain strong performance and significantly reduce adjustments, offering practical implications for industries with operational rigidity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Achieving system‐level change for climate transitions is needed, and incremental efforts are widely considered insufficient. Drawing on neo‐Schumpeterian, cultural‐institutionalist, and post‐structuralist theories, thisPoint‐Counterpointdebate explores the systemic barriers including neoliberal policies, corporate hegemony, and growth‐driven cultural logics which inhibit the kind of change that is needed to mitigate increasingly devastating climatic conditions. Our contributors propose a range of potential solutions which may break these barriers and deliver the required radical system‐level change. These include further and better democratization, quixotic institutional work so as to undermine dominant cultural templates, the use of various counter‐hegemonic practices, and the development of alternative forms of organizing. In this introduction, we explore contact and departure points between the three positions and offer some critical reflections and future research questions on the idea of system‐level change.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the capital market implications of common investor relations (IR) representation, a phenomenon in which multiple public firms share the same external IR representative. Using a difference‐in‐differences research design, I document that common IR representation is associated with greater overlap in institutional ownership and sell‐side analyst coverage as well as similarities in disclosure practices among clients—even those operating in different industries. These effects culminate in heightened return comovement among firms sharing IR representation. My findings provide insight into the role of IR companies as capital market gatekeepers and suggest that when a firm outsources its IR function, the IR company influences its capital market connectivity.</content>

    <title>Team-Enacted Use versus Developer-Needed Use of Agile Practices: How Perceptual (In-)Congruence and Team Feedback-Seeking Shape Developer Well-Being</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Are agile practices always beneficial for developers? Although agile methods, such as daily stand-ups or pair programming, are designed to enhance flexibility and productivity, developers often experience a mismatch between the team-enacted use of these practices and their own individual needs. Using daily survey responses from 149 agile developers (1,510 observations), our study uncovers a crucial yet overlooked factor; perceived (in-)congruence between team-enacted and developer-needed agile practices significantly impacts developer well-being. We show that alignment between the use and need of agile practices is associated with higher well-being, whereas mismatches—both excessive and insufficient agile practices—can be detrimental. Interestingly, we find that frequent team feedback seeking amplifies the negative effects of misalignment but does not enhance well-being when alignment is achieved. These findings challenge the assumption that the use of agile practices is inherently beneficial and highlight the need for a tailored, developer-centric approach. For organizations, the key takeaway is clear. A “one-size-fits-all” approach to agile practices can backfire. Instead, fostering alignment through adaptive work environments, flexible agile practice use, and targeted interventions can promote sustainable developer well-being and long-term agile team effectiveness.</content>

    <title>Revealed Beliefs and the Marriage Market Return to Education</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a new methodology to estimate subjective beliefs from hypothetical choice data. Our identification approach is based on the novel insight that by varying the amount of information on future realizations of stochastic variables, discrete choice experiments can identify not only preferences, but also subjective beliefs. We formally prove this result in a general setting and apply it to design a strategic survey instrument to measure Rajasthani parents’ subjective beliefs over the joint distribution of girls’ age of marriage, education, and marriage match quality. Our approach allows us to quantify the importance of perceived marriage market returns to education and youth, and perform various counterfactual simulation exercises. We find that eliminating the perceived marriage market return to education causes a 60% drop in the number of girls still in school at age-16, and almost none continue their education by age-18. Responses to our strategic survey instrument allow us accurately to predict realized schooling trajectories in follow-up data we collect from the same sample five years after our experimental data collection.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: General Behavioral Impact of Smart System Warnings: A Case of Advanced Driving Assistance Systems</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The rise of the Internet of Things has led to a surge in smart products with various embedded sensors that can provide alerts and warnings to users. However, these alerts can also influence user general behavior, which has implications for product and service design. In this study, we evaluate the effect of Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) warnings on general driving behavior using automotive telematics data from a large automotive company. We categorize ADAS systems in terms of the urgency of response required by their warning signals and theorize that this urgency triggers different types of cognitive responses. Specifically, less urgent alerts lead to deliberate learning (System 2), improving driving behavior, while highly urgent warnings trigger automatic responses (System 1), potentially leading to risk compensation and worsening driving behavior. Our results confirm that the impact of ADAS warnings on driving behavior varies based on the urgency of the required response to warnings. The presence of a blind spot detection warning, which is less urgent with no immediate action, reduces the daily number of hard braking (speeding) events by 6.76% (9.34%). In contrast, lane departure and forward collision warnings, both of which are highly urgent and require immediate responses, increase the daily number of hard braking (speeding) events by 5.65% (5.34%). Additionally, we find that, over time, the positive impact of the blind spot detection feature improves, while the negative impact of the lane departure and forward collision features worsens. Finally, we quantify the indirect impact of ADAS features on collision rates through driving behavior. Specifically, we find that the presence of the blind spot detection feature decreases the collision rate by 2.17% (3.14%) through a reduction in hard braking (speeding) incidents. In contrast, the presence of lane departure and forward collision features reduces the safety benefits of preventing collisions by 1.71% (1.66%) due to an increase in hard braking (speeding) events. Our results demonstrate how user behavior varies with the type of ADAS based on the urgency of warnings and the need to integrate user behavior into the design of smart features such as ADAS and related services.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Enterprise Social Media Platform Design and Knowledge Worker Productivity</title>
    <updated>2025-04-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Companies often use enterprise social media platforms (ESMPs) to promote helping behavior among knowledge workers and to improve their productivity. However, many ESMP implementations have had mixed success due to employee reluctance to engage with the platform (e.g. by requesting and giving help). Prominent ESMPs have added varying design features to promote helping behavior, but the effectiveness of individual design features remains unclear. Our paper studies this using a laboratory experiment that consists of two studies. In Study 1, we explore the effect of individual design features on a participant’s decision to make and answer help requests, and the impact that has on their performance. Our first two treatments vary the level of platform helping behavior visible to participants. Our third treatment sets helping goals that participants can complete by making and answering help requests and rewards them with private badges for doing so. We find that only the treatment with helping goals and badges results in a significant 5.5% increase in participant performance. It achieves this primarily by increasing a participant’s propensity to request help and, to a lesser degree, their propensity to answer help requests. In Study 2, we show that similar improvements can be achieved with just a helping goal that asks participants to help others (without a badge). This speaks to the effectiveness of using goal setting motivation to leverage an individual’s intrinsic motivation to help others, even when it comes at a cost to themselves. Interestingly, we further show that helping goals that explicitly ask participants to help others also encourage participants to request more help, increasing the overall use of the platform. Based on our findings, we encourage companies to adopt ESMPs with badges for the helping goals they have. We also encourage ESMPs that do not have badges to consider adding them natively to their platforms.</content>

    <title>Confronting the Limits of Symbolic Actions: How Entrepreneurs Narrow the Presentation-Performance Gap</title>
    <updated>2025-04-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs often skillfully leverage symbolic actions to manage impressions and gain acceptance for their innovations. Impression management can generate interest but also heighten expectations beyond an innovation’s capabilities, creating a gap between entrepreneurs’ symbolic presentations and an innovation’s performance. To convince critical audiences, entrepreneurs need to not just manage impressions but also show how their innovations will integrate and work in situ. Yet, little research explains what happens when symbolic actions meet their limits. How do entrepreneurs respond when critical audiences challenge their symbolic actions? We examine how 28 digital health start-ups were challenged by a critical audience (buyers), revealing a gap between entrepreneurs’ symbolic presentations and the performance of their innovations. We examine how entrepreneurs managed this gap with buyers at 13 organizations and identify three pathways. Continuing to manage impressions obfuscated the discovery of integration work, widening the gap. Iterating with substantive adaptations did not sufficiently narrow the gap. Only entrepreneurs who recalibrated expectations were able to enlist buyers in the mutual discovery of integration work. These entrepreneurs shared the costs of narrowing the gap with buyers, despite earlier symbolic promises. We contribute to an emerging appreciation of the duality of symbolic actions by explaining what happens when entrepreneurs’ symbolic actions are challenged and how their responses can exacerbate or eradicate that challenge.Funding: The authors acknowledge the financial support of the Harvard Business School and the Questrom School of Business, Boston University.</content>

    <title>Nonparametric Estimation of Sponsored Search Auctions and Impact of Ad Quality on Search Revenue</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper presents an empirical model of sponsored search auctions where advertisers are ranked by bid and ad quality. Our model is developed under the “incomplete information” setting with a general quality scoring rule. We establish nonparametric identification of the advertiser’s valuation and its distribution given observed bids and introduce novel nonparametric estimators. Using Yahoo! search auction data, we estimate value distributions and study the bidding behavior across product categories. We also conduct a counterfactual analysis to evaluate the impact of different quality scoring rules on the auctioneer’s revenue. Product-specific scoring rules can enhance auctioneer revenue by at most 24.3% at the expense of advertiser profit (−28.3%) and consumer welfare (−30.2%). The revenue-maximizing scoring rule depends on market competitiveness.This paper was accepted by Jean-Pierre Dube, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada under the Insight Development Grant [Grant 430-2022-00841] to D.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using novel data on 1,240 credit agreements, we investigate sources of contractual complexity in the leveraged loan market. Although negative covenants are widespread, carve-out and deductible clauses that qualify them are as frequent. We propose simple and comprehensive measures of contractual weakness based on the usage of such clauses. The economic significance of the actions allowed by these clauses and the market-wide price reaction that followed the 2017 J.Crew restructuring, a high-profile use of such contractual elements, support this interpretation. Leveraged buyouts, large transactions, and nonbank funding are conducive to weaker contractual terms for credit agreements.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01496 .</content>

    <title>The Economics of Advice: Evidence from Start-up Mentoring</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the role of advice in early firm development and growth, drawing on detailed data from a global program where angel investors and venture capitalists (VCs) mentored founders over several months. Leveraging variation in mentors’ availability to support start-ups because of personal scheduling conflicts, I find that advice significantly improves start-ups’ future market performance. To explore how advice shapes early firm development, I develop a novel typology of start-up activities, finding that a defining element of mentors’ advice is to do less and learn more. Although angels and VCs are consistent in this message, they differ significantly in when they choose to advise start-ups in achieving their business objectives. Angels are more likely than VCs to help founders design and execute product market experiments, whereas VCs provide more mentoring support on business analysis and planning tasks. I find evidence consistent with the hypothesis that experimentation is a skill developed via learning-by-doing, and angels have a skill advantage in that domain because of having more operational experience.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: The author acknowledges support from the Government of Canada’s Strategic Innovation Fund [Grant 811949] and RBC Borealis Graduate Fellowship [Grant 2018-0439].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05115 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traffic safety poses a persistent challenge for society and public policy. Conventional law enforcement by human police is often cost-ineffective because of information asymmetry and negative externalities of unsafe driving behaviors. Automated enforcement, in the form of traffic cameras on the road, has gained prominence in recent decades, yet its effectiveness and underlying mechanisms remain debated. This study examines the impact of traffic cameras on road safety using longitudinal data from a metropolitan city in China. We distinguish between advanced cameras, which use machine learning to detect various traffic violations and constantly record video, and conventional cameras, which rely on triggered image capture for a limited number of violations. Using an event study design with staggered camera installations at road intersections, we observe a significant and sustained reduction in accidents near advanced cameras, compared with locations with no cameras or only conventional cameras. Further analysis identifies three key mechanisms driving the effects of advanced cameras: (i) automated detection effect—superior technical capabilities to automate violation detection; (ii) real-time recording effect—continuous monitoring and recording capability to augment accident cause identification; and (iii) driver learning effect—technology-enabled deterrence that increases driver awareness of these cameras and encourages behavioral adjustments to mitigate accident risks. This study contributes to information systems, transportation economics, and criminology, offering policy insights into the effective design and deployment of automated enforcement to improve traffic safety.This paper was accepted by D.

    <title>Spillover Effects From Health Information Systems Integration: Evidence From Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To ease prescribers' burden in using statewide Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs), many US states have moved to better integrate PDMP data with patients' electronic health records (EHRs). While such PDMP‐EHR integration is likely to reduce local formal prescription opioid consumption, in this paper, we explore the possibility that it induces individuals to seek opioids across state borders and/or at the local black market. We find that for a focal county, its neighboring state's PDMP‐EHR integration leads to an increase in the focal county's consumption of prescription opioids, an undesirable cross‐border spillover effect. Moreover, we find that this spillover effect is mitigated when prescribers in the focal county have access to the neighboring state's PDMP data via interstate PDMP data sharing. We also find nuanced evidence that a state's PDMP‐EHR integration might induce an increase in its black‐market prices of prescription opioids. While vertical information integration in a region (i.e., a state's PDMP‐EHR integration) may fulfill its intended benefit, our findings suggest it may also result in a spillover effect on neighboring areas. Notably, a complementary horizontal information integration (in this case, interstate PDMP data sharing) could mitigate such an undesirable spillover effect. We discuss implications for the design of care delivery processes, particularly prescription processes, that rely on the studied health information systems.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Power of Proximity: Exploring Narrative Language in Consumer Reviews</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Marketers know the importance of online reviews, but what can be done to improve the prompts asking consumers to review? Across eight studies, the present work shows that a prompt that encourages writing reviews for a close audience enhances consumers’ use of narrative language. A growing body of literature reveals that narratives are powerful persuasive devices for shaping audiences’ beliefs, including when reading online reviews. However, little is known about what aspects shape the communicator’s use of narrative language in the first place. A prompt that encourages writers to imagine as though they were writing for a close audience increases narrativity, an effect mediated by consumers’ tendency to write in a natural, less effortful style when writing for a close (vs. distant) audience. The effect is attenuated when people write about material (vs. experiential) purchases, and when people write on a smartphone (vs. PC). Consumers find writing for close others to be at least as enjoyable as several other prompts, but with improved outcomes for firms. As most review sites provide limited guidance on how to write, this research offers an inexpensive and scalable intervention to improve reviews and the review writing experience.</content>

    <title>Beyond Digital vs. IT: The Untold Story of Their Relationship from an Organizing Logic Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations often feature digital and information technology (IT) units, suggesting that managers perceive digital technology as different from IT. However, these units do not coexist in silos; rather, they interact in pursuit of organizational goals. In this study, we investigate the interactions between the digital and IT units of three organizations undergoing digital transformation. We find that these interactions reflect three relationships with varying dynamics. The interplay of these dynamics shape organization’s digital transformation efforts. We outline three considerations for managing these dynamics productively. First, we outline conditions that determine the dynamic (e.g., synergistic or conflicting) more likely to manifest. These conditions depend on the (in)compatibility between the units’ need to interact and the strategic, routine or technology rationales they draw on. We caution against seeking compatibility at all costs. Rather, managers should consider the context of each interaction before deciding how to influence these dynamics. Second, we found that interpersonal relationships, hiring talent with diverse perspectives, or establishing idea exchange forums can help to foster productive collaborations. However, they alone do not determine these dynamics. Third, cross-unit relationships is important for accomplishing organizational goals like digital transformation. Managers should proactively nurture such relationships to foster collaboration among units.</content>

    <title>An Equilibrium Model of Imperfect Hedging: Transaction Costs, Heterogeneity in Risk Aversion, and Return Volatility</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Financial transaction taxes, or generally transaction costs, are salient in derivatives markets and seldom studied in equilibrium models. We study a tractable model with proportional transaction costs where agents trade a derivative with nonlinear payoffs to hedge nontraded endowments. We show that trade is sustained in an equilibrium with transaction costs only if there is sufficient heterogeneity in risk aversion. When there is trade, the equilibrium return variance increases in transaction costs. These results are driven by how mean-variance demands, hedging demands, and asymmetry of no-transaction region widths determine the equilibrium Sharpe ratio and return volatility when transaction costs change.

    <title>The Value of Privacy in Cartels: An Analysis of the Inner Workings of a Bidding Ring</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how incentive constraints can be relaxed by randomization in a repeated-game setting. Our study is motivated by the workings of a detected bidding cartel that adopted a protocol of keeping the winning bid secret from the designated losers when defection was a concern. Keeping the winning bid secret makes accurately undercutting the winning bid more difficult and makes defection less attractive as potential defectors risk not winning the auction even if they deviate. We formalize these ideas in the context of a repeated-game setting and show that a cartel can attain higher payoffs by having the pre-selected winner randomize its bid and keep it secret from other members. Calibration of the model to the bid data of the cartel suggests that randomization may increase firms’ profits by about 56%.</content>

    <title>Belief Identification by Proxy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is well known that individual beliefs cannot be identified using traditional choice data, unless we exogenously assume state-independent utilities. In this paper, I propose a novel methodology that solves this long-standing identification problem in a simple way. This method relies on extending the state space by introducing a proxy, for which the agent has no stakes conditional on the original state space. The latter allows us to identify the agent’s conditional beliefs about the proxy given each state realization, which in turn suffices for indirectly identifying her beliefs about the original state space. This approach is analogous to the one of instrumental variables in econometrics. Similarly to instrumental variables, the appeal of this method comes from the flexibility in selecting a proxy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;I develop an analytical model to examine the effect of disclosure on organizational structure. In this model, an owner with two investment projects decides whether to organize them as a single multidivisional firm or two stand-alone firms whose manager(s) may issue a truthful but costly disclosure of each project’s profitability to raise capital. In a multidivisional firm, capital is initially provided by investors and subsequently allocated across the two projects by the manager. The analysis shows that a multidivisional structure allows for efficient internal capital allocation while avoiding disclosure costs, whereas a stand-alone structure prevents inefficient cross-subsidization. Specifically, a multidivisional structure is optimal when disclosure costs are high relative to project payoffs. These results help explain empirical evidence that multidivisional firms tend to trade at a discount.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Ananthakrishnan, accounting.</content>

    <title>Relaxed Indexability and Index Policy for Partially Observable Restless Bandits</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper addresses an important class of restless multiarmed bandit (RMAB) problems that finds broad application in operations research, stochastic optimization, and reinforcement learning. There are N independent Markov processes that may be operated, observed and offer rewards. Due to the resource constraint, we can only choose a subset of [Formula: see text] processes to operate and accrue reward determined by the states of selected processes. We formulate the problem as a partially observable RMAB with an infinite state space and design an algorithm that achieves a near-optimal performance with low complexity. Our algorithm is based on a generalization of Whittle’s original idea of indexability. Referred to as the relaxed indexability, the extended definition leads to the efficient online verifications and computations of the approximate Whittle index under the proposed algorithmic framework.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02831 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using international data, we quantify the magnitude of survivorship bias in U.S. equity market performance, finding that it explains about one‐third of the equity risk premium in the past century. We model the subjective crash belief of an investor who infers the crash risk in the United States by cross‐learning from other countries. The U.S. crash probability shows a persistent and widening divergence from the implied global average. We attribute the upward bias in the measured equity premium to crashes that did not occur in‐sample and to shocks to valuations resulting from learning about the probability.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the contribution of banks and nonbanks to cyclical fluctuations in the supply of syndicated loans. We find that a reduction in nonbank lending explains most of the contraction in syndicated credit and the associated employment losses during the Global Financial Crisis, while banks’ contribution is small. Looking over multiple cycles, we find nonbanks’ credit supply is roughly three times as cyclical as banks’, suggesting that nonbanks are the main drivers of syndicated lending cycles. A model in which government support stabilizes bank funding can explain the higher cyclicality of nonbanks. (JEL G21, G23, E32, E44, G01)</content>

    <title>Split Liver Transplantation: An Analytical Decision Support Model</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research study introduces a decision support model for split liver transplantation (SLT). SLT is a procedure that can save two lives with one donated liver, thereby increasing the total benefit derived from the limited number of donated livers available. SLT may also improve equity by giving transplant candidates who are physically smaller, including children, increased access to liver transplants. However, SLT is rarely used in the United States. To help quantify the benefits of increased SLT utilization and provide decision support tools, this research presents a deceased-donor liver allocation model that incorporates both efficiency and fairness objectives. We formulate the liver waitlists as a multiqueue fluid system, incorporating specifics of donor-recipient size matching and patients’ dynamically changing health conditions. Leveraging a novel decomposition result, the study finds the exact optimal matching procedure, enabling policy makers to benchmark the performance of different allocation policies against the theoretical optimal. Numerical results, utilizing data from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, show that increased utilization of SLT can significantly reduce patient deaths, increase total quality-adjusted life years, and improve fairness among different patient groups.</content>

This usually creates a suboptimal weighting scheme in which the part of the system that represents the first hurdle is overvalued. I explain why “multiple hurdle” reviewing is counterproductive and offer a superior alternative.</content>

    <title>Standing on the Shoulders of (Male) Giants: Gender Inequality and the Technological Impact of Scientific Ideas</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Science is fundamental to the innovation process; however, not all scientific ideas significantly contribute to shaping technological developments. In this article, we argue that, despite having strong incentives to build on the most promising ideas, inventors rely more on research conducted by men than by women. We analyze the citations that scientific papers receive in patented inventions and find that the papers authored by women scientists receive fewer citations, both in a large sample of over 10 million papers and in a smaller sample of simultaneous discoveries. We systematically explore the mechanisms underlying this finding, including an online experiment conducted with 400 individuals holding science doctoral degrees. Our results suggest that the gender disparity in patent-to-paper citations is unlikely to stem entirely from supply-side mechanisms such as access to resources, networks, and scientific style. Instead, the results align with demand-side explanations, in particular the notion that inventors pay more attention to and place higher value on scientific publications authored by men. These findings have implications for our understanding of friction in science-based technology development, as well as for broader theories of how gender inequality shapes cumulative innovation.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how risk management through hedging affects firms and competition among firms in the life insurance industry, an industry with over 7 trillion in assets and over 1,000 private and public firms. We examine firms after a staggered state-level reform that reduces the costs of hedging by granting derivatives superpriority in case of insolvency. We show that firms that are likely to face costly external finance increase hedging and reduce risk and the probability of receivership. Firms that are likely to face costly external finance also lower prices, increase policy sales, and increase their market share post-reform. (JEL D02, D43, G22, G28, G32, G33)</content>

    <title>Competitive Manufacturers Product-Sharing Strategies: P2P Sharing or B2C Sharing?</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With the rapid development of the sharing economy, many traditional manufacturers gravitate toward the paradigm shift to embrace product/service sharing with B2C (i.e., business-to-consumer) and P2P (i.e., peer-to-peer) sharing models. We develop a duopoly model to investigate the strategic decisions of competing manufacturers regarding three product-sharing strategies: no-sharing (i.e., sales-only), P2P sharing (i.e., sharing products on a P2P platform in addition to sales), and B2C sharing (i.e., renting products with add-ons on a B2C platform in addition to sales). The findings reveal that P2P sharing and B2C sharing play distinct roles in a competitive environment. P2P sharing has a scale effect, incentivizing manufacturers to expand market share and increase profitability. B2C sharing has a price discrimination effect, enabling the high-quality manufacturer to enhance price competitiveness and achieve higher profits. Moreover, the equilibrium outcomes for manufacturers depend on the quality difference and the add-on value. When the add-on value is low and the quality difference is high, both manufacturers prefer the P2P sharing strategy. Otherwise, manufacturers are more inclined to differentiate their sharing strategies, with the low-quality manufacturer favoring P2P sharing and the high-quality manufacturer preferring B2C sharing. Furthermore, compared with manufacturers adopting the no-sharing strategy, the low-quality manufacturer and the high-quality manufacturer are in (i) a lose–win situation when both adopt the P2P strategy; (ii) a win–win situation when manufacturers prefer the differentiated strategy. Notably, irrespective of the sharing strategy adopted, consumer surplus and social welfare are invariably augmented relative to the no-sharing scenario. The relative magnitudes of consumer surplus and social welfare under different equilibrium strategies are influenced by the quality difference and the add-on value. By extending the model, we derive further insights and demonstrate that the main results are robust under some conditions.</content>

    <title>Random Graph Matching at Otter’s Threshold via Counting Chandeliers</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Network alignment or graph matching—figuring out how vertices across different networks correspond to each other—is a key challenge in many fields, from protecting online privacy to mapping biological data, improving computer vision, and even understanding languages. However, this problem falls into the class of notoriously difficult quadratic assignment problems, which are NP-hard to solve or approximate. Despite these challenges, researchers Mao, Wu, Xu, and Yu have made a major breakthrough. In their paper, “Random Graph Matching at Otter’s Threshold via Counting Chandeliers,” they introduce an innovative algorithm that can successfully match two random networks whenever the square of their edge correlation exceeds Otter’s constant (≈0.338). Their key innovation lies in counting chandeliers—specially designed tree-like structures—to identify corresponding vertices across the networks. The algorithm correctly matches nearly all vertices with high probability and even achieves perfect matching whenever the data allows. This is the first-ever polynomial-time algorithm capable of achieving perfect and near-perfect matching with an explicit constant correlation for both dense and sparse networks, bridging a long-standing gap between statistical limits and algorithmic performance.</content>

    <title>The Limits to Learning a Diffusion Model</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper provides the first sample complexity lower bounds for the estimation of simple diffusion models, including the Bass model (used in modeling consumer adoption) and the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model (used in modeling epidemics). We show that one cannot hope to learn such models until quite late in the diffusion. Specifically, we show that the time required to collect a number of observations that exceeds our sample complexity lower bounds is large. For the Bass model, our results imply that when new adopters are predominantly driven by imitation, one cannot hope to predict the eventual number of adopting customers until one is at least two-thirds of the way to the time at which the rate of new adopters is at its peak. In a similar vein, our results imply that in the case of an SIR model, one cannot hope to predict the eventual number of infections until one is approximately two-thirds of the way to the time at which the infection rate has peaked. This lower bound in estimation further translates into a lower bound in regret for decision making in epidemic interventions. Our results formalize the challenge of accurate forecasting and highlight the importance of incorporating additional data sources. To this end, we analyze the benefit of a seroprevalence study in an epidemic, where we characterize the size of the study needed to improve SIR model estimation. Extensive empirical analyses on product adoption and epidemic data support our theoretical findings.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, data science.Funding: This work was supported by the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation [Grant 1727239].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02953 .</content>

    <title>Algorithmic Writing Assistance on Jobseekers’ Resumes Increases Hires</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is a strong association between writing quality in resumes for new labor market entrants and whether they are ultimately hired. We show this relationship is, at least partially, causal: In a field experiment in an online labor market with nearly half a million jobseekers, treated jobseekers received nongenerative algorithmic writing assistance on their resumes. Treated jobseekers were hired 8% more often at 10% higher wages. Contrary to concerns that the assistance takes away a valuable signal, we find no evidence that employers were less satisfied. We find that the writing on treated jobseekers resumes had fewer errors and was easier to read. Our analysis suggests that writing is an imperfect signal of ability but better writing helps employers ascertain ability through clearer writing, suggesting digital platforms could benefit from incorporating nongenerative algorithmic writing assistance into text-based descriptions of labor services or products.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: J. Horton and E. Wiles received funding from the online labor market on which this experiment was run. No authors received funding from the Algorithmic Writing Service.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.04528 .</content>

    <title>The Role of Monitoring Effect in Risk Classification: Evidence from Telematics Adoption</title>
    <updated>2025-04-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) empowers firms to collect and analyze individual consumers’ activities to classify customer types based on their actions and behaviors that are traditionally unobservable. Although behavioral tracking has become more prevalent in practice, its effectiveness in classifying customer types has hardly been discussed. We utilize detailed individual-level data from a field experiment conducted by an insurance company and its car rental partner to show that tracking using IoT devices such as telematics induces a monitoring effect that sways consumers to behave differently than usual when they are monitored, which significantly undermines the effectiveness of using temporal behavioral tracking data to classify individual types. More importantly, the magnitude of the monitoring effect is correlated with drivers’ unobserved inherent behavior, the very behavior that the tracking devices target to uncover. This correlation is fundamentally different from the typical heterogeneity in effects driven by observable characteristics. Our exercise demonstrates that even if firms recognize the existence of the monitoring effect, overlooking this correlation can more than double the misclassification rate, rendering the classification strategy less effective compared with the traditional classification approach based on customer profiles and sensitive to customer self-selection. Furthermore, we show that the monitoring effect spills over into the postmonitoring period and manifests through both habit formation and crowd-out effects. The direction and the magnitude of the postmonitoring effect vary across individuals. These findings alert practitioners about the caveats in utilizing temporal behavioral tracking data to classify customer types. Suggestive solutions for firms to properly adjust for the influence of the monitoring effect are also provided.This paper was accepted by D. J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Accounting Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A significant portion of a merger's purchase price is allocated to goodwill. Currently, goodwill is not amortized but rather tested annually for impairment. When managers of acquiring firms care about earnings, goodwill's accounting treatment can have large effects on future earnings and may influence how much a manager will bid for a target company. We quantify the effects of goodwill accounting by estimating a structural model of corporate takeovers. Our estimates suggest accrual accounting increases buyout premia by an average of approximately 11 percentage points. If firms needed to amortize goodwill over 10 years, we estimate premia would reduce by 4.9 percentage points and M&amp;A volume would shrink by 4.1% or $67 billion per year. Furthermore, the fraction of private equity acquirers would increase by 6.9 percentage points, shifting control over productive assets to the private and financial sector. Our results suggest the accounting treatment for goodwill has a meaningful effect on the market for corporate control.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Non-family-based institutions for socializing young people may play a vital role in creating close-knit, inclusive communities. We study the potential for youth camps—integrating rituals, sports, and civics training—to strengthen intergroup cohesion. We randomly assigned Hindu and Muslim adolescent boys, from West Bengal, India, to two-week camps or to a pure control arm. To isolate mechanisms, we cross-randomized collective rituals (such as singing the national anthem, wearing uniforms, chanting support during matches, and synchronous dancing) and the intensity of intergroup contact. We find that camps reduce ingroup bias, increase willingness to interact with outgroup members, and enhance psychological well-being. Campers continue to have twice as many outgroup friends than control participants one year after the camps ended. Meanwhile, additional camp elements have heterogeneous effects: rituals have more positive impacts for the Hindu majority than the Muslim minority, while higher intergroup contact backfires among Hindus but not Muslims. Our findings demonstrate that inclusive youth camps may be a powerful tool for bridging deep social divides. Yet, we also highlight the conceptual challenges in crafting optimal integrative camps that help all groups.</content>

    <title>The Impact of “Lazy Minting” on Seller Performance in &lt;scp&gt;NFT&lt;/scp&gt; Marketplaces—A Transaction Cost Economics Perspective</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the burgeoning marketplaces of digital assets, non‐fungible tokens (NFTs) revolutionize digital asset ownership and intellectual property (IP) protection, but high minting costs create barriers to marketplace entry and growth. This study examines the impact of “lazy minting,” a new NFT production method introduced by major NFT marketplaces to lower minting costs by deferring blockchain certification until the first sale. In response to the call for further research on emerging technologies in operations management, we explore how this policy affects the net sales performance of existing sellers in the NFT marketplaces. Based on transaction cost economics (TCE) and the literature about different IP protection methods, we distinguish between lazy‐ and regular‐minted NFTs by their differential transaction costs and utilize the staggered difference‐in‐differences (DID) method to conduct our analysis. We find that lazy minting adoption significantly boosts the net sales performance of existing sellers. This is attributed to their cost‐adaptive IP protection behavior. Specifically, they achieve this by minting more NFTs with a larger proportion of style‐consistent NFTs through lazy minting, while strategically employing regular minting for style‐breaking NFTs, which is contingent upon their reputation. Our study has important theoretical and practical implications for operations management under the emerging technological revolution.</content>

    <title>Putting Out Burning Fires: Investigating the Urgency Triggered By Prohibitive Voice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organizations rely on employees to report problems that hinder organizational effectiveness and on supervisors to resolve those problems. Although prohibitive voice is generally thought to help organizations avoid costly and tragic outcomes, the voice literature has also demonstrated that supervisors respond more negatively to prohibitive voice than promotive voice. This tension motivates our inquiry into a fundamental but overlooked reason as to why supervisors might implement prohibitive voice. Drawing upon theoretical distinctions between prohibitive and promotive voice articulated in the voice literature and regulatory focus theory, we propose that supervisors tend to implement prohibitive voice episodes because they elicit an urgency to respond. We find support for our theoretical model in a field study of 555 discrete voice episodes delivered over the course of four years in a high-speed transit system (Study 1). We reproduce and extend these findings—that supervisors implement prohibitive voice because it triggers an urgency to respond—in a recall experiment in which we find that prevention focus enhances supervisors’ response urgency toward prohibitive voice (Study 2). Taken together, our findings demonstrate that despite the potential negative consequences voicers may incur for speaking up with prohibitive voice, a primary function of prohibitive voice is to elicit response urgency that ultimately generates real change.</content>

    <title>Moving in Tandem or Failing Altogether: Managing Resource Configurations for Responsible Practice Development</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why do so many responsible business initiatives fail? While earlier studies have stressed the lack of commitment, we know little about the ways in which prosocial firms seek to secure the requisite resources to accomplish such practices. This study investigates how the management of multiple resource dependencies impacts the (non)accomplishment of a firm’s aspired responsible practices. A granular, comparative study of six prosocial firms embarking on voluntary environmental practices over a decade shows that mainstreamed development resulted from securing the full-fledged and sustained support of all complementary resource providers over a longer period, whereas practices facing constrained or missing resources turned into partial or outright failures. Securing multiple resources involves several problems (resource inaccessibility, resource dispersion, and resource instability), which firms address through different mechanisms. They empathically mobilize resources to overcome resistance from reluctant actors, enact integrative structures to secure resources from dispersed actors, and reshuffle resources to respond to fluctuations in availability and need. The combined use of these mechanisms does not guarantee success but is imperative to overcome the barriers that threaten the mainstreaming of responsible practices. These insights have implications for the corporate responsibility, resource dependence, and ecosystem literatures.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While many boards adopt technology committees to support firm innovation, the impact of such committees is largely unexplored. We draw on agency and resource dependence theories to suggest that technology committees can improve firm innovation (patenting and new product introductions). We further hypothesize that relevant committee expertise (technology and executive expertise) enhances the effectiveness of the committee, and that the benefit of committee expertise is strengthened when coupled with financial resource provision. Our results support our theorizing about the impact of technology committees—they positively impact new product introductions, although they had no impact on patenting. We also found that committee expertise enhances committee effectiveness, but only when accompanied by greater financial resources. We discuss the implications of optional board structures, such as technology committees and their composition, on firm innovation.</content>

    <title>Human Resource Practices and Employee Trust: A Systematic Review With a Guiding Framework</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Human resource (HR) practices hold great promise in fostering employee trust, and insights into how HR practices relate to employee trust are critical to evidence-informed management. However, extant research findings are fragmented and dispersed across disciplines and use a confusing plethora of concepts, limiting insights. To address these problems, we conducted a systematic review to offer a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of “what,” “how,” and “when” HR practices influence employee trust toward four referents (supervisor, management, peers, and organization). Specifically, we identify the evidence-based patterns regarding “what” HR practices are related to employee trust toward “what” referents, “how” HR practices are related to employee trust, and “when” HR practices are more or less related to employee trust. We find that while bundles of HR practices are positively associated with vertical trust toward management, lateral trust toward peers, and organizational trust, individual HR practices have differential associations with trust toward the four referents, which in turn predict different outcomes. We discuss research limitations and opportunities and provide a framework and set of methodological recommendations to guide a new wave of future research. We propose a broader set of theories to enrich understanding of “how” HR practices lead to employee trust, further clarifications on the HR and trust concepts examined, and explore additional moderators. These efforts will further integrate trust and HR research and generate more rigorous knowledge to inform management of employee trust through HR practices.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A key strategic challenge is balancing exploration and exploitation. When individuals' exploration activity is guided by problemistic search, should managers encourage high aspirations? Past work has shown that optimal aspiration (the aspiration level that leads to the highest level of performance in the long run) is lower in more turbulent environments. This past work assumes that aspirations are specified as absolute performance, but search is often triggered by performance shortfalls relative to others. Using a simple and analytically tractable model, we show that in such cases, the optimal aspiration may instead increase with turbulence (with rank‐based aspirations) or stay constant (with average‐based aspirations). Our analyses have interesting implications for target setting and for understanding how aspiration specification impacts exploration in organizations.Managerial SummaryPerformance targets (aspirations) drive improvement efforts, and thus it is important to understand optimal target levels. Although optimal targets are well known to depend on the uncertainty of the environment, our paper shows that this relationship depends on whether the targets are set in absolute, average‐based, or rank‐based terms. In more uncertain environments, performance targets specified in absolute terms should be lower, while those specified in rank‐based terms (such as aiming to outperform a certain number of competitors) should be higher. The optimal performance target specified relative to average outcomes is always the same: do better than average. We show that these contrasting results are due to the spillover effects of one's own improvements on others. Our paper highlights the implications for how targets should be set in different contexts.</content>

    <title>From perfect to practical: Partial identification methods for causal inference in strategic management research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Strategy and management scholars have increasingly used difference‐in‐differences (DD) and instrumental variables (IV) designs to identify causal effects. These methods rely on untestable identifying assumptions to interpret the results as causal. “partial identification” techniques allow researchers to draw causal inferences from imperfect identification strategies by quantifying how results change with the severity of a violation of the identifying assumption. We explain how these tools work in the context of DD and IV designs, provide practical guidance to apply them, and illustrate their use in an empirical example that investigates how first patents affect inventor mobility. In doing so, we emphasize the role of theory, context, and judgment when deciding how strongly to infer a causal relationship from an empirical result.Managerial SummaryManagers seeking to understand the causal effects of their strategic decisions may struggle to do so when their choices cannot be randomized. In such cases, difference‐in‐differences (DD) and instrumental variable (IV) approaches may be a viable estimation strategy. However, these methods still rely on untestable identifying assumptions and it may not be clear how to interpret the results if those identifying assumptions do not hold. In this study, we describe how “partial identification” methods for DD and IV designs allow managers to draw causal inferences even when the identifying assumptions do not hold exactly. We explain how these tools work, provide practical guidance to apply them, and illustrate their use in an empirical example that investigates how first patents affect inventor mobility. In doing so, we emphasize the role of theory, context, and judgment when deciding how strongly to infer a causal relationship from an empirical result.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The prevalence and development of autonomous vehicle technology can reshape the status quo in vehicle manufacture, transportation, and logistics industries, leading to safer daily travel activities, higher power savings, and lower urban pollution. Traditional autonomous vehicle technology focuses on advancing vehicle-related technology, aiming to equip vehicles with high computational capability at a cost. One key initiative to improve traffic information collection and processing is the development and enhancement of smart road systems. This is often done by deploying a large number of roadside units (RSUs) thanks to the Internet of Things and cloud computing technology. However, few studies have explored RSU location planning problems under uncertainty. Existing RSU location models in dynamic edge computing scheduling mostly ignore uncertainties associated with task transmission and model parameters. We develop a two-stage robust satisficing RSU location model featuring uncertain demands for computing tasks and random delays in task processing and transmission. The optimization model minimizes the riskiness of violating various capacity budgets and task latency thresholds. We reformulate the robust RSU location model as an equivalent mixed-integer convex optimization model that can be solved by a cutting plane algorithm. We propose two acceleration methods to enhance the problem-solving process. The numerical experiments illustrate that our robust model is computationally tractable and outperforms the deterministic model and queuing model in various metrics. The resulting RSU location pattern differs significantly from that of the deterministic and queueing-based models. Specifically, the robust model can reduce computing task transmission quantity, average task completion time, and the magnitude and probability of capacity budget violation both in our grid network and random-generated networks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies a simultaneous-search problem in which a player observes the outcomes sequentially, and must pay reservation fees to maintain eligibility for recalling the earlier offers. We use postgraduate program applications to illustrate the key ingredients of this family of problems. We develop a parsimonious model with two categories of schools: reach schools, which the player feels very happy upon joining, but the chance of getting into one is low; and safety schools, which are a safer choice but not as exciting. The player first decides on the application portfolio, and then the outcomes from the schools applied to arrive randomly over time. We start with the extreme case wherein the safety schools always admit the player, and show that it suffices to focus on the last safety school. This allows us to conveniently represent the player’s value function by a product form of the probability of entering the last safety period and the expected payoff from then on.We show that the player’s payoff after applications is increasing and discrete concave in both the numbers of reach and safety schools, and the optimal number of reach schools increases in the reservation fee. The proof technique utilizes stochastic coupling, stochastic dominance, and directional monotone comparative statics arguments. We also develop a recursive dynamic programming algorithm when admissions to safety schools are no longer guaranteed. We demonstrate instances in which the player applies to more safety schools when either the reservation fee gets higher or the admission probability drops lower, and articulate how these arise from the portfolio optimization consideration.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Boundary organizations aim to facilitate collective efforts, but their collaborative arrangements often fall short of initial expectations, face member exits, or experience escalating conflicts. How do diverse members of these boundary organizations stay together and pursue collective goals despite tensions with their individual goals? Drawing on the concept of agency, we explore how members respond to these tensions and reshape the boundary organization’s goals to better align with their own, while maintaining collaboration for the pursuit of collective goals. Based on an in-depth longitudinal case study of a boundary organization in the energy sector, we developed a process model that explains how and why agency evolves over time. It outlines different trajectories through which members achieve a balance between collective and member goals, offering insights into how boundary organizations can either sustain themselves or fail. Our findings emphasize that goal pursuit is a dynamic process, where members continuously shift their focus between collective and member goals to maintain a balance over time. The process model explicates the agentic mechanisms behind these shifts in focus, revealing a dynamic interplay between two forms of agency that differ in their temporal orientation and locus of agency. We extend prior research that has focused on the governance structures and organizing practices in boundary organizations, by offering insights into why these boundary organizations may prevail, as they continuously shift their agency to navigate resurfacing tensions.Funding: This work was supported by the Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research–Competence Center for Research in Energy, Society and Transition (SCCER CREST) [Grant 1155000154].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.16973 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Contemporary trends in the buying behavior of increasingly technology-empowered business customers are triggering disruptive shifts in B2B selling and sales management, which have recently been the subject of extensive research. So far, however, there has been no comprehensive investigation into how foundational elements of B2B selling, encompassing its purpose, the salesperson’s role, and core selling activities, are being impacted by rapidly evolving B2B buying behaviors. This research probes this issue, drawing on the theories-in-use of B2B executives and salespeople struggling to meet today’s B2B selling challenges. The authors find that a novel selling paradigm is emerging, which they callHolistic Selling (HS). The paper details how HS differs from the existing paradigms of personal selling, relational selling, and digital selling regarding the foundational elements of B2B selling. Under HS, the key role of the salesperson evolves from ‘order getting’ or ‘long-term relationship building’ in existing paradigms to‘orchestrating’all buyer-seller touchpoints toboost buyersalongbuyer-ledpurchase journeys. Propositions are provided for the effect of HS versus other paradigms onbuying effectivenessat different purchase journey stages, along with key boundary conditions of this effect. The paper closes with implications for reorienting B2B sales organizations and future research directions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Business collective action (BCA) has long been a topic of interest to management scholars. However, our theoretical understanding of this important phenomenon has been hindered by its fragmented development in the literature. To address this shortcoming, we conduct a comprehensive review of BCA across a wide range of disciplines in management, including corporate political activity, private regulation, strategic management, and organizational institutionalism. Based on this review, we develop an integrative framework that identifies the triggers, outcomes, and internal political arrangements associated with BCA. In doing so, we help develop a common vocabulary that unites different market and non‐market forms of BCA, thus deepening our understanding of the role of business collective action in society.</content>

    <title>From Order to Chaos: How Consumers Lose Control of Risks (and of Themselves)</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers are exposed to a growing array of risks in an increasingly complex and uncertain world. Prior research has shown that they can navigate and even benefit from certain risks through edgework. However, the proliferation of credit and debt has led many into over-indebtedness—a dysfunctional condition in which control over risk is lost. This study examines the narratives and lived experiences of over-indebted consumers through the lens of chaos narratives. The downward trajectory begins with the initial motivation to access credit, followed by precipitating events and aggravating factors, ultimately leading to chaotic experiences. Adopting a sociocultural perspective, we explore how consumers misperceive risks and fail in their risk management efforts. We identify four dimensions that define consumers’ chaos narratives: emotional battering, unmaking the world, living on immediacy, and loss of consumption and threatened subsistence. As they transition from order to chaos, consumers encounter escalating risks that intensify in unforeseen and harmful ways. We describe this experience as spiraling down with escalating risks—a progressive, disorienting descent marked by compounding vulnerability. This process severely affects consumer identity and well-being, excluding over-indebted individuals from the consumption domain.</content>

    <title>Facilitating Mental Health Disclosure and Better Work Outcomes: The Role of Organizational Support for Disclosing Mental Health Concerns</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mental health concerns among employees are increasingly prevalent, yet many employees remain under‐supported. Disclosure is a critical step in accessing organizational support for mental health. Drawing on social information processing theory, we introduce the concept of organizational support for disclosing mental health concerns and develop a scale assessing three dimensions: absence of anticipated discrimination and stigma, availability of organizational resources, and presence of social support. Across two studies, we show that organizational support for disclosing mental health concerns is positively associated with employees' willingness to disclose and actual disclosure behaviors. Greater organizational support for disclosing mental health concerns is also linked to reduced mental health challenges (e.g., lower anxiety and depression) and improved work outcomes, including higher work engagement, job satisfaction, and organizational citizenship behavior, alongside lower turnover intentions and absenteeism. Our findings provide a framework for assessing employees' perceptions of disclosure support and offer practical insights for HR professionals seeking to foster disclosure‐friendly work environments. Finally, we contribute to the debate on mandatory disability reporting by identifying organizational factors that can enhance disclosure rates and improve support for employees with mental health concerns.</content>

    <title>From Policy to Practice: Unraveling Individual Uptake of Compressed Work Schedules</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Compressed work schedules, like full‐time 4‐day weeks, are widely advocated as promising work–life flexibility policies and attractive alternatives to female part‐time work. Yet, individual characteristics and implementation factors associated with policy use are understudied. Drawing from the literature on work–life flexibility policies and nonstandard work schedules, this study investigates which individual characteristics and implementation factors are associated with policy use. Our quantitative results reveal that employees with longer daily working hours are significantly more inclined to use the policy and view it as a source of increased autonomy. Our qualitative findings elucidate that overworking employees often use the policy to regulate their chronic overtime via additional days off. Moreover, our findings indicate limited policy use as an alternative to part‐time work and reveal that women transitioning from part‐time roles may face increased work–life conflict when using the policy. These findings highlight that the policy should not be advocated as a one‐size‐fits‐all solution and provide several implications for research and practice.</content>

    <title>Why Should Organizational Scholars Study Migration?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Migration is one of the most significant forces shaping economies and societies, yet it remains largely understudied in organizational research. At the same time, scholars in other fields with long traditions of studying migration tend to overlook the essential role of organizations. This lack of dialogue is striking because organizations are often the central arena in which migrants interact with others and through which they impact society and the economy. We explain how scholars of migration and organizations can benefit each other by exploring two broad issues. First, we consider what an organizational lens can add to the existing migration literature. We argue that organizational heterogeneity plays an essential role in determining the causes and effects of migration. Second, we consider how taking migration seriously can yield theoretical advancements for organizational scholars. We present examples that introduce potentially novel theoretical concepts or that enrich existing theories. Our aim is to broaden the research agenda for scholars interested in migration or organizations and to motivate organizational scholars to engage more deeply with one of the most consequential issues of our time.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We analyze the convergence rates of stochastic approximation algorithms under nonvanishing gradient conditions. For these sharp (V-shaped) functions, standard Gaussian approximations fail, making tighter exponential concentration bounds more suitable. We prove that stochastic approximation algorithms, including Projected Stochastic Gradient Descent (PSGD), Kiefer-Wolfowitz, and Frank-Wolfe algorithms, exhibit exponential concentration near an optimum. A consequence is faster convergence rates, notably linear convergence, and O(1/t) rates. The paper leverages techniques from Markov chain theory, specifically geometric ergodicity and Lyapunov drift analysis, thereby extending previous results by Hajek (1982) .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Joint Order Fulfillment and Inventory Management in Assemble-to-Order Generalized W SystemsDespite their prevalence and considerable benefits, assemble-to-order systems are notoriously difficult to analyze and manage. In the paper “Joint Order Fulfillment and Inventory Management in Assemble-to-Order Generalized W Systems,” Yu, Zheng, and Chen develop a strategy under which the policy for demand fulfillment is static nested and that for inventory procurement is of the newsvendor type. They show that the strategy is asymptotically optimal in the high-demand regime for assemble-to-order generalized W systems, in which k products are assembled from a common component and k product-specific components.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Optimizing Liner Shipping Network Design via Simultaneous Column- and Row-GenerationIn “A Simultaneous Column- and Row-Generation Solution Method for Liner Shipping Network Design,” Xia, Xu, and Baldacci tackle a challenging liner shipping network design problem, which involves complex rotation structures and interdependent decisions on rotation design, fleet deployment, and cargo routing. The authors propose a new exact solution method based on a simultaneous column- and row-generation framework with novel acceleration techniques, named the LP-based approach and postpricing phase. These techniques leverage dual information to avoid generating unnecessary columns, speeding up the convergence of the solution method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated for two variants of the liner shipping network design problem. Beyond maritime transportation, this work contributes to the broader field of mathematical programming by introducing an adaptable solution framework and speedup techniques for solving large-scale integer linear programs with column-dependent rows.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How to Efficiently Estimate Stability Measures: A Minimax Optimal ApproachIn “Minimax Optimal Estimation of Stability Under Distribution Shift,” Hongseok Namkoong, Yuanzhe Ma, and Peter W. Glynn address the challenge of benchmarking the performance of decision policies and prediction models under distribution shift. Conventional risk measures and distributionally robust losses typically require specifying the magnitude of possible distribution shift—a quantity that is difficult to determine in practice. Instead, the authors consider a stability measure defined in terms of the acceptable level of performance degradation, which is more intuitive. To efficiently estimate this measure, they consider an estimator based on the dual formulation of the stability measure and show that this estimator is minimax optimal. Their results quantify the convergence rate of the estimator, which exhibits a fundamental phase shift behavior. In addition, they empirically observe that the stability measure reliably captures system performance under distribution shift in applications including queueing systems and healthcare prediction tasks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We empirically examine the consequences of the introduction of a cap-and-trade program in California, showing that although the program helped reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it had the unintended consequence of increasing toxic emissions from treated facilities, as facilities cut back on their waste-treatment efforts to reduce GHG emissions. We further show that this effect was weaker for more harmful toxins, for facilities that had invested in reducing toxic waste at source, and for those that were subject to close scrutiny from regulators, consistent with it being the result of strategic firm actions.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: I gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Singapore Green Finance Centre to enable the dissemination of this research’s findings.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.03560 .</content>

    <title>On seeing the self as a scarce resource: How time and money scarcity differentially shape consumers' self‐value and preferences</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite the growing interest in studying the psychology of scarcity and its effect on consumers, little research has investigated whether the effect of resource scarcity depends on the type of scarce resource. Across six studies, we identify the distinct psychological and decision‐making consequences of two types of resource scarcity: time and money. We hypothesize that time and money scarcity can differentially influence consumer preferences by altering self‐perceptions. Time (vs. money) scarcity leads to perceiving the self as a scarce resource, and these self‐perceptions result in time‐ (vs. money‐) scarce consumers drawing more favorable assessments of self‐value and preferring options that reflect their heightened self‐value. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the differential effect of time versus money scarcity only holds for consumption choices reflecting self‐value. We also identify an important moderating condition: the source of the experience of scarcity, specifically whether it was self‐chosen or not.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article investigates how human resource (HR) practices affect organizational outcomes in one of the newest areas of service work: the gig economy. Combining theory on multi‐sided markets and strategic human resource management, this article explores how platform companies' use of HR practices can lead to improved worker retention. Specifically, we focus on one important aspect of retention: preventing workers from simultaneously working for a rival platform, a practice known asmulti‐homing. Drawing on original qualitative and quantitative data from the ride‐hail industry, we demonstrate that the introduction of HR practices reduces gig workers' tendency to multi‐home.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior research generally suggests that addressing shareholder interests may come at the expense of non‐shareholding stakeholders. Our study challenges this notion by examining how shareholder interests, alongside those of other stakeholders, may align with social issue engagement. Specifically, we explore the relationship between legitimacy challenges (i.e., shareholder activism and social disapproval) and firm strategies in social issue engagement. We find that shareholder activism is positively associated with the materiality of social issue engagement, reflecting a firm's relative emphasis on material social issues over immaterial ones. Conversely, social disapproval is negatively associated with such emphasis. Furthermore, these relationships vary with investor relations officer engagement, the presence of social welfare nonprofits, and SASB standards promulgation. Our findings contribute to the literature on legitimacy management and social issue engagement.Managerial SummaryManaging relationships with both shareholders and non‐shareholding stakeholders is complex amid a diverse landscape of social issues. Firms should be aware of the multifaceted nature of legitimacy challenges and tailor their response strategies accordingly. This study explores the challenges posed by shareholder activism and social disapproval, revealing that shareholder activism is positively related to a firm's relative emphasis on material social issues over immaterial ones, while social disapproval is negatively related to such emphasis. Furthermore, these dynamics are influenced by factors such as investor relations officer engagement, the presence of social welfare nonprofits, and the adoption of SASB standards. The study enhances the understanding of how firms navigate legitimacy challenges and strategically prioritize social issues to meet stakeholder expectations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While extant research has studied extensively the consequences of chief executive officer (CEO) succession, we explore the concept of family CEO mentoring (from a departing family CEO to a younger family leader) as a potential driver of post‐succession performance in family firms. Drawing on stewardship theory and using a data set of 1787 Italian firms experiencing a CEO succession over 14 years, we show that family CEO mentoring positively influences post‐succession financial performance. We then argue and empirically confirm that the performance benefit of family CEO mentoring is enhanced by the presence of nonfamily members on the board but is dampened by industry turbulence. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for research on CEO mentoring, CEO succession, and family business performance.Managerial SummaryTo thrive across generations, family firms need to navigate the many complexities of chief executive officer (CEO) succession. One way to overcome the challenge is to have a departing family leader who provides mentoring to the younger family leader. Our examination of 1787 Italian family firms that experienced CEO succession in the period 2003–2016 suggests that family CEO mentoring drives better post‐succession firm performance, especially when there is a high presence of nonfamily directors in the boardroom and when the firm operates in low‐volatility industries. This study enhances the understanding of CEO succession by integrating the role of family CEO mentoring as a driver of post‐succession financial performance.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Value-Partitioning of Sales Contribution in Business Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In business markets, sales from customers are often jointly determined by multiple roles, yet firms struggle to quantify individual contribution of each role and the synergies among them. This study applies a value-partitioning approach to separate the sales contributions of customer-focused outside (OS) representatives (reps) and operations-focused inside (IS) reps, and their synergistic effects. It leverages variations in OS–IS combinations to generate individual-level value-added metrics, as well as metrics for dyadic synergies. To address empirical challenges such as limited variations in OS–IS combinations, the study employs empirical Bayes estimation, which provides Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) estimates. An application using data from aFortune500 firm operating in business markets, reveals that the value added by OS reps, IS reps, and their interface have substantial and differential impacts on customer sales. Specifically, an increase of one standard deviation in the effect of OS, IS, or interface synergy improves customer sales by 17.8%, 11.6%, or 14.3%, respectively. Simulations demonstrate the superiority of empirical Bayes over fixed effects estimation in reducing bias, and that the value-added metrics are predictive of future customer sales. This research also illustrates how value-added metrics can be applied to evaluate the impact of sales programs on different sales roles.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Investors look to the language a firm uses for information that may not be available otherwise, especially in entrepreneurial settings. One aspect of language that is garnering greater attention in the management and other business literatures is vagueness. Vague language is often viewed negatively by audiences because of its association with greater uncertainty and potential to obscure negative information. However, some work in linguistics implies that the use of vague language can have positive impacts if the speaker understands the needs of the audience. This study explores the use of vague language and its relationship with investor interest as well as how it interacts with the skills of the entrepreneurial founding team. We hypothesize that, in general, investors are less interested in firms that use vague language, but the positive impacts of vague language become apparent when firm founders have human capital endowments associated with the effective use of language. Analyses based on data from a major start-up pitch competition provide evidence to support these hypotheses. Post hoc analyses explore potential mechanisms.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.16367 .</content>

    <title>Assuring the Crowd: The Role of Assurance in Securities Crowdfunding Success</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the role of CPA financial statement assurance in securities crowdfunding. Under SEC Regulation Crowdfunding, effective May 2016, early-stage private companies are permitted to conduct securities crowdfunding offerings—low-dollar securities offerings on Internet platforms—to a large number of investors. Using SEC filings and hand-collected data on the universe of offerings from 2016 to 2019, we examine the relation between CPA assurance and capital raised in the securities crowdfunding market. We fail to find evidence that issuers voluntarily seek higher levels of assurance, and we document high rates of noncompliance with the CPA assurance requirements. Our results suggest the on average positive association between CPA assurance and crowdfunding outcomes shown in prior research is explained by noncompliance with the Reg CF assurance requirements and is not driven by additional assurance. Overall, this study provides new insights of interest to crowdfunding issuers, investors, and regulators on the role of assurance in this nascent market of capital formation for startups.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03178 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Experts estimate 20 million electric vehicles will be on U.S. roads by 2030, and the majority (around 80%) of the electric vehicle drivers will use home charging. Many utilities are designing managed home charging programs to centrally manage charging times to reduce cost, avoid new and aggravated peaks and blackouts, and ensure grid stability. These managed home charging programs are either active, in which the utility continuously controls the charging while the vehicle is plugged in, or passive, in which the participants decide when to charge based on preannounced low-rate episodes. We study jointly designing and executing these active and passive programs. We present a program-design model, which produces a menu of the charging programs, tailored for each driver type, and a load-management model, which dynamically manages the load supply to each individual participant. The load-management model consists of a large number of nonhomogeneous participants, and it is a large-scale mixed-integer nonlinear stochastic problem. We present an effective approximation method, conduct thorough theoretical and numerical analyses of our approximation, and provide worst-case bounds for its error components. Our methodology provides detailed insights on the amount and timing of the improvements achievable in cost and demand variability by offering managed home charging programs, and by customizing the passive programs. It also offers detailed insights on the significance of the tradeoff between cost and demand variability. We find promoting a culture of charging electric vehicles every night may significantly increase utilities’ total cost if passive programs have high participation levels.This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00850 .</content>

    <title>Lemon Ads: Adverse Selection in Multichannel Display Advertising Markets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Two auction-based channels play a crucial role in facilitating transactions of ad impressions in display advertising: real-time bidding (RTB), which is accessible to all advertisers, and private marketplace (PMP), which is restricted to a select group of advertisers through invitation-based agreements with publishers. Despite the ongoing discourse on the benefits and drawbacks of these two channels, how their coexistence influences the market dynamics and outcomes remains an open question. In this paper, we investigate this question by focusing on the welfare implications of publishers’ channel adoption. First, using a game-theoretic model, we show that publishers who use both RTB and PMP can leverage their private information on impression quality to sell lower-quality impressions at higher prices in RTB, leading to adverse selection and exposing their RTB-only counterparts to losses. To validate our theoretical prediction, we conduct an empirical analysis using a large proprietary data set. The results provide strong evidence of the presence of adverse selection. In particular, we find that, all else being equal, RTB impressions from dual-channel publishers are of significantly lower quality compared with those from single-channel publishers. Our findings shed light on the nuanced dynamics between RTB and PMP and contribute to the understanding of the complex interplay of informational and strategic factors in the display advertising market.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03407 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A mixture of multinomial logits (mixed multinomial logit (MMNL)) generalizes the multinomial logit model, which is commonly used in modeling market demand to capture consumer heterogeneity. Although extensive algorithms have been developed in the literature to learn MMNL models, theoretical results are limited. Built on the Frank-Wolfe (FW) method, we propose a new algorithm that learns both mixture weights and component-specific logit parameters with provable convergence guarantees for an arbitrary number of mixtures. Our algorithm utilizes historical choice data to generate a set of candidate choice probability vectors, each being close to the ground truth with a high probability. We further provide a sample complexity analysis to show that only a polynomial number of samples is required to secure the performance guarantee of our algorithm. Finally, we apply the learned MMNL to data-driven multiproduct pricing problems and quantify how the estimation errors affect the pricing optimality under our proposed data-driven pricing framework Numerical studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.This paper was accepted by J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study optimal workforce and contract design for a firm that employs a team of two agents. The agents have possibly diverse demographic characteristics captured by their discount factors. When both agents have relatively low discount factors (impatient agents), the optimal contract is designed to foster cooperation, whereas when both agents have relatively high discount factors (patient agents), the optimal contract is designed to both foster cooperation and prevent collusion. In preventing collusion, the principal optimally targets the less patient agent by offering him higher-powered incentives, while the more patient agent is offered lower-powered incentives to promote cooperation. Offering high-powered incentives to the less patient agent, who is also less susceptible to collusion, makes it costlier for the more patient agent to bribe the less patient agent into colluding. The optimal workforce is a diverse one consisting of one agent with the highest discount factor and a second agent with a discount factor that is just low enough that both agents can be offered cooperative incentives without inviting collusion. We also study optimal team design for four agents with given discount factors—two with low discount factors and two with high discount factors—who are to be assigned to two teams and identify conditions under which diverse assignment is optimal.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: J.

    <title>EXPRESS: Units or Pounds? How Anchoring on Salient Price Information Influences Perceptions of Product Value</title>
    <updated>2025-04-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research investigates how price format (unit-based, “$1 each” vs. weight-based, “$2 per pound”) affects consumer perceptions of product value. When judging a product’s value, grocery shoppers might consider how much they will have to pay in exchange for how much product (e.g., in pounds) they are getting. This work finds that when making this determination, shoppers anchor on the nominal value (e.g., $1, $2) of the most visually salient price that is displayed to them. As a result of this anchoring bias, perceived value is worse (i.e., less attractive) for lower-weight products (e.g., weighing less than one pound) when the most visually salient price is weight-based rather than unit-based (e.g., for a½ lb. product:$2.00 per pound &lt; $1.00 each). In contrast, for higher-weight products (e.g., weighing more than one pound), weight-based pricing is perceived more favorably than unit-based pricing (e.g., for a2 lb. product:$2.00 per pound &gt; $4.00 each). The authors provide evidence for this price format effect in a series of six studies, including two field studies examining real purchase behavior and sales.</content>

    <title>How Violence Shapes Place: The Rise of Neo‐Authoritarianism in the Global Value Chain and the Emergence of an ‘Infernal Place’ in the Bangladesh Garment Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article examines how and to what extent violence has become a pivotal tool for conducting business in places integrated into the global value chain. It also explores the roles stakeholders play in silencing workers' resistance within these places. Drawing on an in‐depth case study of the Bangladeshi garment industry, this study reveals that both foreign and homegrown violence transform factory floors into infernal places where workers' rights, dignity, emotions, resistance, and even lives are systematically degraded by neo‐authoritarian stakeholders. Furthermore, it explores the ways in which a neo‐authoritarian regime, disguised as promoting economic growth and stability, normalizes violence in these places through constitutional reforms, amendments, or the revocation of legal frameworks. This study contributes to management research by uncovering place‐based violence and the roles of neo‐authoritarian alliances in enabling both organizational and social actors, as gatekeepers, to silence workers' resistance. It argues that without a fundamental shift toward anti‐authoritarian governance, dismantling these infernal places will remain an insurmountable challenge.</content>

    <title>What Makes Mothers Decide (Not) to Become Entrepreneurs? Unpacking the Role of Time and Money in Parental Leave Policies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Whether mothers become entrepreneurs after childbirth may depend on the generosity of the parental leave that they receive. We apply a resource perspective to disentangle the impact of the policy's time and money components on mothers' likelihood of becoming entrepreneurs. Against the common belief that generous parental leave discourages entrepreneurship, we suggest that offering more time and monetary resources through parental leave can promote mothers' entrepreneurship. In a natural experiment (n = 181 mother entrepreneurs from the German Socio‐Economic Panel), we find that a German time‐contractionary policy reform (2001) reduced the odds of mothers becoming self‐employed by 17 per cent. A subsequent money‐expansionary reform (2007) was unrelated to mothers' entrepreneurial entry. Our second study, a conjoint experiment (n = 2176 decisions nested within 136 women), confirms these findings, showing a significant effect for only the time but not the money component of parental leave on women's likelihood of self‐employment. We further explore boundary conditions that underscore nuanced effects of these policies depending on household burdens and socioeconomic context. We conclude that it is the time component of parental leave policies that matters most, while money affects the likelihood of becoming an entrepreneur only among mothers heavily burdened with household responsibilities.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a theory of banking in which banks cannot perfectly control deposit flows. Facing uninsurable loan and deposit shocks, banks dynamically manage lending, wholesale funding, deposits, and equity. Deposits create value by lowering funding costs. However, when the bank is undercapitalized and at risk of breaching leverage requirements, the marginal value of deposits can turn negative as deposit inflows, by raising leverage, increase the likelihood of costly equity issuance. Banks' inability to fully control leverage distinguishes them from nondepository intermediaries. Our model suggests a reevaluation of leverage regulations and offers new perspectives on banking in a low‐interest‐rate environment.</content>

    <title>Customizing your way to health: How self‐customization influences food choices</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Companies are increasingly adopting self‐customization, allowing customers to create personalized products. In the food and beverage industry, this is often provided at no extra cost. While most consumers believe that adding more options maximizes the benefit in self‐customization, which leads companies to adopt pay‐per‐add pricing models to manage costs, this logic does not always hold in food consumption. In this context, adding more can compromise health goals and diminish the taste experience. Across a field study conducted with a pizza restaurant that temporarily switched from a fixed à‐la‐carte menu to a self‐customization menu and two controlled experiments, we demonstrate that self‐customization in indulgent contexts leads to healthier choices—pizzas with fewer calories and fat calories—by enhancing a sense of autonomy. We further identify a boundary condition, where the positive effect of self‐customization diminishes in healthy contexts, such as when choosing a salad.</content>

    <title>Startup hiring through firm‐driven search: Evidence from Venture for America</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Due to their limited reputation as potential employers, startups struggle to generate interest (e.g., applications) from jobseekers. To help mitigate these frictions, employers can proactively reach out to jobseekers. In this study, we examine the relationship between firm‐driven search and startups' hiring and retention of young workers. Using a unique empirical setting, we find that firm‐driven search is associated with a higher likelihood of hiring. However, candidates sourced through firm‐driven search exhibit greater turnover rates. In exploring the underlying mechanisms, we find suggestive evidence that candidates perceive firm‐driven search as a favored substitute for their search efforts. For employers, startups with lower visibility and pronounced hiring needs are most likely to engage in firm‐driven search, implying that they do so despite the lower retention prospects.Managerial SummaryStartups often struggle to attract applicants due to limited visibility and reputation. This study examines “firm‐driven search,” where startups initiate contact with candidates, using data from Venture for America. We find that this proactive approach improves hiring outcomes but increases employee turnover. Why? Candidates are more likely to consider and accept inbound opportunities, which can result in weaker alignment with their interests or goals. Despite the retention risk, startups with urgent hiring needs or limited reputation often adopt this strategy because the immediate benefits outweigh the costs. The takeaway: firm‐driven search is a powerful but double‐edged tool. It helps less‐visible startups compete for talent—but may lead to higher churn. Founders should balance the short‐term gains in hiring against the long‐term costs of employee turnover.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the effects of going public using a unique panel of firms in 16 European countries for which we observe financial data before and after initial public offering (IPO) attempts. We compare completed and withdrawn IPO attempts. We instrument the decision to complete the IPO using prior market returns. After instrumenting, we isolate a positive causal effect of going public on profitability. We also find a post-IPO expansion in sales per employee, subsidiaries, and countries in which firms operate. Overall, our results are consistent with going public relaxing financial constraints and inducing a shift in strategy towards increased commercialization. (JEL G32)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper shows that high-skilled immigrants strategically increase their workplace efforts in response to identity-based career concerns that intensify following national conflicts between their countries of origin and host countries. Leveraging the rapid escalation of the U.S.–China conflict following the 2016 U.S. presidential election in the difference-in-differences framework, we show that Chinese-descent inventors in the United States significantly increased their workplace efforts compared with their Korean- and Japanese-descent counterparts. Consistent with our theory, this effect is more pronounced among Chinese-descent inventors more vulnerable to identity-based career concerns, including midcareer migrants, those with ethnically distinctive first names, corporate inventors more dependent on immigration sponsorship than academic counterparts, and those residing in counties with higher levels of Trump support. Furthermore, using a nationally representative survey, we find that Chinese-descent college-educated workers in the United States reported working significantly more hours than their Korean and Japanese counterparts following the conflict. This study contributes to our understanding of how high-skilled immigrants adjust their workplace efforts in response to geopolitical tensions.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.19031 .</content>

    <title>Big Shoes to Fill: How Star Search Behavior and Network Structure Influence Coinventor Mobility and Innovation Performance upon Star Exit</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A robust body of literature examines how star inventors influence their firms’ innovation trajectories, but how their departure affects firm innovation outcomes is imprecisely understood. Star departure has two kinds of spillover effects on firms: increased coinventor mobility and reduced coinventor performance. In this study, we aim to understand whether and why these spillover effects may systematically differ between stars. We argue that star search behavior influences the nature of embeddedness—positional and structural—in the star-coinventor network, which in turn differentially affects the two spillover effects arising from star exit. We test our hypotheses using patent data from 1985 to 2010 in the pharmaceutical industry. We find that when compared with the exit of an average star inventor, the exit of a broad-searcher star inventor is associated with a greater reduction in coinventor performance but not in coinventor mobility. In contrast, the exit of a deep-searcher star inventor is associated with an increase in coinventor mobility but has a smaller effect in reducing (remaining) coinventor performance than the departure of a broad-searcher star. We find that variation in the star’s collaboration network structure underlies these effects. Further, network structure has countervailing effects on coinventors’ mobility and (remaining) coinventors’ performance. This study helps better understand the human capital versus relational capital effects of inventor mobility.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2020.14415 .</content>

    <title>Meating Expectations: Category Legitimation and Transmutation</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates how market actors legitimize new categories that challenge the foundational understandings of established ones while simultaneously seeking to compete in the same market space. We analyze the development of the U.S. plant-based meat category from 2012 to 2019, focusing on how plant-based meat producers positioned their products as legitimate competitors within the meat category despite their nonanimal origins. We identify three key legitimation strategies used by entrepreneurs: reconfiguring the category basis by reframing the core attributes of meat from animal origin to shared biochemical components; creating experiential congruence by replicating the sensory qualities and social practices associated with traditional meat; and instilling value superiority by emphasizing health, environmental, and ethical benefits along with forward-thinking innovation. Our observations also lead us to theorize what we term category transmutation—a construct for understanding how the successful legitimation of a new category might reshape the meaning and boundaries of an existing one. We envision category transmutation as a process through which an existing category evolves to incorporate both traditional and new subcategories, thereby vertically modifying the category structure. This study advances our understanding of category dynamics and extends the role of cultural entrepreneurship beyond gaining legitimacy to reshaping category systems and market structures, with the potential to drive positive societal changes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study mixed-integer programming formulations for the piecewise linear lower and upper bounds (in other words, piecewise linear relaxations) of nonlinear functions that can be modeled by a new class of combinatorial disjunctive constraints (CDCs), generalized nD-ordered CDCs. We first introduce a general formulation technique to model piecewise linear lower and upper bounds of univariate nonlinear functions concurrently so that it uses fewer binary variables than modeling bounds separately. Next, we propose logarithmically sized ideal nonextended formulations to model the piecewise linear relaxations of univariate and higher-dimensional nonlinear functions under the CDC and independent branching frameworks. We also perform computational experiments for the approaches modeling the piecewise linear relaxations of nonlinear functions and show significant speed-ups of our proposed formulations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that piecewise linear relaxations can provide strong dual bounds of the original problems with less computational time by an order of magnitude.Funding: This work was supported by the Office of Naval Research [Grant N000142412648], for Rice University.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2023.0187 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Professions continue to be central to understanding organizing in the 21st century. The literature on professions is segmented into theoretical conversations that offer different conceptualizations of professions and theoretical concerns. Through an analysis of the literature, we unpack four lanes – teleological, institutional, ecological, and cultural – that co‐exist to make up the literature on professions. We synthesize the theoretical conversations generated within each lane, identify key distinctions across lanes, and assess the future potential of each lane, noting where there is space for contribution. Beyond making the dominant paradigms, their plurality, and their central distinctions recognizable, we encourage researchers to move beyond studying professionsquaprofessions to articulate the role and impact of professions in organizations and society. We offer seven proposals for enlivening the research agenda on professions, including prioritizing real‐world problems and outcomes over paradigmatic perspectives.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crowdfunding is a relatively nascent, rapidly growing phenomenon whereby individuals or ventures pursue funding from a potentially large number of backers via the Internet. This rapidly emerging literature invites a variety of conceptual lenses and offers significant potential to advance theoretical understanding of important organizational activities, such as how entrepreneurs and organizations are evaluated by external stakeholders or how the crowdfunding process shapes the strategic decisions of emerging organizations. Our integrative review seeks to discover how the extant body of crowdfunding research challenges, extends, and contributes to the theoretical understanding of management and organizational phenomena and how these insights might drive further theoretical advancement. To do so, we inductively identify ten dominant topics that span the crowdfunding landscape across disciplines (268 articles) and synthesize the major findings within each topic based on relevant theoretical concepts. In doing so, we highlight how each topic area has applied and advanced various organizational theories. We then leverage the ten topics to articulate opportunities for future research uncovered by our review that provide potential contributions to theories germane to the management literature and to guide the next decade of crowdfunding research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the primary article of this research dialogue (Journal of Consumer Psychology, 2025), we outlined the social, cognitive, and affective benefits of interacting with nature and briefly discussed the relevance of this work to consumer psychology. In their commentary to our primary article, Haws and Yamim approached nature purely within the marketplace setting and discussed how consumer exposure to natural elements may activate semantic networks that will predictably influence consumer behavior. We contextualized the current response to this commentary under the umbrella of sustainability and sustainable consumer decisions. First, we clarify attention restoration theory, stress reduction theory, and assumptions regarding the preference for nature. Second, we discuss definitions of nature from an interdisciplinary perspective. Building upon this, we speak to the potential semantic activations suggested by Haws and Yamim in response to nature exposure, probing potential individual and group‐level variations and the relevance of these differences in the consumer space. Finally, we discuss potential conflicts of utilizing nature in the marketplace embedded within the perspective of sustainability goals. In this sense, we question the consequences and ethical considerations of employing nature as a mechanism to influence consumer behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Rim, Schertz, and Berman (Journal of Consumer Psychology, 2025) present prior research examining the affective, cognitive, and social benefits of humans' interactions with nature. In doing so, they offer some specific applications to consumer psychology and encourage more research examining the consequences of nature interaction on consumer behaviors. We build on this important work by considering the breadth of potential forms of interaction between consumers and nature in both indoor and outdoor spaces as well as in real and virtual (i.e., representations of) nature exposures. We build on semantic activation and goal‐systems theory to elaborate further on how nature can influence consumers. Specifically, associations elicited by nature can activate or enhance the importance of certain goals during the consumption process, thus driving consumers' judgments and decision‐making. We elaborate on how nature can be specifically applied to the place, product, and promotion elements of the marketing mix and how future research can examine the consequences of nature interactions on consumer behavior.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The surrounding environment influences how people feel, think, and behave. This effect is apparent when examining the multitude of ways interactions with natural environments impact people psychologically. In this Research Dialogue, we discuss work by ourselves and others that demonstrate the benefits of spending time in nature or interacting with natural stimuli, across three psychological domains. First, we discuss affective benefits, such as improved mood and decreased stress and rumination. Then, we discuss cognitive benefits, such as improved working memory. Lastly, we discuss social benefits, such as prosocial and proenvironmental attitudes. We introduce several environmental psychology theories that try to explain why these benefits occur. We present our own work that attempts to determine what characteristics of natural environments cause or are related to these effects by quantifying distinguishing characteristics of natural versus built environments along a variety of dimensions. We then investigate how these dimensions influence the psychological experience in a more natural versus a more built environment. We end by outlining the implications of the benefits of interacting with nature in influencing consumer behaviors.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can algorithms help people detect deception in high-stakes strategic interactions? Participants watching the preplay communication of contestants in the TV show Golden Balls display a limited ability to predict contestants’ behavior, whereas algorithms do significantly better. To increase participants’ accuracy, we provide them with algorithmic advice by flagging videos for which an algorithm predicts a high likelihood of cooperation or defection. We test how the effectiveness of flags depends on their timing. We show that participants rely significantly more on flags shown before they watch the videos than flags shown after they watch them. These findings show that the timing of algorithmic feedback is key for its adoption.This paper was accepted by Marie-Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: Funding provided by an Innovation Grant for Inclusive Research Excellence at UC San Diego.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02792 .</content>

    <title>Employee Mobility Barriers: An Integrative Review Across Careers, Human Resources, and Strategic Management Research</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The ability of employees to move between firms of their own volition is a defining characteristic that distinguishes human capital from other resources. This review bridges previously isolated research communities by synthesizing knowledge on “employee mobility barriers”—mechanisms that restrict employee movement and help firms maintain human capital-based competitive advantages. We introduce a typology of ten categories of employee mobility barriers, differentiated by level of analysis (individual, organizational, societal) and degree of firm control, to organize the disparate literature on this topic. Building on this foundation, we propose an architecture of strategic modes that characterizes firm responses to employee mobility barriers based on the level of firm control (high vs. low) and the level at which barriers operate (individual vs. organizational). This framework offers a theoretical lens for understanding how firms navigate these barriers through proactive and reactive strategies, highlighting implications for decision-making, centralization, and delegation. Our review examines the dual nature of employee mobility as both an opportunity and a challenge for firms and individuals, with implications across three primary domains: individual careers, human capital/human resource management (HC/HRM), and strategic management. We propose a portfolio perspective for future research to explore whether different mobility barriers act as complements or substitutes. Additionally, we consider the relational benefits of employee mobility and suggest directions for further inquiry. By integrating our typology and the architecture of strategic modes, this review advances theoretical and practical understanding of employee mobility barriers, reflecting recent developments and setting the stage for future research.</content>

We capture uninformed volume using spikes in retail trading triggered by weekly advertisements (ads) in theWall Street Journalthat are largely duplicates. We report three findings. First, consistent with a positive volume-volatility relation, stock price volatility amplifies on recurring ad days. Second, informed investors time liquidity to trade more aggressively on recurring ad days. Third, despite the increase in informed trading on such days, price impact is lower, yielding a negative volume–price impact relation. Collectively, the evidence supports the theoretical predictions of Collin-Dufresne and Fos (2016).</content>

    <title>How to Sustain Sustainable Practices? The Journey Toward Zero Waste Lifestyle</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sustaining sustainable practices in a market whose infrastructure continues to prioritize unsustainable options is not easy. It is even more difficult when living sustainably involves interwoven practices that are embedded and connected together. We focus on one such system of sustainable practices and explore consumers’ journey toward Zero Waste lifestyle, a system of practices not yet institutionalized. Using a qualitative multimethod study and a practice theoretical lens, this research uncovers the iterative process through which this system of practices develops around the Zero Waste meta-meaning, a driving force common to all practices. Our analyses reveal a set of adaptive capabilities that allow carriers of practices to gradually grow and stabilize the system of interwoven practices that scaffold the Zero Waste lifestyle. The institutionalization of the system of practices requires a mutualization of capabilities amongst carriers who hold a common meta-meaning. This mutually reinforcing process and reciprocity enables the gradual institutionalization of the system of practices. By approaching the maintenance of sustainable practices with a practice theoretical lens, this research offers new ways to encourage and promote the transition toward more sustainable lifestyles.</content>

    <title>Haptic Rewards: How Mobile Vibrations Shape Reward Response and Consumer Choice</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;People spend a large portion of their day interacting with vibrating mobile devices, yet how consumers psychologically respond to haptic feedback from these devices and their effect on consumer decision-making is largely unknown. Integrating recent work on human-computer interaction and reward processing, the current research examines: (1) the relationship between vibration duration and reward response, (2) to what extent rewarding vibrations influence consumer choice, (3) the process by which this effect occurs, and (4) how the effect differs compared to other forms of feedback (visual and audio). We find that mobile vibrations evoke a reward response that is distinct from other forms of feedback, which in turn boosts purchasing in online shopping environments (increased item adds and higher basket totals), and that impulsive consumers tend to be more responsive to mobile vibrations. We examine the impact of mobile vibrations on consumer decision-making in a variety of experimental settings, drawing on a diverse participant pool, leveraging both controlled experiments, and a country-wide field experiment to assess important boundary conditions. These findings have important implications for the ethical design of haptic interfaces in the marketplace and the role of mobile vibrations as a novel form of reward.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The paper examines the decision‐making, compensation, and turnover of female CEOs in U.S. hospitals. Contrary to the literature on lower‐ranked executives and directors in public firms, there is no evidence that gender differences in preferences for risk or altruism affect decision‐making of hospital CEOs: corporate policies do not shift when women take (or leave) office, and male and female CEOs respond similarly to a major financial shock. However, female CEOs earn lower salaries, face flatter pay‐for‐performance incentives, and exhibit greater turnover after poor performance. Hospital boards behave as though they perceive female CEOs as less productive.</content>

    <title>The Color of Status: Color Saturation, Brand Heritage, and Perceived Status of Luxury Brands</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The elevation of brand status is a crucial goal for numerous luxury brands. Building on the framework of learned color associations, the current research suggests that using less saturated colors in products enhances consumers’ perception of luxury brand status. This effect arises from consumers’ association between less saturated colors and the passage of time, leading to perceptions of the brand as having a rich continuity heritage. Because continuity heritage confers a higher status on a luxury brand, consumers subsequently perceive the brand as having elevated status. Through seven experimental and field studies, we empirically demonstrate that low (vs. high) color saturation increases a luxury brand’s perceived brand status, with perceived continuity heritage mediating this effect. However, this effect is mitigated when the brand highlights its recent (vs. old) foundation years and is even reversed when the brand positions itself as innovative. Additionally, we show that color saturation can affect consumers’ willingness to pay and product choices. This work contributes to the literature on luxury branding, brand heritage, and color while offering valuable insights for luxury brand managers on effectively enhancing their brand’s perceived status.</content>

    <title>Does Using a Pink Product Increase Men’s Support for Women? How Product Usage Influences Perspective-Taking</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Integrating insights from several different theoretical perspectives, this research formulates and tests a conceptualization of how men’s use of products containing features stereotypically associated with women (e.g., pink-colored products) induces them to become more supportive of women. This effect is held to arise because men’s use of pink products leads them to have an experience similar to the one associated with women, encouraging male users to adopt the perspective of women. In turn, this perspective-taking increases their willingness to engage in behaviors supportive of women. Across six studies, we found that when men used pink-colored products (e.g., pens, headphones, folders), they subsequently showed greater support for women, such as writing supportive messages, sharing information about gender equality, donating money, and volunteering. However, this effect diminished when men merely saw the pink products rather than used them, when their gender identity was threatened, or when the support target was not women. We also discussed the implications of these findings.</content>

    <title>A Meta‐Analysis of Employee &lt;scp&gt;HR&lt;/scp&gt; Attributions and Their Relationships With Employee‐Perceived High‐Performance Work Systems and Employee Outcomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Research on HR attributions has received a considerable amount of attention in the study of employee perceptions of human resource management (HRM). This increased attention is based on the premise that employee attributions aboutwhycertain HR practices are implemented significantly influence employee outcomes. In this study, we review and meta‐analytically examine the relationships between two major types of HR attributions (i.e., commitment‐ and control‐focused) and various employee outcomes (i.e., employee vitality and engagement, work attitudes, and job performance). We also test several boundary conditions (e.g., the target of HR attributions) that may influence these relationships using multi‐level meta‐regression analysis. In addition, we meta‐analytically examine the relationships between two major HR attributions and their key antecedent—employee‐perceived high‐performance work systems (HPWS). Using the meta‐analytic data, we perform a path analysis to test a theory‐driven model that links employee‐perceived HPWS to commitment‐focused and control‐focused HR attributions and, ultimately, employee outcomes. We then conduct a general dominance analysis to compare the relative importance of employee‐perceived HPWS and the two types of HR attributions. As a supplementary analysis, we meta‐analyze the impact of demographic variables in shaping commitment‐ and control‐focused HR attributions. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and empirical implications of our findings, along with future research directions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We document political sentiment effects on U.S. inventors. Democratic inventors are more likely to patent (relative to Republicans) after the 2008 election of Obama but less likely after the 2016 election of Trump. These effects are at least twice as strong among politically active Democrats and are present even within firms and within firm×technology. We also show that partisans tend to cluster in technologies (e.g., Democrats in Biotechnology and Republicans in Weapons), so that sentiment effects aggregate to more patents in the technologies dominated by the winning party.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study collusion among firms against imperfectly monitored environmental regulation. Firms increase variable profits by violating regulation and reduce expected noncompliance penalties by violating jointly. We consider a case of three German automakers colluding to reduce the effectiveness of emissions control technology. By estimating a structural model of the European automobile industry from 2007 to 2018, we find that collusion lowers expected noncompliance penalties substantially and increases buyer and producer surplus. Due to increased pollution, welfare decreases by €1.57–5.57 billion. We show how environmental policy design and antitrust play complementary roles in preventing noncompliance.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this IssueHow to allocate limited resources when people compete for them?Data-driven decision rules are increasingly used to allocate limited resources. However, in domains such as college admissions and job hiring, these policies can be gamed and may perform poorly when people can strategically change their behavior and compete for the resource. Given a fixed selection criterion for scoring individuals, competition causes the threshold for receiving the resource to oscillate and change over time. As a concrete example, the median SAT score of an accepted student at a university can evolve over time because of competition. In “Policy Learning with Competing Agents,” Stanford researchers Roshni Sahoo and Stefan Wager demonstrate that this process can stabilize and reach an equilibrium. They develop an algorithm based on a local experimentation scheme to learn data-driven decision rules that maximize social welfare in the presence of competition.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using gender to identify analyst groups, we examine whether in-group bias affects the behavior of sell-side equity analysts and the information dissemination process. We find that analysts hold more optimistic and less accurate earnings expectations for firms with same-gender CEOs, where in-group bias is stronger among men. Greater exposure to out-of-group individuals weakens in-group bias, and the bias is also weaker among analysts located in U.S. states with greater gender equality. Group definitions based on race/ethnicity and name similarity yield similar results. These findings are robust and unlikely to reflect selective information access or various selection effects.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01467 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Lending relationships matter for firm financing. In a model of debt dynamics, we study how lending relationships are formed and how they impact the joint choice of leverage and debt maturity, thereby rationalizing recent empirical findings and generating new predictions. In the model, lending relationships evolve through repeated interactions between firms and debt investors. Stronger lending relationships lead firms to adopt higher leverage ratios, issue longer term debt, and raise funds from nonrelationship lenders via syndicated loans or bonds issues when relationship quality is sufficiently high. Debt contracts involving nonrelationship investors have longer maturity than those exclusively issued to relationship investors.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Funding: This work was supported by the Swiss Finance Institute, the Danish Finance Institute, and the Center for Financial Frictions [Grant DNRF102].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02415 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a controlled laboratory experiment, we examine how financial reporting regulations—limits on earnings management and auditing—affect disclosure quality and market efficiency. Our findings indicate that a tight limit and the possibility of an audit enhance the informativeness of earnings disclosures, leading to improved pricing efficiency while a weak limit deteriorates disclosure quality and pricing efficiency. Financial reporting regulations enhance disclosure quality via both constraining earnings management practices and inducing signaling behavior. Auditing more effectively boosts social welfare by suppressing manipulation, whereas limits trigger overinvestment in costly signal. Our results also shed light on previously contradictory empirical findings regarding financial reporting regulations.This paper was accepted by Marie Claire Villeval, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: Y.

    <title>Behind Emerging Market Firms’ Internationalization, Diversification, and Innovation: A Geographic Relational Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The internationalization of emerging market firms (EMFs) has attracted substantial research attention. Yet, how EMFs engage in diversification and innovation during internationalization remains underexplored. Drawing insights from a geographic relational perspective, we perform a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) on a sample of EMFs. Our findings suggest that EMFs can choose from multiple equifinal internationalization pathways to capture growth opportunities in diversification and/or innovation. These new insights emphasize that achieving diversification or innovation requires a combination of organizational contextuality, international path dependence, and geographic practice attributes. We further develop a taxonomy of five EMFs’ geographic relational configurations for diversification and/or innovation: entrenching specialist, niche explorer, global adapter, transnational agent, and strategic aspirant. Overall, by unleashing the power of configurational analysis, this paper reveals what is behind the intriguing internationalization of EMFs with a focus on diversification and innovation.</content>

    <title>Mitigating ingroup bias in regulatory firms: The role of inspector professionalism</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article adopts the lens of ingroup bias to study why regulatory firms tasked with enforcing regulatory compliance may underperform in their duties. We theorize that ingroup bias can lead regulatory agents to grant unwarranted trust to ingroup clients with whom they share salient characteristics, resulting in less stringent inspections for these clients compared to outgroup clients. We further examine how this effect is moderated by inspectors' professionalism, a human capital dimension reflecting an individual's engagement with their profession and internalization of its norms and standards. Using a difference‐in‐differences approach on micro‐data tracking 86 inspectors across 24,650 inspections of 462 vessels at a marine inspection firm, we find compelling evidence of ingroup bias and show that inspectors' professionalism mitigates its impact on regulatory enforcement stringency.</content>

    <title>Measuring Misreporting Incentives and Severity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose an empirical measure of the types of financial misreporting based on misreporting incentives. We identify three distinct types: (1) misreporting driven by top executives’ wealth pursuits, (2) misreporting induced by capital market pressure, and (3) misreporting by subordinates due to inadequate management oversight. Our measure is developed by conducting a detailed analysis of the textual data from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases. We also provide rigorous empirical validations. Additionally, we create a composite misreporting severity score that incorporates the three misreporting incentives. Using our measure of misreporting incentives, we help reconcile previous mixed findings on the link between equity incentives and financial misreporting. Furthermore, in predicting market reactions to misreporting, our misreporting severity score outperforms a measurement that does not integrate misreporting incentives. Our measures can be practical tools for investigating a wide range of research questions related to the causes and consequences of financial misreporting.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: This work was supported by the Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1 [Grants RG101/22 and RG59/17].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.00160 .</content>

    <title>From the Boardroom to the Jobsite: Female Board Representation and Workplace Safety</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Contributing to emerging research on corporate governance and operations management, our study examines the connection between board diversity and workplace safety. We propose that boards with a higher representation of female directors prioritize and thus enhance workplace safety due to women's distinct social‐cognitive perspectives on stakeholders, risk avoidance, and regulatory compliance. We also consider two conditions that may strengthen the relationship between female board representation and workplace safety: (1) the power of the female directors on the board, which may cause them to speak out more, and cause others to heed their perspectives; (2) accountability pressures faced by the board, which may increase board member epistemological motivation (the willingness to invest effort to fully understand the board's tasks and decisions being made). Analyzing a unique dataset that covers 1442 firm‐year observations across 266 firms, we show that female board representation improves workplace safety when women have more power and when boards face greater accountability pressures. In an empirical extension, we examine how the representation of racial/ethnic minority directors impacts workplace safety and the synergistic effect of female and minority board representation. Our findings deepen our understanding of how board diversity interacts with situational factors to influence operational outcomes.</content>

    <title>Contending with Perceived Legitimacy Tensions: Impact Investing in Pluralistic Institutional Environments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study advances our understanding of new venture legitimacy and resource acquisition by broadening the epistemological scope of our theory to be inclusive of non‐Western contexts. We conducted a qualitative study of entrepreneurs from India, Kenya, and Mexico seeking impact investments from Western impact investors to better understand how entrepreneurs in non‐Western contexts contend with perceived legitimacy tensions that arise when pursuing financial resources from non‐local investors. In contrast to the prevailing assumption that non‐Western entrepreneurs are resource‐constrained and adhere to existing strategies to seek legitimacy from financial resource providers, we find that such entrepreneurs perceive their local institutional environment to have important non‐financial resources that impact how they seek legitimacy from financial resource providers. This study offers a novel conceptualization of new venture legitimation by acknowledging non‐Western and Western institutional environments as important considerations in how entrepreneurs navigate legitimacy with both financial and non‐financial audiences over time.</content>

    <title>International contraction for the sake of international expansion</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We present novel theoretical arguments suggesting that the contraction of international market presence does not only allow firms to expand their presence into new business domains, but also to resume their international market presence in the long term. We argue that when firms contract their international market presence, they spark two subsequent processes: First, they free up non‐scale free financial resources that become available for expanding into new business domains. Subsequently, such expansion creates new scale free technological knowledge resources that facilitate renewed international expansion. We find support for the existence of this novel growth trajectory in an analysis of changes in the international market presence and business segment presence of an extensive sample of public US‐based firms between 1997 and 2019.Managerial SummaryPolitical frictions, economic crises, and pandemics in the wake of the 21st century have led to volatility in the international presence of firms. In this article, we argue and show that firms that contract their international market presence can use scarce financial resources that are freed up due to such contraction to expand their business scope. In turn, business scope expansion allows these firms to create new technological knowledge resources that support resumed international expansion. Generalizing this phenomenon, we argue that, in an age where firms need to navigate international contraction and expansion, contracting international presence in the short term does not only allow the expansion of business domains but also supports the expansion of international presence in the long term. Studying an extensive sample of public US‐based firms between 1997 and 2019 lends support to this view.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Because invention activities involve accessing, identifying, and recombining relevant prior art, startups confront significant search cost and effort. Using Google Patents's 2006 digitization of inventive records as a natural experiment, we examine how digitization affects the directionality and nature of entrepreneurial innovation. We analyze 17,664 US‐based startups in the life sciences industry and find that digitization increases the quantity and quality of prior art used as innovation inputs and those of patent applications generated as innovation outputs. Moreover, our findings indicate that digitization enables startups to transcend local searches for relevant inputs and increase both their entry into new technological domains and output utility. Our study sheds new light on how digitization and its search functionalities reshape startup innovation in the digital era.Managerial SummaryGoogle Patents's 2006 digitization of inventive records transformed entrepreneurial innovation in the US Analyzing 17,664 life sciences startups, we find that digitization enhances search efficiency by alleviating constraints in accessing knowledge while boosting search effectiveness by improving inventive experimentation as online search features make identifying and utilizing relevant external knowledge timelier and more precise. Digitization enables startups to utilize greater volume, higher quality, and more diverse knowledge from prior art while also reinforcing invention outcomes, expanding into new technological domains, and generating more impactful inventions. This study highlights how digitization democratizes access to knowledge and improves search effectiveness and entrepreneurial experimentation, ultimately transforming the startup innovation landscape. Overall, digitization disproportionately benefits startups in areas geographically remote from physical knowledge repositories.</content>

    <title>How digital platforms affect local entrepreneurial activities: Evidence from the staggered entry of craigslist</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Access to markets is critical for entrepreneurial success, yet many face significant barriers. This study argues that digital platforms functioning as peer‐to‐peer marketplaces can facilitate entrepreneurial activity by improving market access for new ventures. Using the staggered entry of Craigslist into various markets, we find that Craigslist's entry increased local entrepreneurial activities, especially in low‐income regions. Moreover, individuals from lower‐income households, as well as Black and immigrant communities, were more likely to create new ventures following Craigslist's entry. Firms founded after Craigslist's entry were also smaller in size, potentially reflecting more efficient management, and primarily operated in B2C rather than B2B sectors. This study highlights how multisided platforms can empower individuals with limited market access and resources, ultimately democratizing entrepreneurship in the digital age.Managerial SummaryAccess to markets is essential for entrepreneurs to succeed, yet many face significant challenges in starting and growing their businesses. This study demonstrates how digital platforms like Craigslist can help overcome these barriers and create opportunities for more people to participate in entrepreneurship. When Craigslist expanded to new locations, it increased small business activity, particularly in low‐income areas. Individuals from lower‐income households, as well as Black and immigrant communities, were especially likely to benefit from it when starting businesses. These businesses were smaller in size, potentially indicating more efficient management and more B2C‐focused operations. This research underscores how digital platforms can make markets more accessible for traditionally disadvantaged groups, fostering a more inclusive entrepreneurial ecosystem.</content>

    <title>Political Districting to Optimize the Polsby-Popper Compactness Score with Application to Voting Rights</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When drawing political districts, important criteria include district compactness and the ability of minority groups to convert votes into seats. In litigation, compactness is usually measured via the Polsby-Popper score; however, this score has largely been absent from the operations research literature, presumably because of its nonlinear nature. In “Political Districting to Optimize the Polsby-Popper Compactness Score with Application to Voting Rights,” Belotti, Buchanan, and Ezazipour propose new mixed-integer second-order cone programs (MISOCPs) to optimize this score, enabling them to find optimally compact districts built from voting precincts. The methods are extended to find compact plans with many majority-minority districts. This is the task faced by plaintiffs in lawsuits brought under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 who must show that an alternative plan exists in which the minority group could achieve better representation. Computational experiments show that the MISCOP-based methods perform as well (or better) than state-of-the-art approaches for this task, scaling to instances with nearly 200,000 census blocks.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How Online Retailers Can Fulfill Orders Faster and Cheaper in Structured RDC–FDC NetworksThe global surge in online shopping has driven e-retailers to rapidly expand their warehouse networks for faster deliveries. However, this has significantly increased fulfillment costs. In the paper “Multi-item Online Order Fulfillment in a Two-Layer Network,” Zhao, Wang, and Xin explore efficient ways to reduce these costs by examining how orders are allocated among warehouses in real time. They analyze a simple “myopic” algorithm, where each order is assigned immediately to the cheapest available warehouse without considering future orders. Surprisingly, this straightforward algorithm proves effective in structured warehouse networks consisting of larger regional distribution centers (RDCs) and smaller front distribution centers (FDCs), like those operated by JD.com . This contrasts sharply with more flexible fulfillment networks such as Amazon’s, where myopic algorithms usually underperform because of more complex fulfillment options requiring more advanced real-time algorithms. The key takeaway for businesses facing uncertain demand is that a less flexible fulfillment network—such as one consisting of large RDCs and smaller FDCs—enables simple and effective allocation methods.</content>

    <title>Robustly Optimal Contracts for Agricultural Supply Chains</title>
    <updated>2025-04-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Because of various factors (such as a lack of adequate statistical knowledge or data, unforeseen weather events), the yields of agricultural products often exhibit a high level of ambiguity. When facing distributional ambiguity in yields, farmers and landowners may base their contracting decisions on descriptive statistics, such as the mean and variance. To investigate how limited information could reshape optimal contract forms, we consider an agricultural supply chain in which a landowner contributes farmland and a skilled farmer exerts costly private effort to cultivate a crop. Both parties face distributional ambiguity in crop yield and employ a robust max-min decision rule. When the landowner possesses the bargaining power to draft the contract (the L model), we find that a hybrid contract of debt and equity is robustly optimal. In contrast, when the farmer possesses the bargaining power (the F model), the optimal contract could be a linear (equity) contract or a nonlinear quadratic debt contract, depending on the coefficient of variation (CV) and the landowner’s reservation profit. We use U.S. Department of Agriculture data to calibrate the model and find that, as the CV increases, the party that possesses the bargaining power tends to share more risk. We also find that when both the CV and the landowner’s reservation profit are sufficiently large, the L model induces a higher effort level; otherwise, the F model achieves better effort. Finally, we extend the model to consider various features, such as random crop price, farmer’s risk aversion and bounded crop yield.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.Funding: G.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study whether and how standardized gender diversity disclosure requirements affect women’s representation on corporate boards. Our analysis takes advantage of Canada’s 2014 regulation, which requires disclosures of consistent and comparable information on boards’ gender diversity policies and guidelines. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the disclosure regulation increases women’s representation on boards. The increase is more pronounced among firms with stronger shareholder oversight as proxied by ownership from environmental, social, and governance (ESG)–friendly investors, poor diversity performance preregulation, Toronto Stock Exchange index membership, and U.S. cross-listing. In addition, after the regulation, firms that make stronger diversity commitments (e.g., disclosing the adoption of written diversity policies and diversity targets) experience a higher increase in ownership by foreign ESG-friendly investors. Together, our findings suggest that standardized disclosure requirements enable shareholders to be better monitors, thereby improving board gender balance.This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00509 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Insufficient effort responding (IER) presents a significant challenge in management research, potentially leading to flawed inferences. This review critically examines IER practices in 17 leading management journals from 2012 to 2023, highlighting inconsistencies in screening methods, cutoffs, and reporting. We find that IER screening is more prevalent in studies using online paid samples, experimental tasks, and computerized data collection. However, researchers’ IER-related practices, specifically the use of multiple detection methods, predicted IER removal rate above and beyond these study characteristics. Our review revealed that, despite increasing awareness, IER detection and reporting remain unstandardized, with varied practices across studies. While attention checks are frequently used, details about their implementation are often inadequately reported, and multiple detection methods, though recommended, are inconsistently applied. Variability in cutoffs and reliance on single-item checks raise concerns about the risk of retaining IER cases or mistakenly excluding attentive respondents. Our assessment of the impact of IER removal suggests that while it generally improves reliability and model fit, its effect can vary widely across measures and studies. We call on methodologists to resolve existing inconsistencies by developing clearer, empirically derived guidelines for IER detection and removal. We urge researchers to adopt more comprehensive and transparent reporting practices to enhance replicability and methodological rigor, with a flowchart to guide research design and method communication. This review underscores the need for a more systematic approach to IER mitigation in management research to enhance data quality and research validity.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Economists often measure discrimination as disparities arising from the direct effects of group identity. We develop new tools to model and measure systemic discrimination, capturing how discrimination in other decisions indirectly contributes to disparities. A novel experimental design, the Iterated Audit, identifies systemic discrimination. We then illustrate these new tools in two field experiments. The first experiment shows how racial discrimination can accumulate across multiple rounds of hiring through the interaction of two forces: greater discrimination against inexperienced workers, which affects the opportunity to obtain experience, and high subsequent returns to experience. The second experiment shows how gender-based differences in the language of recommendation letters can translate into systemic gender discrimination in STEM hiring. We discuss how our findings qualify previous results on direct discrimination and how our tools can be used to target policy interventions.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide a new foundation of risk aversion by showing that this attitude is fully captured by the propensity to seize insurance opportunities. In our main results, we first characterize Arrow-Pratt (1963–1964) risk aversion in terms of propensity to full insurance and the stronger notion of risk aversion of Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970) in terms of propensity to partial insurance. We then extend the analysis to comparative risk aversion by showing that the classical notion of Yaari (1969) corresponds to comparative propensity to full insurance, while the stronger notion of Ross (1981) corresponds to comparative propensity to partial insurance.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide the first evidence on how workers invest in human capital after losing ability. Using quasi-random work accidents in Danish administrative data, we find that workers enroll in bachelor’s programs after physical injuries, pursuing degrees that build on their past training and experience. Exploiting institutional differences in the stackability of degrees, we find that higher education moves injured workers from disability benefits to full-time employment, earning 25 percent more than before injury. Reskilling subsidies for injured workers pay for themselves four times over, and current rates of reskilling are substantially below the social optimum, especially for middle-aged workers.

    <title>Does Entry Remedy Collusion? Evidence from the Generic Prescription Drug Cartel</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entry represents a fundamental threat to cartels. We study the extent and effect of this behavior in the largest price-fixing case in US history, which involves generic drug manufacturing. We link information on the cartel’s internal operations to regulatory filings and market data. There is a substantial increase in entry after cartel formation, but regulatory approvals delay most entrants by two to four years. We estimate a structural model and simulate counterfactual equilibria. Absent entry, cartel profits would be dramatically higher. Correspondingly, reducing regulatory delays by just 1–2 years equates to consumer compensating variation of $612  million–$1.5  billion. (JEL L12, L13, L25, L51, L65, M31, O34)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The child mental health crisis has been described as the “defining public health crisis of our time.” This article addresses three myths about the crisis: (i) the idea that the crisis is new; (ii) the belief that increases in youth suicide mainly reflect deterioration in children’s underlying mental health; and (iii) the myth that investments in children have little impact on children’s mental health. In fact, the crisis has existed for decades, youth suicides vary asynchronously with other mental health measures and are impacted by external factors such as firearms legislation, and investments can improve child mental health and prevent suicide.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is substantial spatial heterogeneity in household carbon emissions. I leverage movers in two decades of administrative Decennial Census and American Community Survey data to estimate place effects—the amount by which carbon emissions change for the same household living in different places—for almost 1,000 cities and roughly 61,500 neighborhoods across the United States. I estimate that place effects account for 14–23 percent of overall heterogeneity. A change in neighborhood-level place effects from 1 standard deviation above the mean to 1 below would reduce household carbon emissions from residential energy and commuting by about 40 percent.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study one benefit to firms of selling subscriptions: the prospect that consumers will continue to pay for subscriptions they no longer value. We use comprehensive data from a large payment card network to document that months during which cards are replaced, when active renewal is required, are associated with much higher rates of cancellation. Using two stylized models of consumer inertia—driven by inattention or switching costs—we estimate that these cancellation frictions roughly double seller revenues on average, holding fixed initial subscribers. We use the estimated models to explore the impact of possible regulatory remedies. (JEL D12, D18, L81, L88)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;With a growing mental health crisis and a shortage of behavioral health specialists, those seeking mental health treatment often face long wait times to obtain care. I study how clinic congestion affects mortality for veterans experiencing mental health emergencies. I find that longer waiting times make it more likely that patients miss their follow-up mental health visit, consequently increasing the probability that they permanently disengage from care. A 1 standard deviation increase in wait time between the emergency department visit and follow-up appointment date (11.7 days) increases two-year mortality by about 1.5 percent.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use public finance sufficient statistic approaches to characterize the welfare effects of “nudges,” such as simplified information and warning labels, in markets with taxes and endogenous prices. While many studies focus on average effects, we show that welfare also depends on how the nudge affects the variance of choice distortions, and average effects become irrelevant with zero pass-through or optimal taxes. We implement the framework with experiments evaluating automotive fuel economy labels and sugary drink health labels. Labels decrease purchases of low-fuel economy cars and sugary drinks but may decrease welfare because they increase the variance of choice distortions.

    <title>Efficiency in Household Decision-Making: Evidence from the Retirement Savings of US Couples</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study how couples allocate retirement-saving contributions across each spouse’s account. In a new dataset covering over a million US individuals, we find retirement contributions are not allocated to the account with the highest employer match rate. This lack of coordination—which goes against the assumptions of most models of household decision-making—is common, costly, persistent over time, and cannot be explained by inertia, auto-enrollment, or simple heuristics. Complementing the administrative evidence with an online survey, we find that inefficient allocations reflect both financial mistakes as well as deliberate choices, especially when trust and commitment inside the households are weak.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Motivated by Coles, Li, and Wang (2020)’s prediction that industry tournament incentives are linked to heightened risk-seeking behavior, we examine whether these incentives contribute positively to systemic risk. Using a measure of systemic risk that captures the cross-sectional tail-dependency between the U.S. financial system and individual financial institutions, we find that the external pay gap is positively related to an institution’s contribution to systemic risk. Consistent with our expectation, industry tournament incentives are positively associated with individual financial institutions’ stock return volatility, Value at Risk, and crash risk, thus indirectly contributing to systemic risk due to financial institutions’ inherent interconnectedness. More interestingly, the external pay gap is positively related to an institution’s financial industry beta and encourages systemically risky activities, suggesting an important impact channel through institutions’ undertaking correlated activities.</content>

    <title>Bank Compensation for the Penalty-Free Loan Prepayment Option: Theory and Evidence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;While it is standard for corporate bonds to include a loan cancellation fee, a surprising 90% of tranche A commercial and industrial term loans allow borrowers to prepay the loan without penalty. We use a simple framework with dynamic learning to derive testable implications for the required bank compensation when including a penalty-free prepayment option. In this framework, after loan origination, borrowers receive noncontractible public information about the value of the project funded by the bank loan. This information causes some ex post high-value borrowers to prepay or renegotiate the loan to obtain a lower rate, deteriorating the credit quality of the bank’s remaining borrower pool. To avoid credit rationing of borrowers with a high prepayment risk, we show that the bank’s compensation must be in the form of an upfront fee rather than a higher initial loan rate, as the latter only exacerbates the adverse prepayment incentive. The model also accounts for the possibility that in relationship lending, an upfront fee may dominate a loan cancellation fee when the latter triggers costly ex post bargaining with high-value clients. To test model predictions, we construct a prepayment risk index, which contains proxies for borrower upside potential and loan renegotiation costs, and we use aggregate industry-level merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity as an instrument for exogenous variation in loan prepayment risk. The tests support that upfront fees increase with borrower prepayment risk. In addition, upfront fees are lower for credit lines and loans with performance-sensitive pricing, as predicted.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Funding: Partial financial support from Tuck’s Lindenauer Forum for Corporate Governance (Eckbo) and from the Norwegian Research Council [Grant 273678] (Thorburn and Su) is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00159 .</content>

    <title>Contextual Learning with Online Convex Optimization: Theory and Application to Medical Decision-Making</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Optimizing the treatment regimen is a fundamental medical decision-making problem. This can be thought of as a two-dimensional decision-making problem with a nested structure because it involves determining both the optimal medication and its optimal dose. Identifying the most effective medication for an individual often poses considerable difficulty, and even when a suitable medication is ascertained, dosing it optimally remains a significant challenge. Making these two nested decisions necessitates the adaptive learning of a personalized disease progression control model. To address this problem, we propose a novel contextual multiarmed bandit model under a two-dimensional control with a nested structure. For this model, we develop a new joint contextual learning and optimization algorithm, termed the stochastic subgradient descent atop contextual multiarmed bandit (SGD-MAB) algorithm. It sequentially selects for a patient (i) the best medication based on their contextual information and (ii) the corresponding dose optimized over the prior history of those patients who received the same medication. We prove that it admits a sublinear regret, which is tight up to a logarithmic factor. Our regret analysis leverages the strengths of both contextual bandit approaches and online convex optimization techniques in a seamless fashion. We substantiate the practicality of SGD-MAB using clinical data on patients with hypertension and heightened cardiovascular risks. Our analysis indicates that SGD-MAB has the potential to surpass current practices. We benchmark several policies to show the advantages of our approach and offer critical insights. Our framework holds promise for various applications beyond healthcare that require nested decision-making.This paper was accepted by J.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A growing body of literature highlights that large-scale investments in sensitive contexts can undermine both firm financial performance and peace-positive development. We investigate whether and under what conditions foreign direct investment (FDI) proximate to Indigenous land claims increases or decreases conflict. Drawing on social movement theory’s identification of powerful frames and political opportunity structures as drivers of mobilization, we predict that FDI proximate to Indigenous land claims will promote conflict. We leverage novel data on the global location of Indigenous land claims and a global corpus of more than 4 billion news articles. We find that when locations with Indigenous land claims are treated with FDI, we observe an increase in media-reported armed conflict events. We further argue and find this effect to be driven by rebels acting on behalf of Indigenous people who target (multinational) corporations and the governments who offer them the formal license to operate. These negative effects are found across a wide range of industries. Our results underscore that for investments in sensitive socio-political contexts, such as Indigenous lands, firm performance and the livelihoods of community members are heavily influenced by conflict risk mitigation efforts.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice- and Policy-Oriented AbstractRansomware attacks have emerged as one of the biggest threats to cybersecurity. Faced with business disruptions, many organizations accede to ransom demands, and in doing so, they embolden the attackers to launch more attacks, elevating the chance of a future breach for others. We study this externality using a multiperiod game among multiple firms, each of which has a choice to pay or not pay if breached in a particular period, its action having implications for future periods. How should a policymaker intervene to mitigate this externality, and is prohibition necessary? What might work or how it might work as a policy tool depends critically on the behavior of the attacker (extortionist). If the attacker is not strategic, fiscal interventions could work, and a complete prohibition on ransom payment is unnecessary. If the attackers are strategic, though, they may respond to the policymaker’s tax/subsidy in a manner that could increase victims’ propensity to pay, rendering fiscal intervention ineffective as a policy lever. In such a case, prohibition may be the only way to mitigate the externality. Overall, our analysis provides a framework for comparing different types of policy interventions and raises concerns for policymakers and social planners to pause and ponder.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study reveals how incumbent actors leverage physical place as a source of differentiation in response to the threat of digital commoditization. Through a longitudinal, qualitative analysis of the U.S. independent bookselling industry from 1995 to 2019, we outline how dispersed organizational actors responded to the rise of Amazon.com, an online retailer that threatened to displace brick-and-mortar retail. While many analysts predicted that Amazon’s emergence would incite a retail apocalypse, independent bookstores proved to be far more resilient than expected. We identify organizational emplacement—a process by which actors infuse meaning into physicalspaces, thereby transforming them into valuableplaces—as a novel mechanism of value creation. Several practices are associated with this mechanism, including architecting the physical environment, anchoring to the local community, and sanctifying the meaning of place. This study offers a counterbalance to narratives of digital displacement and shows how physical place can be converted from a liability into an asset in the digital era.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The view that a business unit can better compete against product-market rivals if granted funding from its parent firm’s internal capital market (ICM) has lost traction within strategy, despite conflicting evidence. We develop a theory to explain when funding from a parent firm’s ICM should enable a business unit to more effectively capture value (i.e., profit) from its investment opportunities under product-market competition. We depart from prior theories by examining how opportunities relate to competition. Specifically, we propose a typology of opportunities along two strategic dimensions. The first dimension is firm-specificity, a concept derived from the resource-based view. It refers to whether an opportunity stems from unique firm resources and capabilities and is therefore exclusive to a business unit rather than shared with (and contestable by) its product-market rivals. The second dimension is uncertainty about the investment path, a concept derived from the literature on investment under uncertainty and real options. When present, it is impossible (and undesirable) to commit upfront to a fully predetermined set of investments in an opportunity. These dimensions imply that different opportunities may have distinct critical needs in terms of funding—such as secrecy, timeliness, and reliability—that must be satisfied for a business unit to capture value. Ultimately, our theory indicates that receiving funding from a parent firm’s ICM increases a business unit’s chances of capturing value when those critical needs are present, suggesting that units with ICM funding may prevail in some competitive environments.</content>
