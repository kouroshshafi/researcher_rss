    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is limited evidence on how university spin‐offs (USOs) respond to external crises. We fill this gap by assessing how UK digital USOs responded to the recent COVID‐19 pandemic. Specifically, we examine how USOs' capabilities (scaling‐up, fundraising, and intellectual property) and access to their parent university's financial resources/infrastructures interact intertemporally to address demand and supply challenges associated with the pandemic. Our analysis revealed that the interplay of (a) USOs' scaling‐up and fundraising capabilities and (b) USOs' fundraising capabilities and university parent's support infrastructure constituted the best strategy for developing intertemporal resilience during the crisis.Managerial SummaryWe investigate the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on digital USOs. Assuming support from parent universities, we explored how their scaling‐up efforts, fundraising efforts, and intellectual property addressed demand and supply challenges during these unprecedented times. First, USOs that could scale up while fundraising were more likely to sustain operations and satisfy demand through various stages of the pandemic. Second, USOs with fundraising capabilities and parent university support demonstrated greater resilience. These findings suggest valuable insights for CEOs of USOs and their parent universities in handling external crises.</content>

    <title>Do digital platforms create entrepreneurial opportunities? Evidence from marginal areas</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article enters the debate on the effects of digital platforms on entrepreneurial opportunities by estimating whether the entry of a home‐sharing platform shapes entrepreneurial decisions in marginal areas. We add a novel perspective to the literature, as we contend that when economic conditions are unfavorable, digital platforms, acting as External Enablers, stimulate entrepreneurship. We test these arguments on the unique setting of 270 Italian Borghi and the entry of Airbnb, employing a staggered difference‐in‐difference design. We show that, following the entry of Airbnb, the entrepreneurial activity of the surrounding area increases, with effects that are heterogeneous across sectors and stronger in more depressed areas. We also show qualitative–quantitative evidence of the mechanisms explaining these effects. Finally, we discuss theoretical contributions to digital‐entrepreneurship literature and implications.Managerial SummaryThis study provides implications for both prospective entrepreneurs and policymakers willing to incentivize the creation of new businesses in marginal and remote areas. First, we show that, in marginal locations, digital platforms act as facilitators for entrepreneurs facing a complex and risky decision to embark on new business activities, particularly, if these are along the scope of the platform. This happens because platforms create demand—if not existing—and reduce entry and operating costs by internalizing specific business processes. Second, we offer a clear recommendation to policymakers. We show that digital platforms represent an indirect and effective way of pursuing the development of entrepreneurship in marginal areas. This aspect is relevant as scholars have demonstrated that direct approaches are not always effective.</content>

    <title>Effort Redirection Across Multiple Career Tracks: Salary-Cut Policy and State-Owned Enterprises in China</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Prior literature in agency theory assumes that when incentives decrease, agents may shirk and reduce effort. We extend this work to multiple career tracks and suggest that a salary decrease may not necessarily lead to effort reduction, but instead may redirect efforts across multiple career tracks. Using an exogenous salary-cut policy shock levied on top executives of Chinese central state-owned enterprises (SOEs), our difference-in-differences analysis reveals that salary cuts motivate SOE top executives to redirect efforts from improving internal management (i.e., operational efficiency) to political objectives (i.e., job creation). A further test reveals that job creation mediates the relationship between salary cuts and SOE top executives’ political appointments. Moreover, top executive age, as an indicator of political incentive, and media coverage, which reflects external monitoring, weaken the impact of the salary-cut policy on effort redirection between the two career tracks. These findings provide implications for research on agency theory, SOEs, and public policy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies whether investor composition affects the sovereign debt market. We construct a data set of sovereign debt holdings by foreign and domestic bank, nonbank private and official investors for 101 countries across three decades. Compared with other investors, private nonbank investors absorb a disproportionate share of the debt supply, and their demand for emerging market debt is most price responsive. A counterfactual analysis of emerging market sovereigns shows a 10% increase in debt leads to a 5.8% yield increase but an outsized 8.4% increase without nonbank investors. We conclude that sovereigns are vulnerable to the loss of nonbanks. F34, G11, G15, F41</content>

    <title>Courting the Sharks: The Influence of CEO Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry on New Venture Funding</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We draw from the social psychology literature to introduce an alternative conceptualization of executive narcissism—narcissistic admiration and rivalry. In the context of chief executive officers (CEOs) pitching to investors, we theorize how narcissistic CEOs may use distinct behavioral strategies to pursue status, thereby shaping investor sentiment and ultimately affecting investors’ funding decisions. Using Shark Tank data, we find evidence that narcissistic admiration and rivalry are associated with opposing patterns in new venture funding, as shaped by investor sentiment. Specifically, CEO narcissistic admiration is positively associated with new venture funding by increasing investor sentiment, whereas CEO narcissistic rivalry is negatively associated with new venture funding by decreasing investor sentiment. These results highlight the need to separate narcissistic admiration and rivalry in executive narcissism research and illustrate the underlying mechanisms through which executive narcissism shapes organizational outcomes. Overall, this study provides new insights into two pathways of executive narcissism and offers evidence consistent with the idea that executive narcissism matters in entrepreneurial contexts.Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.17024 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Stock and bond prices of a country move together with increasing country-specific risk. Bonds effectively hedge growth expectation risk when country-specific risk is low, resulting in a negative stock-bond correlation. However, as country-specific risk increases, hedging is less effective because (1) rising domestic prices tend to reduce a country’s growth potential and (2) global growth expectation shocks are more persistent than country-specific ones. Consequently, countries with greater country-specific risk exhibit a relatively positive stock-bond correlation. Equity investments in these countries outperform those with negative relationships by 7%–11% annually. The superior performance is not driven by investing in a fixed set of countries.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmidt, finance.Funding: This work was supported by Yonsei University [Grant 2024-22-0467].Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07047 .</content>

    <title>Business Acquisition Disclosures: The Effect of Identifying Intangible Assets on Investors’ Judgments</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Disclosures about a business acquisition help investors understand what assets are acquired and how the acquiring company plans to benefit from the transaction. However, in practice, these disclosures exhibit significant variation and often fall short of providing meaningful information to investors. Our experiment provides evidence that separately identifying intangible assets acquired in a business combination (i.e., what was acquired) can compensate for shortcomings in an acquirer’s disclosures about how the transaction will benefit the acquiring firm. An additional experiment indicates that the benefits of separately identifying acquired assets do not extend to tangible assets, suggesting our insights may be unique to intangibles.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: Z.

    <title>Switching the Telescope Lens: A Sociomaterial Perspective of Sustainable Agricultural (Proto)Practices Transfer in an Agrifood Supply Chain</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the implementation and transfer of sustainable agricultural practices (SUSAPs) across a multitier agrifood supply chain (SC) using Brazilian poultry farming as the empirical context. We conduct an interpretive case study of buyer–supplier–subsupplier triads, including those certified under Global Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and noncertified counterparts, using interviews, observations, and secondary data. Adopting a sociomaterial perspective, we investigate how SUSAPs' components—meanings, materials, and competencies—are embedded within specific SC tiers and transferred across the triad. A zoom‐in analysis reveals that only animal welfare is a fully adopted practice, whereas waste management, working conditions, and biosecurity remain in development as protopractices. A zoom‐out analysis of SUSAPs' components shows limited buyer influence across the triad, while first‐tier suppliers facilitate SUSAP transfer. We advance theory by demonstrating how a sociomaterial perspective explains the degree of SUSAPs' implementation and transfer, and introducing theboomerang effect, illustrating how first‐tier suppliers enable SUSAP implementation among certified and noncertified subsuppliers to ensure safer and more sustainable products. These insights help managers transfer SUSAPs into their SCs by leveraging first‐tier suppliers as boundary spanners.</content>

    <title>The Costs of Ambiguous Information Disclosure: On the Unintended Consequences of Providing Restaurant Hygiene Scores on Platforms in the United States</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Information disclosure on digital platforms is ubiquitous, yet it frequently results in unintended consequences, given the prevalence of simplified cues prone to ambiguity in digital platforms’ information design. We study how the addition of hygiene inspection scores, in the form of simplified information disclosure, to restaurant webpages on Yelp across the United States affects restaurant demand. We find that showing high (clean) hygiene scores on Yelp paradoxically reduces restaurant demand relative to restaurants for which Yelp does not show hygiene scores on their Yelp pages. We argue that consumers conflate online hygiene scores with the healthiness and tastiness of the food, thus intuitively leading to reduced demand. Our results reveal that ambiguity is the primary cause of misperceptions about hygiene scores. We also show that providing simple clarifications about the correct meaning of hygiene scores, as well as tweaking the displayed hygiene information to resolve ambiguity, helps mitigate consumer misperceptions. Our research informs practice on how valuable information can be presented online effectively in such a way as to reduce ambiguity, especially on social media platforms. We provide managerial implications for platforms such as Yelp and city municipal authorities that would like to disclose key information online.</content>

    <title>International institutions and firms' assessment of the domestic institutional environment: Evidence from the investor‐state dispute settlement system</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How do firms assess their institutional environments? Beyond domestic cues, we examine the role of international institutions. In the global investment treaty regime, foreign firms can bring legal claims against sovereign states in international venues for alleged property rights violations. We argue that rulings by international tribunals in favor of or against the state provide domestic observer firms additional cues about property rights protection and the legitimacy of state policy. We compare domestic firms' assessment of their institutional environment shortly before versus after a tribunal ruling to obtain quasi‐random variation in firms' exposure to international institutions. Analyzing 14,338 firm responses across 16 countries, we find that domestic firms assess their institutional environment favorably when states win and unfavorably when states lose.Managerial SummaryTo ensure that their strategic choices fit the institutional environment in which they operate, firms must assess and update their perceptions of the institutional environment. We examine how firms' perceptions of their institutional environment are shaped by rulings of international tribunals in investor‐state disputes. When an international tribunal adjudicates an investment dispute between a foreign firm and a sovereign state, domestic firms use the ruling as cues about property rights protection and the legitimacy of state policy. Using data on firm‐level assessments of their institutional environments across 16 countries and rulings by international tribunals, we demonstrate that domestic firms perceive their domestic institutional environment more favorably when states win and less favorably when states lose.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many countries base college admissions on a centrally administered test. Students invest a great deal of resources to improve their performance on the test, and there is growing concern about the high costs associated with these activities. We consider modifying the test by introducing performance-disclosure policies that pool intervals of performance rankings. Pooling affects the equilibrium allocation of students to colleges, which hurts some students and benefits others, but also affects students’ effort. We investigate how such policies can improve students’ welfare in a Pareto sense, study the Pareto frontier of pooling policies, and identify improvements that are robust to the distribution of college seats. We illustrate the potential applicability of our results with an empirical estimation that uses data on college admissions in Turkey. We find that a policy that pools a large fraction of the lowest-performing students leads to a Pareto improvement in a contest based on the estimated parameters. A laboratory experiment based on the estimated parameters generally supports our theoretical predictions.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: The Interplay of Organizational Structure and Strategic Inventory Under Supply Chain Competition</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this study, we investigate the impact of organizational structures on supply chain participants, specifically when retailers establish strategic inventory in a competitive environment. We build a two-period supply chain model in which two retailers procure from a common supplier, compete in multiple markets, and can carry inventory from the first period to the second. We characterize the optimal strategies for firms under three scenarios, depending on whether each retailer operates under centralization or decentralization. Contrary to previous research, we find that it is not beneficial for a retailer to hold strategic inventory when the retailer is decentralized and the rival is centralized, regardless of how small the holding cost is. This result demonstrates the existence of free-riding behavior, where a decentralized retailer does not carry any inventory but benefits from the rival’s strategic inventory, provided the rival is centralized. Furthermore, centralization increases a retailer’s strategic inventory level but lowers its rival’s level, irrespective of the rival’s organizational structure. Centralization by any retailer enhances the overall strategic inventory level in the supply chain.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: More Satisfied or More Aroused? Understanding the Effects of Arousal in Online Reviews on Product Demand from New Versus Returning Customers in the Service Sector</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online reviews play an important role in explaining product demand. Our study extends the literature by assessing how arousal (the intensity of the emotion), an important dimension of emotion, and valence (the positiveness of the emotion) can affect product demand across different customer groups. Specifically, regarding product demand from new customers, consumers infer service quality from expressed valence and arousal from other consumers’ reviews. Regarding product demand from returning customers, consumers develop perceptions of service quality based on experienced valence and arousal (reflected in their reviews). We then examine product demand from new customers (Study 1 and Study 2a) as well as that from returning customers (Study 1 and Study 2b), and establish the external and internal validity regarding the moderating effects of arousal on different types of product demand. The results reveal that, although arousal has positive moderating effects for both new and returning customers, the strengths of the moderating effects differ. Furthermore, valence and arousal from other customers do not have significant effects for returning customers. Our study contributes to the literature by clarifying the moderating effect of arousal on product demand and by providing a more nuanced understanding of product demand at the customer profile level. Our results thus offer important practical suggestions regarding how to explain product demand across different customer groups by considering the textual information (i.e., arousal) of customer reviews.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Reducing Food Waste in U.S. Food Banks: The Role of Distribution Strategies</title>
    <updated>2025-05-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Up to 40 percent of the food supply in the U.S. goes uneaten while one in nine individuals struggle to put enough food on their table. Food banks serve an important role in addressing food insecurity by matching the supply of excess food with the demand from the food-insecure population. They collect in-kind donations (“non-discretionary” food), often perishable and highly variable in their quality, quantity, content, and timing, and then distribute these donations to serve the needs of the food-insecure population. Reducing waste in the food distribution process is critical to improving the effectiveness of food banks. Our study provides a holistic investigation of food waste at food banks, utilizing data from 200 food banks within the Feeding America network over a five-year horizon. We utilize a two-stage least squares approach for our analysis, accounting for the potential endogeneity bias in this setting. We find that while food waste increases with the proportion of non-discretionary food supply, with a larger impact at higher levels of non-discretionary food, a larger fleet size and gaining faster access to clients through an on-site emergency pantry can mitigate this rate of increase. Furthermore, the use of direct distribution strategies to reach clients faster, such as just-in-time delivery using mobile pantries, can significantly reduce food waste. On the other hand, the impact of agency-empowered delivery, where food banks coordinate the distribution of the donated food directly from donors to the partner agencies, depends on the size of the network. We validate our findings using structured interviews with 19 food bank employees from five different food banks in various positions. Overall, our results provide a better understanding of the impact of direct distribution strategies, an increased trucking capacity, or an increased pantry size on the level of food waste in the distribution process, which can help food banks make more informed decisions on where to invest their limited resources to reduce food waste.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Optimality of Base-Stock Policy under Unknown General Demand Distributions: New Methods, New Results, and Computations</title>
    <updated>2025-05-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper advances the literature on the optimality of the base-stock policy for a general demand distribution and a general prior belief, which we update as we observe realized demands, assumed to be continuous, i.i.d., random variables. The value function depends on the belief, so the functional Bellman equation is infinite-dimensional. Significantly, in contrast with the traditional approach, we derive a functional equation for the derivative of the value function with respect to the inventory level, which provides a direct approach to computing the optimal base-stock policy. In two well-known cases, we characterize how the base-stock level depends on the belief, and we implement the approach to compute the optimal base-stock level. In the first case of conjugate probabilities, the infinite-dimensional state reduces to a finite-dimensional sufficient statistic. That allows us to solve two numerical examples of exponential and Weibull demands. Moreover, for the exponential demand example, we compare the optimal cost with the costs achieved by two myopic policies with three guesses of the initial belief. We find that the optimal policy improves upon the first myopic policy by 12.6%, 13%, and 9.2%, and upon the second myopic policy by 29.2%, 26.9%, and 27.7%. The second case considers the demand to come from one of two possible distributions, but we do not know which. Here, we derive a functional equation in one hyperparameter expressing the ratio of the weights assigned to the two distributions. We then develop an approximation scheme to solve it, show that it converges, and implement it numerically to obtain the optimal base-stock levels over time.</content>

    <title>On the Sparsity of Optimal Linear Decision Rules for a Class of Robust Optimization Problems with Box Uncertainty Sets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One of the major reasons for the popularity of robust optimization is that these problems are often amenable to efficient approximations in operational planning problems where decisions must be made over time under uncertainty. The most common approximation is based on restricting the control policies to “linear decision rules”, that is, linear functions of the information revealed up in the past. In the paper “On the Sparsity of Optimal Linear Decision Rules for a Class of Robust Optimization Problems with Box Uncertainty Sets,” Lu and Sturt prove for a class of robust inventory management problems that there always exists an optimal linear decision rule in which the number of nonzero parameters in the linear decision rule grows linearly in the number of time periods. This is the first result to prove that optimal linear decision rules are sparse in a widely studied class of robust optimization problems with many time periods. Harnessing this sparsity guarantee, the authors develop a novel reformulation technique and active set algorithm for computing optimal linear decision rules that yield a 32× speedup over state-of-the-art linear programming solvers in numerical experiments on production–inventory problems with hundreds of time periods.</content>

    <title>Information Preference and Credit Allocation in a Bazaar Economy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traders operating in informal economies tend to use nonaccounting metrics in their credit allocation decisions. By using a combination of survey questions and a hypothetical choice experiment, we explore wholesalers’ preferences for retailers’ accounting information and, importantly, the reasons for its limited use. Based on estimates of wholesalers’ willingness to pay for retailer information, we find that, although wholesalers continue to value nonaccounting information such as retailers’ community membership and relationship length, wholesalers also overwhelmingly value sales and profits in making credit decisions. However, wholesalers do not use accounting information because it is perceived to be unreliable, and retailers do not share this information because it might be misused. Our findings suggest that improving the reliability of accounting information and preventing its misuse will increase the use of such information in credit allocation in informal markets.This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.Funding: R.

    <title>Essentiality Checks for Standard Essential Patents</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is widespread concern about the lack of transparency regarding standard essential patents (SEPs). This paper examines the proposal to introduce essentiality checks, a certification scheme for declared SEPs. We develop a framework that allows us to evaluate how essentiality checks would impact licensing, litigation, and incentives to innovate. In our model, an upstream innovator invests in R&amp;D and privately learns about the likely essentiality of its patents for a standard. The innovator then licenses the patents to a downstream implementer who can contest the essentiality of the patents in court. We show that, although essentiality checks can reduce litigation, they also raise incentives for R&amp;D investment. Because the latter can be excessive if FRAND requirements are ineffective and spillovers are small, the overall welfare impact of essentiality checks is ambiguous.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.Funding: C.

    <title>The Beauty Bias and Leader Emergence: A Theoretical Integration, Extension, and Meta-Analysis</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leader emergence is a critical organizational phenomenon, influenced by various individual attributes. One such attribute—often overlooked by scholars and practitioners—is physical attractiveness. This study provides a comprehensive meta-analysis of the beauty bias and its relationship to leader emergence. We first review implicit leadership and status generalization theories as the dominant frameworks explaining this bias. Next, we assess the magnitude of the physical attractiveness–leader emergence relationship and test the “beauty is beastly” effect by evaluating leader gender as a moderator. We also identify two key mechanisms—perceived warmth and perceived competence—that explain this relationship. Additionally, we explore the robustness of the beauty bias across different contexts, including observer characteristics, leadership roles, and national culture. Our findings confirm that physical attractiveness is significantly related to leader emergence, primarily through perceptions of warmth, but also through perceptions of competence. This relationship holds equally for male and female leaders and is stronger in informal leadership contexts. It is slightly more pronounced among college students than full-time employees and in collectivist rather than individualistic national cultures, yet remains equally strong across executive and non-executive leadership roles. Overall, our findings highlight the strength and consistency of the physical attractiveness–leader emergence relationship, underscoring the need for organizations to mitigate the beauty bias from influencing decisions around leader emergence.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We find that common ownership among acquirers enhances rather than hinders competition in the firm sale process. One common owner raises the likelihood that target firms are sold through auction (vs. negotiation with one buyer) by 21.5%. The effect is causal according to identifications based on mergers between financial institutions. Exploring economic channels, we observe selling firms respond to common ownership among acquirers by avoiding cross-owned acquirers, bargaining hard, and inviting more buyers when cross-owned acquirers initiate the deal but not by terminating the deal. Consistent with enhanced competition, common ownership among acquirers is positively associated with deal quality.</content>

    <title>Does Speculative News Hurt Productivity? Evidence from Takeover Rumors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that productivity at both the firm and employee (i.e., analyst and inventor) level temporarily declines upon announcements of takeover rumors that do not materialize. Such speculative news may hurt productivity because uncertainty and the threat of job loss cause anxiety, distraction, and reduced commitment among employees and managers. Consistently, we observe a more pronounced productivity dip for rumored targets and when the likelihood of job loss is higher. Firm performance mirrors these results. We find no indication of reverse causality. The evidence fosters our understanding of potential real effects of speculative financial news and the costs of takeover threats.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Journal of Finance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We model two methods of executing segregated retail orders: brokers' routing, whereby brokers allocate orders using the market maker's overall performance, and order‐by‐order auctions, where market makers bid on individual orders, a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposal. Order‐by‐order auctions improve allocative efficiency, but face a winner's curse reducing retail investor welfare, particularly when liquidity is limited. Additional market participants competing for retail orders fail to improve total efficiency and investor welfare when entrants possess information superior to incumbent wholesalers. Our results hold when new entrants are less informed or the information structure differs. We also examine the cross‐subsidization of brokers' routing.</content>

    <title>The Diversity Paradox: The Unintended Consequences of Gender Diversity on Gender Pay Equity</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We examine how gender diversity and employees' internal pay position interact to explain gender differences in pay raises. Integrating equity theory and institutional theory, we argue that pay raises are guided by equity‐based reward allocation policies. Further, we expect a decoupling between these policies and their implementation if other gender diversity goals, such as a balanced ratio of female and male employees at the work‐unit level, are achieved. Specifically, gender diversity at the work‐unit level provides legitimacy that corporate diversity goals are being pursued. This makes the implementation of reward allocation policies aimed at increasing gender pay equity less salient in work units with high levels of gender diversity. We test our hypotheses using a multilevel moderated mediation model on a longitudinal sample of 9,246 observations from 4,003 employees in a large German company. Our results show an indirect effect of gender on pay increases over 3 years via compa ratio (i.e., the relative pay position for a given job grade). In support of equity theory, the results show that women receive higher pay increases than men over time to compensate for a lower compa ratio. Moreover, in work units with high gender diversity, the indirect effect of gender on pay raise is weaker, suggesting a decoupling between equity‐based reward allocation policies and their implementation. Our results offer valuable insights into the interaction of equity and institutional theory‐based explanations of reaching corporate diversity goals.</content>

    <title>Unpacking the inertia in resource allocation adjustments of multi‐business firms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Resource allocation inertia—firms' insufficient responsiveness in adjusting resource allocation across business units—hinders adaptation and competitive advantage. Yet, it is unclear why some firms are more prone to this inertia. We develop and test theory suggesting that resource allocation inertia increases with unrelated diversification, which arises when firms operate in multiple, unrelated industries, because of greater information complexity and HQ detachment. This disadvantage, however, diminishes in dynamic environments. Likewise, both recent experience in entering new markets and organizational slack can help firms counteract resource allocation inertia. Our findings contribute to the resource allocation literature by clarifying how unrelated diversification drives resource allocation inertia and how managers can mitigate it.Managerial SummaryResearch finds that many firms do not adjust resource allocation sufficiently over time, which undermines their competitiveness. Our paper shows that resource allocation inertia increases with unrelated diversification, which occurs when firms operate in multiple, unrelated industries. This inertia arises because the high complexity and cognitive demands of portfolios of unrelated businesses make it difficult for headquarters to comprehensively understand each unit's unique needs and opportunities for adjustments. However, we show that corporate managers of firms with high unrelated diversification can mitigate resource allocation inertia by accumulating experience in entering new markets and maintaining organizational slack, both of which enhance their ability to process complex information.</content>

    <title>How high‐performance outliers affect relative entrepreneurial entry on competing crowdfunding platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Entrepreneurs have increasingly entered digital crowdfunding platforms as a viable option for acquiring capital. This paper examines how high‐performance outliers—projects that raised substantial amounts of capital—affect other entrepreneurs' decisions to enter crowdfunding. The present study focuses on the two largest rewards‐based crowdfunding platforms, Kickstarter and Indiegogo. Results indicate that, following outliers, entry was relatively higher on the platform with less restrictive, entrant‐friendly governance (i.e., Indiegogo). This effect was more pronounced among low‐quality entrants and moderated by projects in categories that have higher capital requirements. The findings suggest that differences in platform governance influence how subsequent entrepreneurial entrants behave.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs use crowdfunding as a viable source of capital. This paper looks at how outliers—projects that raise substantial capital—affected subsequent entry decisions by other entrepreneurs onto the two largest platforms, Kickstarter and Indiegogo. Outliers led to relatively more projects joining Indiegogo, but those projects were disproportionately of low quality. Projects in categories that typically seek more money disproportionately joined Kickstarter. When considered in the context of platform competition, not only does platform governance affect levels of entry on a platform, it also alters the relative mix of entrants that join each platform.</content>

    <title>Selection Regimes and Selection Errors</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How can the selection of innovation projects be designed to reduce false positives and false negatives? Prior research has provided theoretical insights into organizing to reduce errors, yet we know little about how organizations adapt selection over time and the effects of this on selection outcomes. Drawing from qualitative data from 126 interviews conducted over several years, we explore how an accelerator evolved through three selection regimes for high-stakes funding decisions, focusing on the organizational changes and their underlying reasons. We then analyze quantitative data from all 3,580 submissions they received, assessing false positives and false negatives across these regimes. Our findings reveal a persistent occurrence of both types of errors, with relatively small differences across the regimes despite deliberate efforts to enhance the process. In the final regime, which increased submission quality by emphasizing applicant track record and adding additional layers of screening, evaluators surprisingly became more prone to making selection errors. This finding stands net of accounting for (1) differences in the pool of submissions, (2) differences in treatment effects through training and resources provided, (3) learning, and (4) market evolution. By combining qualitative and quantitative data, we explain this through two mechanisms: (1) mean reversion in combination with increased emphasis on applicant track record and (2) within-type adverse selection enabled by a more stringent selection process. The study reveals that evolving an organization’s selection regime may require adjustments across multiple aspects, resulting in unintended consequences.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17482 .</content>

    <title>Employee “Free” Speech vs. Organizational Censorship on Social Media: Balancing the Tension Between Free Expression and Safeguards to Foster Psychological Safety</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Free speech is a core principle in most democratic societies. However, the proliferation of prejudiced speech on social media has prompted intense debates about censorship. As a corollary in the workplace, and against the backdrop of online boundary blurring, we recruited a U.S. nationally representative sample to document that coworkers’ prejudiced social media posts concern Democrats whereas employer censorship of such posts concerns Republicans. To investigate this tension, we integrated boundary research into the psychological safety literature to theorize that organizational censorship on social media differentially affects liberals’ and conservatives’ individual-level psychological safety at work. We also theorized that psychological safety may be fostered—for all employees—by exploiting the tension between safeguards and free expression in organizational social media policies. Taking a multimethod approach, we first explored reactions to organizational censorship of prejudiced speech using open-ended responses (Study 1). Next, we demonstrated in preregistered observational and experimental surveys that such censorship increases Democrats’ psychological safety but decreases Republicans’ psychological safety (Studies 2–3). Finally, in a preregistered, conjoint survey experiment (Study 4), we examined moderators that could help manage this tension. We found that alignment between organizational values and censorship practices, as well as censorship of anti-Black speech, threatening speech, and references to one’s organization, can improve psychological safety for Democrats without undermining psychological safety for Republicans. As political polarization permeates societies worldwide, maintaining the social-relational fabric of organizations will require policies that balance ideological demands. We conclude by discussing implications for psychological safety, “free” speech, and organizational censorship.Funding: This project was funded by the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business and Rooney Center for the Study of American Democracy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.19506 .</content>

The research focuses on improving policy optimization by reusing historical trajectories through importance sampling in natural policy gradient methods. The authors rigorously analyze the convergence properties of this approach and demonstrate that reusing past data enhances convergence rates while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Their findings have practical implications for applications where data collection is costly or limited, such as robotics and autonomous systems. By integrating these insights into policy optimization frameworks, the study provides a valuable contribution to the field of reinforcement learning.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We test how effective a human–algorithm interaction is at stopping users from overdrawing their bank accounts. We use a randomized field experiment and draw our sample from users of a large personal financial management platform operating in the United States and Canada. We find that sending as-needed reminders is effective in and of itself, and the impact is intensified by the human response to the structure of the message. More simple messages are more effective, and the framing of the simplified message makes a difference. Users with medium to high annual incomes and users with fair to good credit scores are most likely to respond positively. We find that the investigated artificial intelligence solution reduces information-gathering costs and has a positive effect but is not sufficient in all cases. Those with challenging financial situations may find it harder to act upon the warning. For our analysis, we employ parametric identifications and time-to-event semiparametric analysis. Our work contributes to the literature on financial technology as advisors, human–computer interaction, limited attention, behavioral finance, and experimental finance.This paper has been accepted by Jean-Edouard Colliard for the Special Issue on The Human–Algorithm Connection.Funding: O.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do dealers use their financing discretion to charge higher interest rate markups to high-risk customers? We use unique transaction-level data to examine finance and vehicle profits in the subprime auto market with three main results. First, financing subprime customers is costly for dealerships because of loan discounts that are only partially offset by proceeds from interest rate markups. Second, financing is costliest to dealers for deep subprime customers with low credit scores and low incomes. Third, instead of offsetting financing costs, vehicle markups are lowest for deep subprime customers. Finance margins and vehicle markups are also positively correlated more generally.This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.04086 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the effects of incentive plans on the quantity and quality of creative production. We examine a serial publishing platform that switched from a uniform commission (UC) plan to a quantity-based commission (QBC) plan offering a bonus commission rate when writers’ production meets a preset threshold. Our analysis reveals that, for a given book, chapters published in the months when writers reached the preset threshold quantity, and thus earned bonus commission rates, exhibited higher quality, as measured by the chapter-to-chapter customer retention rate. Such a positive correlation was nonsignificant for books published under the UC plan. We interpret that the implementation of a QBC plan enhanced the complementarity between quantity and quality in the writers’ payoff function. Further empirical analysis shows that this effect persisted over time. Moreover, the degree of enhanced complementarity was lower for writers who earned commissions from multiple books. Our key result remains robust when measuring quality by reader comments sentiment. Overall, the findings underscore the critical role of well-designed incentives in enhancing the platform’s effectiveness in managing mass creativity.This paper was accepted by Raphael Thomadsen, marketing.Funding: This work was supported by the London School of Economics and Political Science [Internal Research Fund, Department of Management], the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology [Yuk-Shee Chan Professorship Fund], the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto [China Research Initiative Grant], and McGill University [Desautels Faculty of Management Research Support F].

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Management scholarship's apparent lack of impact is a misconception based on the presumption that impact involves a direct and visible influence of papers or research projects on management practice. Theory‐building impacts management practice in diverse, sometimes indirect and unnoticed, manifold ways. Supported by intermediaries such as management education, the media, and consulting, impacts emerge through interest‐driven knowledge production that contributes to the wider uptake and reproduction of management theory's main ideas and assumptions. We draw on Jürgen Habermas's theory of knowledge and human interests, aiming to expand how impact from scholarship can be understood, and what forms it might take as part of the kinds of knowledge‐constitutive interests that are pursued through theory‐building. We elaborate these different forms, building a pluralist framework of what we call ‘programmatic’ and ‘hybrid’ types of impact. We advance the argument that diverse knowledge‐constitutive interests pursued through theory‐building contribute to our field's impact on management practice in distinct, yet complementary ways.</content>

    <title>Improving Human Sustainability at Work by Focusing on Cognitive Load of Task Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mounting information processing demands in contemporary organizations spotlight the need to better understand how to maintain and improve performance without increasing cognitive load. Research in organizational behavior suggests that primed goals provide performance benefits similar to assigned goals but with little cost to attention. Yet, some research in social psychology suggests that any form of goal use, including primed goals, usurps attention. To reconcile these viewpoints, we examined the relationships among assigned and primed goals, performance, and demands on attention (measured as cognitive load) in three experiments. Experiment 1 (n = 233) showed that when a primed goal is aligned with an assigned goal, performance improved without increasing cognitive load. In contrast, Experiment 2 (n = 515) demonstrated that when a primed goal is misaligned with an assigned goal, performance worsened and cognitive load increased. Study 3, a quasi-field experiment with 315 working professionals, added internal and external validities to the prior experiments. We also examined task novelty and complexity as boundary conditions. For novel tasks (Experiments 1 and 2), when perceptions of task complexity increased, the positive effect of an aligned primed goal diminished. However, for a well-practiced task (Experiment 3), increased task complexity did not diminish the positive effect of aligned goals.</content>

    <title>The Impact of Transparency-Inducing Management Information System Use on Employees’ Daily Work Performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study examines the impact of management information systems (MIS) on employee performance, emphasizing the role of transparency induced by MIS. The study highlights the importance of balancing transparency with privacy to maximize MIS benefits. Managers should create environments that foster self-directed transparency, where employees have access to their own performance data. This allows employees to self-assess and improve their performance based on accurate and timely information, likely to enhance the positive outcomes of effective MIS use on employee performance. Thus, managers should encourage this type of transparency by providing tools and training that help employees understand and utilize their performance data effectively. In contrast, team-directed transparency induced by MIS should be carefully managed to avoid negative impacts on performance. This kind of transparency can lead to feelings of surveillance and privacy invasion, with negative consequences for the performance outcomes of employees’ MIS use. Managers should therefore be cautious about which and how much performance data are shared among team members, for example, by establishing clear guidelines and policies defining what information is shared among colleagues and how it is used.</content>

    <title>Star Wars: An Empirical Study of Star Performer Turnover and Content Supply on Multisided Streaming Platforms</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Practice AbstractLive-streaming platforms fiercely compete for top content creators, yet little is known about the effects of losing a star performer. This study examines the impact of the 2019 departure of Fortnite streamer Richard Tyler “Ninja” Blevins from Twitch to Mixer. Using a quasi-experimental research design, we find that Ninja’s exit led to a 20.4% decline in content production from peer creators, which reveals a critical spillover effect on content supply. Contrary to concerns that creators would abandon Twitch entirely, our findings suggest that they instead downsized their output. Notably, streamers with diversified content portfolios and larger followings were more resilient to the star’s departure. For platform managers, these results highlight the strategic importance of retaining top creators to sustain both direct and indirect content supply. Managing star departures effectively is crucial for ensuring a stable content ecosystem. Efforts to counteract negative spillovers may include incentivizing content diversification and mitigating reliance on individual stars, for instance, through enhancing visibility and monetization opportunities for midtier creators. Strengthening platform loyalty through long-term incentives might also reduce the risk of sudden exits.</content>

    <title>More Than a Personal Decision: A Relational Theory of Quiet Quitting</title>
    <updated>2025-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Quiet quitting first exploded in social media and has gained considerable traction in media, practitioner, and scholarly outlets. While much of this attention has been focused on why employees quiet quit, there has been less consideration about how it is perceived by their coworkers. Combining insights from relational climate and social networks scholarship, we develop a novel theory about its potential interpersonal consequences. Our theory elucidates how employee quiet quitting and coworker reactions will differ across market pricing, equality matching, and communal sharing climates. We propose that while harmonious relational climates will facilitate the most support from coworkers, these climates will also trigger the most harmful responses when quiet quitting does not eventually dissipate. We also theorize how the collective monitoring and reporting norms that typically develop within these climates will facilitate sanctions via collective forms of mistreatment, such as social undermining and ostracism. Not only does our theory extend the relevant consequences of quiet quitting to include interpersonal ones, but it also therefore explains how seemingly positive climates can inadvertently enable mistreatment. We outline the contributions of our theory to the growing literature on quiet quitting, suggest directions for future research, and offer implications for human resource management practitioners.</content>

    <title>The perils of a soft start: Initial conditions, early strategy selection, and small firm performance</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article analyzes the impact of initial conditions on firm strategy selection and performance amongst small firms in emerging markets. Leveraging a proprietary dataset from a minibus taxi financier in South Africa, I estimate the impact of lower than expected fuel prices in the first 3 months of operation on a critical strategic choice: asset utilization. Firms receiving this fuel shock are more likely to operate fewer days, drive fewer kilometers, and work fewer hours. This pattern persists beyond the firm's founding and is correlated with worse loan repayment. This result challenges the assumption that smaller firms always benefit from easier founding conditions. Qualitative and survey evidence suggest that firms determine their profitability frontier early in their lifecycle, and lower cost pressure might encourage them to adopt less profitable strategies. The results suggest incentivizing small firms to adopt more profitable strategies early on might positively influence their long‐term survival.Managerial SummarySmall firms in emerging markets represent a substantial portion of global economic activity. However, researchers and policymakers have spent little time considering the importance of these firms' strategic decisions. This article uses a proprietary dataset to explore the early strategic choices of minibus taxi firms in South Africa. Firms exposed to lower‐than‐expected fuel prices in the first 3 months of operation adopt less profitable strategies. Qualitative and survey evidence suggests that firms determine their strategy when they begin operations, and lower variable costs might lead them to adopt less profitable ones. The results suggest incentivizing small firms to adopt more profitable strategies early on might improve performance.</content>

    <title>Lives Versus Livelihoods: The Impact of the Great Recession on Mortality and Welfare</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We leverage spatial variation in the severity of the Great Recession across the United States to examine its impact on mortality and explore the quantitative implications. We estimate that an increase in the unemployment rate of the magnitude of the Great Recession reduces the average annual age-adjusted mortality rate by 2.3 percent, with effects persisting for at least 10 years. Mortality reductions appear across causes of death and are concentrated in the half of the population with a high school degree or less. We estimate similar percentage reductions in mortality at all ages, with declines in elderly mortality thus responsible for about three-quarters of the total mortality reduction. Recession-induced mortality declines are driven primarily by external effects of reduced aggregate economic activity on mortality, and reduced air pollution appears to be a quantitatively important mechanism. Incorporating our estimates of pro-cyclical mortality into a standard macroeconomics framework substantially reduces the welfare costs of recessions, particularly for people with less education, and at older ages.</content>

    <title>“Why I Searched Alone”: Understanding Mothers’ Hesitation to Seek Network Assistance During Workforce Reentry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Although prevalent network theories posit that job seekers are motivated to utilize networks for instrumental benefits, we argue that sociopsychological barriers can discourage network use even when access is readily available. We examine this overlooked dynamic by exploring how sociopsychological factors influence network activation among mothers reentering the workforce after child-related career breaks. Analyzing panel data from a representative sample of Korean job seekers, we find that these mothers are markedly less inclined to use network-based search methods than other groups of women. This inclination remains when we account for individual fixed effects, employment gap length, and potential network disturbances. To uncover the reasons behind this distinct job-search behavior, we conducted in-depth interviews with 60 mothers who experienced child-related employment breaks and 38 other individuals, including mothers without such breaks, nonmothers, and fathers. Whereas existing theories attribute limited network use to restricted access, our qualitative evidence reveals deeper sociopsychological hurdles: mothers often anticipate challenges in reciprocating job-related assistance and the potential revelation of their inferior status when seeking help. These multifaceted internal conflicts not only hamper mothers’ swift reintegration into the labor force but also nudge them toward roles for which they are overqualified. As we bridge these findings, we identify novel theoretical avenues for future research, underscoring how sociopsychological hurdles to network activation can produce gender inequalities in the labor market.Funding: Support from the Wharton Dean’s Research Fund and Wharton’s Center for Human Resources.</content>

    <title>Technical Note: What’s in a Constraint? On the Ambiguity of Standard Delay Targets</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ambiguities in Average Speed of Answer TargetsStaffing problems are often formulated as satisfization problems, in which the cost of servers is minimized subject to quality of service constraints. These constraints are intended to capture customers’ disutility from waiting or, at least, its structure. In “What’s in a constraint? On the ambiguity of standard delay targets,” Soh and Gurvich show that such targets—especially the popular average speed of answer—are ambiguous: they give rise to multiple optimal solutions (prioritization policies), each consistent with different assumptions about how customers value their time. By choosing, among all optimal solutions, the one that minimizes a weighted index of diversion (a generalization of variance for the multiclass queue), a service provider can ensure that its ASA-based staffing and prioritization decisions align with a convex model of customer delay disutility. Nonambiguity can also be enforced by restricting attention to fixed queue ratio priority policies.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Uncertainty About Future Accounting Standards on Financial Reporting Quality</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Financial statement preparers frequently trade off the benefit of reporting biased estimates with potential penalties for misreporting. In making this trade-off, preparers often face uncertainty about potential changes to accounting standards (“standard-setting uncertainty”) that could affect the future benefits of biased reporting. Our experiment documents two novel behavioral effects of standard-setting uncertainty on preparers’ estimates. First, standard-setting uncertainty causes preparers to make less biased estimates, even though reduced bias conflicts with their financial incentives in our setting. Second, standard-setting uncertainty increases preparers’ sensitivity to measurement imprecision, which is important for high-quality financial reporting. Although standard-setting uncertainty is often criticized, our theory and results suggest that increased financial reporting quality can be an unanticipated benefit of the uncertainty that naturally arises from a measured and deliberative standard-setting process.This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.Funding: Research funding was provided by The University of Arizona, The University of Texas at Austin, and Cornell University.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01469 .</content>

    <title>The Performance Effects of Giving Front-Line Employees Direct Access to Performance Data and Thereby Limiting the Supervisor’s Feedback-Intermediation Role: Evidence from a Field Experiment</title>
    <updated>2025-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Ethan Bernstein, Shelley Xin Li</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how giving front-line employees direct access to their performance data affects performance. To explore that impact, we conducted a field experiment at a service organization that made employees’ daily time-use analytics—previously available only to supervisors—simultaneously available to the employees themselves. We find, compared with the preintervention mean value, a significant treatment effect (an 11% decrease) in nonproductive time relative to the control group. That time, however, flows not strictly to productive (revenue-generating) activities but largely to the most convenient outlets, suggesting—as supported by our qualitative evidence—that data transparency on average shifted behavior more toward avoiding nonproductive activities than toward approaching productive activities. (As one participant observed, it led people to “conform, not excel.”) We examine three relational factors we believed, based on prior feedback research, could moderate the performance effect: perceived supervisor support, social comparison orientation, and work motivation type. Performance improvements are greater for employees who perceived their supervisors as less supportive and for those with low intrinsic motivation or high extrinsic motivation; we fail to find a moderating effect of social comparison orientation. Therefore, although we identify the avoidance (although not approach) value of transparent performance data, our results also tell a nuanced story about the supervisor’s optimal role in delivering feedback: The ability to shift people away from “bad” and toward other uses of time depends on the employee’s perception of supervisor quality and the employee’s motivation type.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, organizations.Funding: We are grateful to the Division of Research and Faculty Development at the Harvard Business School and the USC Marshall School of Business for funding this research.Supplemental Material: The data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02395 .</content>

    <title>Ideation with Generative AI—in Consumer Research and Beyond</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The use of generative AI (genAI) in consumer research is rapidly evolving, with applications including synthetic data generation, data analysis, and more. However, their role in creative ideation—a cornerstone of consumer research—remains underexplored. Drawing on the human creativity literature, we propose that ideation with genAI is facilitated by its productivity and semantic breadth, which are psychologically analogous to the dual pathways of persistence and flexibility in human ideation. Further, we distinguish between the utility of genAI as a key ideator versus humans as key ideator, conceptualized through the genAI ideation roles of Designer and Writer and of Interviewer and Actor. While genAI excels in generating incremental improvements, its potential for groundbreaking innovation could be unlocked by leveraging its ability to prompt human creativity. This article advances the theoretical and practical understanding of genAI in ideation for consumer research, offering numerous practical guidelines for integrating generative AI into research while emphasizing human–AI collaboration to achieve radical insights.</content>

    <title>The GenAI Future of Consumer Research</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop a novel generative AI (GenAI) trajectory, “democratization-average trap-model collapse,” to identify data and model challenges posed by GenAI, from which we project the GenAI future of consumer research. This trajectory consists of three key phenomena: democratization broadens consumer participation, the average trap produces generic responses, and model collapse occurs when GenAI outputs lose human sensibilities. Data and model challenges arise as democratization enhances data representation while also embedding real-world biases. The average trap, caused by next-token prediction models, leads to generic outputs that lack individuality. Additionally, model collapse occurs when GenAI increasingly learns from its own outputs, amplifying machine bias and diverging from human behavior. To address these challenges, researchers can leverage democratization to study marginalized consumers and prioritize human-centered research over purely data-driven methods. The average trap can be mitigated by fine-tuning models with task-specific and marginalized consumption data while engineering responses for uniqueness. Preventing model collapse requires integrating human–machine hybrid data and applying theories of mind to realign AI with human-centric consumption. Finally, we outline three future research directions: preserving data distribution tails to support consumption democratization, countering the average trap in next-token prediction, and reversing the trajectory from democratization to model collapse.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Explorations of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) have moved to the forefront of consumer research, as scholars examine its implications for ideation and conceptualization, data collection and analysis, and writing and publishing. Introducing this special section of the Journal of Consumer Research on GenAI and consumer research, the author calls for a critical—and self-critical—engagement with GenAI, calling on researchers to embrace its potential while remaining mindful of both its constraints and their own biases. The author concludes that, given GenAI’s rapid evolution, the insights in this special section remain provisional and may require reconsideration as the technology advances.</content>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has introduced new possibilities for both the creation and analysis of language, which is one key input for consumer culture researchers who analyze qualitative and textual data. How can consumer culture researchers use GenAI to produce insights and work with qualitative data? What are the possibilities and challenges of using these tools? And what are some valuable practices and principles for integrating GenAI into the research process? Building from interviews with researchers who use these tools, the authors identify relevant theoretical, embodied, empirical, and historical contextual dimensions that produce opportunities and challenges for human–AI collaboration. The authors then propose a set of collaborative practices and offer practical guidelines for using GenAI to generate novel and meaningful insights into consumer culture and society.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Online sales of limited inventory such as flash sales and lightning deals have become popular among e-commerce retailers including Amazon and eBay. This study focuses on the retailer’s best timing of disclosing inventory information to maximize the expected sales in a finite horizon. We consider how two prominent customer mechanisms, herding effect and scarcity effect, affect the relative performance of different policies. We analyze the following common policies in practice: “always disclose,” “never disclose,” and the fixed threshold policy, which broadcasts the inventory level once it drops below a predetermined level. We also propose a novel time-dependent threshold policy, which we prove to be the optimal policy under reasonable assumptions. We devise efficient algorithms to optimize the policy parameters, and we compare all policies through a numerical study. We find that both threshold policies significantly outperform the two simple policies. Moreover, herding effect and scarcity effect have significant impacts on the relative performance of different policies. Our study provides not only effective and efficient algorithms for policy optimization but also guidelines for policy selection. Policymakers can refer to our study to identify the most appropriate policy, depending on the relative strength of the two customer mechanisms on the platform.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Digital platforms have revolutionized business sectors; however, despite their significant success, platform unicorns remain rare. While extensive research exists on digital platform growth, it is uncertain what entrepreneurial decisions achieve unicorn status. We address the research question of what combination of complementary entrepreneurial decisions increases and decreases the likelihood of becoming a platform unicorn. The study examines 125 digital mental health platform ventures, including 12 unicorns, using the Dealroom database and decision tree methodology. We provide combinations of complementary decisions concerning fundraising timing, funding sources, digital technologies, and business model choices that affect a platform venture's probability of becoming a unicorn. The study offers decision profiles for navigating the uncertainties of the digital age. We discuss implications for strategic entrepreneurship and a judgment‐based approach.Managerial SummaryIn the digital age, achieving unicorn status depends on the right combination of complementary decisions about fundraising timing, funding sources, digital technology, and business model choices. Entrepreneurs dealing with uncertainty frequently rely on their intuition to make such decisions. Our research complements intuition with evidence that can now be obtained by deploying artificial intelligence tools like decision trees and highlights complementary decision profiles that have a higher likelihood of becoming unicorns, such as profiles with early‐stage funding, no government funding, and deep tech serving the B2B market. Conversely, we identify combinations with less than 1% success rates, indicating failed judgments. Research insights can help entrepreneurs and investors make better‐informed decisions to enhance mental health platform venture success and be aware of possible failure.</content>

    <title>Expectations and Exits: The Effect of CEO Agency and Communion on Boards’ Expectancy Violations and Dismissal of CEOs Following Breaches of Stakeholder Rights</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How well CEOs manage and protect their stakeholders’ interests has risen as an important criterion in boards’ evaluation of CEOs. Research supports this notion by showing that CEOs who underinvest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) often face bleak job prospects. Therefore, when firms are involved in regulatory sanctions concerning stakeholders’ interests, CEOs may face the risk of dismissal, albeit to different degrees because boards may interpret such events in light of their expectations of CEOs’ stakeholder orientation. We suggest that these expectations are in part formed by boards’ perception of CEOs’ agency and communion—fundamental and distinct motives that signal CEOs’ differential commitment to personal competence, independence, control, and managing relationships with stakeholders. Building upon expectancy violations theory, we argue that following stakeholder-related regulatory sanctions, a CEO faces a higher likelihood of dismissal when perceived by the board as more communal or less agentic but a lower likelihood of dismissal when perceived as more agentic or less communal. We also posit that such tendencies hinge on firms’ CSR efforts and media sentiment, which further affect boards’ expectations of CEOs’ stakeholder management. A series of analyses shows strong support for our predictions, offering novel insights into the role of CEOs’ agency and communion in influencing CEOs’ career outcomes following stakeholder regulatory sanctions.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.17114 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Routing a Vehicle to Collect Data After an EarthquakeIn the immediate aftermath of a major earthquake, it is crucial to quickly and accurately assess structural damage throughout the region. It is especially important to identify buildings that have become unsafe in order to prioritize evacuation efforts. Only a very small number of building inspections can be feasibly performed in a narrow time frame; however, their results can then be combined with other data sources to predict damage at other locations that were not inspected. In “D-Optimal Orienteering for Postearthquake Reconnaissance Planning,” Wang, Xie, Ryzhov, Marković, and Ou present a novel nonlinear integer program that combines vehicle routing with a statistical objective, the goal being to maximize data quality. An exact method based on row and column generation is developed to solve problems with up to 200 buildings. The approach is validated in a realistic case study using real-world building data obtained from a state-of-the-art earthquake simulator.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We estimate a structural, nominal, life-cycle portfolio choice model with exogenous housing tenure and use shopping costs to generate money demand. Homeowners (renters) with negative (positive) net bond positions react differently to changing inflation risks. The correlation between real bond and real stock returns emerges as the strongest inflation risk quantitatively and generates large increases in stock market demand for homeowners in a 1970s counterfactual. Higher expected inflation encourages stock market participation but affects negatively poorer households without access to that adjustment. A more negative inflation-bond return correlation pushes homeowners more into the stock market, whereas poorer renters move into money.This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02007 .</content>

    <title>Uncertain Search with Knowledge Transfer</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider a sequential search over a group of similar alternatives. The individual value of an alternative contains two components: an observable utility and an idiosyncratic value. Observable utilities share an unknown population distribution, which captures the similarity across the alternatives and allows for knowledge transfer within the group. Once a decision maker encounters an alternative, its utility is revealed immediately, whereas the idiosyncratic value is unobservable and needs to be learned by sampling. The goal is to select an alternative with the highest individual value, accounting for the sampling and search costs. A novel feature of this problem is the combination of the individual and population levels of learning. We formulate the problem as a Bayesian dynamic program and characterize the optimal policy by a threshold structure. We show that it depends on the difference between the mean estimates of the current alternative and the population. It is optimal to continue sampling if the difference is between a threshold pair; otherwise, accept the current alternative if it exceeds the upper threshold, and switch to a new one if it is below the lower threshold. Other structural properties are also derived to shed light on the effects of the two levels of learning. A key insight is that more uncertainty is preferable at the individual level, but less uncertainty is preferable at the population level. Various practical variants of the problem are also considered.This paper was accepted by Ilia Tsetlin, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: W. T.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are typically viewed as passive index trackers. In contrast, we show that corporate bond ETFs actively manage their portfolios, trading off index tracking against liquidity transformation. In our model, ETFs optimally choose creation and redemption baskets that include cash and only a subset of index assets, especially if those assets are illiquid. Our evidence supports the model. We find that ETFs dynamically adjust their baskets to correct portfolio imbalances while facilitating ETF arbitrage. Basket inclusion improves bond liquidity in general, but worsens it in periods of large imbalance between creations and redemptions, such as the COVID-19 crisis. (JEL G12, G23)</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Accounting Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We exploit differences in two industry classification schemes to distinguish betweenindustry classification misfitsandindustry corefirms. We posit that misfits differ from their industry peers, and we document consequences of this heterogeneity. Misfits have larger absolute abnormal accruals, firms in industries with a greater proportion of misfits have larger absolute abnormal accruals, and contemporaneous abnormal accruals are associated with future restatements for industry core firms but not for misfits. We attribute these results to measurement error generated by the inclusion of misfits in the estimation of accrual models. We then provide guidance to alleviate this issue. For both misfits and industry core firms, using fixed peer groups based on the largest firms in a given industry significantly outperforms other peer selection methods in detecting abnormal accruals. In additional analyses, we highlight other economic consequences of industry classification misfits such as higher information processing costs.</content>

    <title>Setting Up the Gap? Gender Differences in Initial Salary Offers in Hiring</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One common explanation for the gender wage gap is that women have less favorable negotiation outcomes than men in labor markets. Yet, women might also start out with lower offers upon which negotiations occur. A challenge in examining the latter explanation has been that salaries, not salary offers, have been previously available to researchers. In this study, we overcome this empirical challenge by obtaining data on more than 700,000 initial salary offers provided to job candidates in the United States from 2017 to 2020. This allows us to conduct the first wide-scale investigation of initial salary offers in the literature. We hypothesize that a gender offer gap exists and that it is larger in masculine-typed occupations than in feminine-typed occupations. Consistent with our arguments, we find a gender offer gap of 5.5%, net of detailed controls for job, employer, occupation, industry, location, and human capital characteristics. Additionally, we find suggestive evidence that the gender offer gap is larger in occupations with more masculine-typed tasks compared with occupations with more feminine-typed tasks. We close with a discussion of how an understanding of the gender offer gap contributes to research on gender inequality, labor markets, and organizations.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2023.17883 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The short-selling of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) creates “phantom” ETF shares, trading at market prices, with cash flow rights but no associated voting rights. Unlike regular ETF shares backed by underlying securities, which are voted as directed by the ETF sponsor, phantom ETF shares are typically hedged by the underlying basket as part of market-making activities and result in a significant number of sidelined votes of underlying securities. We find that increases in phantom shares for the corresponding underlying securities are associated with decreases in the number of proxy votes cast and increases in broker nonvotes.This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01567 .</content>

    <title>Swipe right: When and why conservatives are more accepting of &lt;scp&gt;AI&lt;/scp&gt; recommendations</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Six studies (N= 1548) and a single ad study on Facebook examine the influence of political ideology on the likelihood of accepting AI‐generated recommendations in categories such as movie streaming, music streaming, and recipe websites. Contrary to conventional wisdom and prior empirical findings that conservatives are less accepting of technology, the current research finds that conservatives are more likely than liberals to accept AI‐generated recommendations. This occurs because conservatives have a higher resistance to change in general, which leads them to have a greater preference for consistency in consumption contexts. Consequently, given the widely held belief that AI‐generated recommendations are primarily based on one's own past preferences and behaviors, such recommendations are found to be more appealing to conservatives than liberals. However, this effect is attenuated when consumers recognize or infer that the AI lacks knowledge of their past preferences and behaviors. These findings contribute to the literature on the predictive power of political ideology for a litany of consumption‐relevant behaviors while also adding nuance to our understanding of the relationship between political ideology and acceptance of new technology.</content>

    <title>Optimal Dynamic Advertising Policies in Digital and Traditional Channels: A Control-Theoretic Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study applies optimal control theory to investigate a monopolistic firm’s optimal allocation of advertising efforts across digital and traditional channels. By considering the competitive relationship between advertising efforts in different channels in satisfying consumers’ informational needs, this study explicitly models their substitution effect. Furthermore, we propose an alternative approach to incorporate different decay rates of incremental goodwill in the two channels, allowing the system dynamics to be directly represented by the firm’s total goodwill without separating it into multiple channel-specific components. Technically, this approach leads to the system dynamics being governed by an integro-differential equation rather than an ordinary differential equation. Our analysis reveals that the marginal value of goodwill in the digital channel is greater than that in the traditional channel due to a lower decay rate. However, this comparative advantage of the digital channel progressively diminishes over time. As a result, the firm should always invest in digital advertising, while employing traditional advertising only when the comparative advantage of the digital channel becomes weak in later stages. When additionally considering the synergistic effect between the two channels, the optimal adoption timing of traditional advertising occurs earlier as the intensity of synergistic effect increases.</content>

    <title>Virtual Team Efficacy Theory: An Integrative Sociotechnical Understanding of the Emergence and Ramifications of Collective Efficacy in Virtual Teams</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Virtual Team Efficacy TheoryDigital technologies facilitate interactions among geographically distributed virtual team members. However, some organizations treat communication technologies as passive tools rather than active actors influencing the relationships between collaborative parties. Researchers have encouraged this indifference by applying concepts developed for traditional teams in studies focused on virtual teams facing the unique challenge of utilizing technology to overcome constraints such as temporal and geographical dispersion. For example, collective-level efficacy, or the collective belief in the ability to collaborate effectively, is a crucial factor influencing traditional team performance, now being applied in virtual team studies. Yet researchers regularly apply collective-level efficacy concepts that do not account for the idiosyncratic nature of technology-mediated teamwork. This approach provides an incomplete view of how collective-level efficacy forms and operates during virtual collaborations. Reinforcing this lack of clarity, most studies concentrate on empirically assessing collective-level efficacy’s relationships with other variables rather than on how it develops and functions in these settings. Thus, a notable omission from the practitioner and academic literature is a focus on the nature, evolution, and consequences of collective-level efficacy in technology-mediated virtual team settings. The current study addresses this need by developing a conceptual model explaining how virtual team efficacy, a virtual team-specific conceptualization of collective-level efficacy, emerges and subsequently impacts downstream outcomes during a collective cognitive process unique to virtual settings.</content>

    <title>Family Highs, Career Ties: The Benefits of Family‐To‐Work Enrichment for Work Promotion Focus, Networking, and Career Opportunities</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Human Resource Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Traditional work‐family research often frames family responsibilities as constraints on career success, emphasizing conflict over enrichment. This study challenges this perspective by integrating traditional work‐family theory with regulatory focus theory, showing how family‐to‐work enrichment and conflict shape employees' work promotion focus, networking behaviors, and the development of professional social networks. Across a series of four studies using multiple methodologies, we investigate both short‐ and long‐term effects. A 10‐day experience sampling study of working professionals (N= 50) demonstrates that daily fluctuations in family‐to‐work interactions influence professional networking behaviors. On days with greater family‐to‐work enrichment, employees report higher promotion focus and increased network building behaviors, whereas family‐to‐work conflict reduces promotion focus and dampens networking activity. A scenario‐based experiment (N= 409) bolsters this finding, showing that family‐to‐work enrichment enhances, while family‐to‐work conflict diminishes employees' likelihood of engaging in networking behaviors. An examination of longer‐term effects on the professional social networks of participants in a corporate leadership development program (N= 137) finds that sustained family‐to‐work enrichment is linked to both larger and more diverse career guidance networks, a key driver of professional success. A LinkedIn follow‐up study (N= 115) extends these findings by showing that family‐to‐work enrichment relates to the size of professional social networks and career opportunities. By bridging work‐family and career research, this study reframes family as a potential resource, highlighting its role in shaping goal‐directed network building behaviors, professional networks, and ultimately, career opportunities. Practically, these findings underscore the importance of family‐to‐work enrichment as a strategic advantage for employees.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Smarter Inventory Control Through Policy MixingCoordinating inventory across multiple warehouses and retail stores becomes significantly more complex when fixed ordering costs and lost sales are involved. The paper “Near-Optimal Mixed (s,S) Policy for a Multiwarehouse, Multistore Inventory System with Lost Sales and Fixed Cost,” introduces a novel solution to this challenge. By leveraging Lagrangian relaxation, the authors develop a mixed (s,S) policy that assigns two carefully selected ordering strategies to each store: one for the early phase of the selling horizon and another for the later phase. This structured mix allows the policy to approximate the optimal solution, satisfying inventory constraints and managing costs effectively. The approach achieves a provable near-optimality guarantee and highlights the power of combining simple policies to tackle complex supply chain problems.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show how integrated fleet and demand control can be effectively used to benefit all stakeholders in on-demand restaurant meal delivery. Fleet control—that is, the assignment of orders to couriers—is the main control mechanism to steer delivery operations. Another, mostly overlooked, control mechanism is demand control via display optimization—that is, the ordering of restaurants’ display positions on the meal delivery platform. Based on historical customer interactions with a meal delivery platform, we reveal that display positions have a major effect on customers’ restaurant choices. We then leverage this effect by proposing an integrated, scalable reinforcement learning approach that simultaneously optimizes fleet and demand control. We employ our solution method on simulations of large-scale on-demand meal delivery operations with endogenous customer behavior to derive managerial insights on the value of integrated fleet and demand control. Our results demonstrate that integrated fleet and demand control reduces delays experienced by customers, allows for more services per driver, decreases total travel time per driver, guarantees fresher meals, and provides equal opportunities for all participating restaurants. Our results further highlight that selling display positions may cause operational inflexibility and, therefore, may cause significant delays in the fulfillment process. Finally, we show that careful display optimization not only improves service quality, but also platform revenue.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Funding: Financial support from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; German Research Foundation) [Project 510629371] is gratefully acknowledged.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In many operations management problems, we need to make decisions sequentially to minimize the cost, satisfying certain constraints. One modeling approach to such problems is the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). In this work, we develop a data-driven primal-dual algorithm to solve CMDPs. Our approach alternatively applies regularized policy iteration to improve the policy and subgradient ascent to maintain the constraints. Under mild regularity conditions, we show that the algorithm converges at rate [Formula: see text], where T is the number of iterations, for both the discounted and long-run average cost formulations. Our algorithm can be easily combined with advanced deep learning techniques to deal with complex large-scale problems with the additional benefit of straightforward convergence analysis. When the CMDP has a weakly coupled structure, our approach can further reduce the computational complexity through an embedded decomposition. We apply the algorithm to two operations management problems: multiclass queue scheduling and multiproduct inventory management. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm, when combined with appropriate value function approximations, generates policies that achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art heuristics.This paper was accepted by Baris Ata, stochastic models and simulation.Funding: Y.

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We consider platform competition when platforms can (1) commercialize users’ data and in return offer their services for free (data-based business model); (2) protect users’ privacy and charge users for participation (subscription-based model); or (3) offer both options (the hybrid model). We find that competition does not always motivate the incumbent platform to protect users’ privacy. When network effects are intermediate, competition can motivate the incumbent to shift from the subscription-based model to the hybrid model, thereby increasing data commercialization. Yet, the opposite case occurs when network effects are weak. Moreover, allowing the incumbent to adopt the hybrid model is welfare enhancing when network effects are strong and welfare reducing (or neutral) otherwise.This paper was accepted by Alfonso Gambardella, business strategy.Funding: This work was supported by the Henry Crown Institute, the Eli Hurvitz Institute on Strategic Management, the NET Institute, and the Coller Foundation [Grant 0612017311].Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.07744 .</content>

    <title>When Performance Appraisals Fail: Emotion Regulation and the Direction of Organizational Routines</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Despite their ubiquity, there is much uncertainty as to whether performance appraisals work, and considerable evidence as to their shortfalls. Drawing on the sociological literature on routine dynamics, we examine the embeddedness of the performance appraisal, the role of emotions, exploring what goes on during the process, and how as a routine, appraisals may be diverted onto a trajectory increasingly incompatible with organizational goals. Previous studies have explored how managers may successfully intervene when routines become dysfunctional; we explore when and how this becomes difficult or impossible. We assess how negative emotions introduce a layer of backstage complexity to the appraisal routine. It is based on professional service firms' subsidiaries in a Middle Eastern context, where informal rules and network ties may subvert formal organizational ones. The study identifies distancing, working around, and buffering, as key responses to current and anticipated future negative affective events. It highlights how emotions are not simply antecedents or consequences in the appraisal process; they are experienced throughout the process, accompanying each action, interaction, and event. This study extends routine dynamics and performance appraisal literature by highlighting the emotional dimension's intervening role and examining actors' contending subjectivities. We emphasize how actors shape appraisal routines in diverse and individualistic ways at the micro‐level.</content>

    <title>The Illusion of Authenticity in Online Reviews: Truth Bias and the Role of Valence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As consumer awareness of fake online reviews grows, platforms face increasing challenges in maintaining trust. Although skepticism toward reviews is rising, our research finds that consumers still exhibit a “truth bias,” meaning that they tend to accept individual reviews as genuine—even when fake review detection rates are low. This highlights the need for platforms to proactively identify and address fraudulent content rather than relying on user reporting of suspected fakes, which is largely ineffective. Platforms might also consider labeling suspected fake reviews with warning badges or fact-check indicators. Additionally, we find that truth bias is stronger for negative reviews, making fake negative reviews particularly impactful and damaging. Consequently, platforms should prioritize detecting and mitigating fake negative reviews over fake positive ones. Our findings also suggest that structuring reviews into separate positive and negative sections or allowing (or defaulting to) valence-based review sorting might reduce consumer likelihood of being fooled by fake negative reviews. These insights inform platform policy by emphasizing the importance of proactive fraud detection, transparent labeling, and interface design in safeguarding consumer trust and lowering fraud.</content>

    <title>Applying While Black: The Collateral Effects of Racial Differences in Work Histories</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is well known that hiring practices that treat job seekers differently by race contribute to racial disparities in employment. Yet, practices that treat job seekers equivalently may also contribute to racial disparities if there are pre-existing racial differences among the applicants. We focus on employers’ prominent practice of using job seekers’ work histories to make inferences about their suitability for jobs. Scholars and practitioners alike have long assumed that work histories are race neutral because they result from job seekers’ strategic choices about where to apply and what jobs to accept. However, Black job seekers face structural constraints—namely, anticipating and experiencing racial discrimination—that restrict the job search strategies and resulting jobs available to them. As a result, they are less likely than their White peers to construct the work histories that employers value—those composed of prior experience closely related to the job at hand and specialized within a narrow domain of work. These differences in work histories contribute to the racial disparities that Black job seekers experience. We test and find support for this argument, using over 490,000 job applications for all 3,683 publicly posted jobs over seven years at two U.S. technology companies. This study contributes to the literature on racial discrimination and categorization in labor markets by uncovering a novel pathway through which race shapes employment.</content>

    <title>Micro‐transitions and work identity: The case of academic entrepreneurs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines how academic entrepreneurs—scientists who found research‐based startups while remaining in academia—construct and sustain their professional identities amid frequent transitions between academic and entrepreneurial roles. Drawing on 27 interviews with Swedish academic entrepreneurs, we show that hybrid identities are not simply the result of reconciling abstract role categories but are shaped through the material and practical organization of everyday work. We introduce the concept of professional micro‐transitions as a key site of identity formation and argue that material artifacts and routines play a central role in this process. This study contributes to the literatures on identity work, role transitions, and academic entrepreneurship by offering a granular, materially grounded account of how hybrid identities are enacted and sustained in practice.Managerial SummaryThis article investigates how academic entrepreneurs—university scientists who create startups to commercialize research results while remaining in academia—manage to build a hybrid professional identity when frequently switching back and forth between their jobs as academics and for‐profit entrepreneurs. The findings reveal how they creatively find cross‐fertilizing effects between their academic and entrepreneurial work tasks. This in turn allows them to reevaluate and extend their professional identity. For universities, incubators, and policymakers, this study suggests that supporting academic entrepreneurship is not just about funding or IP policies. It also requires recognizing the practical identity work involved and creating flexible environments that allow scientists to integrate both roles in meaningful ways.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the influence of bounded rationality on companies’ disclosure to investors in new industries. Using a historical example of a new industry, we document that several companies initially withheld their earnings, despite external capital needs and investor information demands. However, almost all these companies started disclosing shortly thereafter. Interpreted through the lens of a disclosure model featuring level-k thinking, these patterns suggest that limited strategic thinking of some companies contributed to the initial failure to disclose, while feedback and learning over time contributed to the quick convergence to an equilibrium of (almost) full disclosure in the new industry.

    <title>Collective Bargaining for Women: How Unions Can Create Female-Friendly Jobs</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study the role of unions in improving workplaces for women. Starting in 2015, Brazil’s largest trade union federation made women central to its agenda. Using a difference-in-differences design that leverages variation in union affiliation to this federation, we find that “bargaining for women” increased female-friendly amenities in collective bargaining agreements and in practice. These changes led women to queue for jobs at treated establishments and separate from them less—both revealed preference measures of firm value. We find no evidence that gains came at the expense of wages, employment, or firm profits. Better amenities instead reduced turnover and absenteeism, suggesting greater worker satisfaction and effort. Larger improvements occurred where women initially comprised a lower share of workers or union leaders. Our findings show that shifting union priorities toward women improved workplaces without meaningful trade-offs and instead benefited both workers and employers. They illustrate the potential for unions to improve workplace quality by focusing on the needs of less represented workers.</content>

    <title>Credible Cheap-Talk Communication of Private Demand Information on Both the Forecast Average and Accuracy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;A canonical setting in supply chain research is one in which a retailer sources a product, under a wholesale price contract, from a manufacturer that invests in capacity in advance of the retailer’s order. When the retailer possesses private information about demand, it is well understood that credible cheap-talk communication is not possible absent considerations of trust or the reactive setting of the wholesale price. This understanding is based on the practice of demand information being shared as a point forecast. Motivated by the fact that some firms are now sharing information on forecast uncertainty along with the mean, we revisit the canonical setting but allow the retailer to communicate its average demand and its forecast accuracy and allow the manufacturer to have multiple sources of capacity. We establish that credible and informative communication emerges in equilibrium under very general conditions. Moreover, when the manufacturer has multiple sources of capacity that differ in reservation and execution costs, the communication can be influential, strictly improve the manufacturer’s expected profit, and result in a Pareto improvement of supply chain profits. Our results suggest that both the forecast average and accuracy should be communicated in a supply chain not only because upstream firms benefit from a quantification of uncertainty but because communicating information about forecast accuracy (in addition to average demand) enhances the credibility of communication. We establish that improvements to the manufacturer’s capacity portfolio (e.g., expansion or cost reduction) can hurt the manufacturer because of an associated reduction in information revelation. This negative effect can occur if the improvement alters or impacts the resource that, in isolation, provides the highest optimal service level.This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02726 .</content>

    <title>Price Informativeness and Corporate Investment: A Model of Costly Manipulation and Share Repurchases</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We characterize how managers can curb manipulation by signaling information via stock repurchases in an environment with costly short selling and feedback effects from trading to firms’ access to capital. Without repurchases, manipulation coexists with informed trading at low shorting costs, reducing price informativeness and firm investment. Manipulation becomes less profitable as shorting costs increase, making prices more informative and boosting investment if speculators are less informed. Incentives to manipulate cease to exist at moderate short selling costs, but making shorting more costly reduces price informativeness and firm investment. Our model shows how contracts that precommit funding and condition future investment on stock prices can induce managers to eliminate manipulation through stock repurchases, facilitating optimal investment policies. An important policy implication is that when stock repurchases are allowed and shorting costs are low, short selling bans will typically reduce investment efficiency.This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.</content>

    <title>The Strength of Weak Commitments: A Theory of Price Preannouncements</title>

    <author>
      <name>Xi Li, Yan Xiong</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Manufacturers often preannounce reference prices for products that have not yet been produced or even developed. These prices are rarely binding, meaning that the manufacturers can make price adjustments in the future, possibly at a cost. In this paper, we argue that price preannouncements can serve as a weak price commitment that, we find, helps the manufacturers secure better deals from their suppliers, thereby lowering their procurement costs and improving their profit. Surprisingly, even an extremely weak price commitment can substantially improve a manufacturer’s profit. On the other hand, when the price commitment is credible enough, the manufacturer forgoes the price preannouncement. Collectively, these results underscore the strategic effects that price preannouncements can have on firms’ marketing decisions.This paper was accepted by Dmitry Kuksov, marketing.Funding: Financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant 72422007] and the Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee [Grants 11502221 and 16501523] is gratefully acknowledged.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.02020 .</content>

    <title>Last-Iterate Convergence in No-Regret Learning: Games with Reference Effects Under Logit Demand</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This work examines the behaviors of the online projected gradient ascent (OPGA) algorithm and its variant in a repeated oligopoly price competition under reference effects. In particular, we consider that multiple firms engage in a multiperiod price competition, where consecutive periods are linked by the reference price update and each firm has access only to its own first-order feedback. Consumers assess their willingness to pay by comparing the current price against the memory-based reference price, and their choices follow the multinomial logit (MNL) model. We use the notion of stationary Nash equilibrium (SNE), defined as the fixed point of the equilibrium pricing policy, to simultaneously capture the long-run equilibrium and stability. We first study the loss-neutral reference effects and show that if the firms employ the OPGA algorithm—adjusting the price using the first-order derivatives of their log-revenues—the price and reference price paths attain last-iterate convergence to the unique SNE, thereby guaranteeing the no-regret learning and market stability. Moreover, with appropriate step-sizes, we prove that this algorithm exhibits a convergence rate of [Formula: see text] in terms of the squared distance and achieves a constant dynamic regret. Despite the simplicity of the algorithm, its convergence analysis is challenging due to the model lacking typical properties such as strong monotonicity and variational stability that are ordinarily used for the convergence analysis of online games. The inherent asymmetry nature of reference effects motivates the exploration beyond loss-neutrality. When loss-averse reference effects are introduced, we propose a variant of the original algorithm named the conservative-OPGA (C-OPGA) to handle the nonsmooth revenue functions and show that the price and reference price achieve last-iterate convergence to the set of SNEs with the rate of [Formula: see text]. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality and robustness of OPGA and C-OPGA by theoretically showing that these algorithms can also adapt to firm-differentiated step-sizes and inexact gradients.This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization and decision analytics.Funding: J.

    <title>Translation of equality, diversity, and inclusion ideas in a foreign subsidiary</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of International Business Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Drawing on a sociological approach, this paper examines how the subsidiaries of multinational companies (MNCs) translate equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) ideas from their headquarters (HQs). International business (IB) studies emphasize the context-sensitive and socially constructed nature of EDI. Through a single case study of an Italian subsidiary translating EDI ideas from its U.S. HQs, we present a power-laden EDI translation process and broaden the extant research by revealing the power relations underlying the EDI translation process. We portray the sociology of MNCs in which different professional categories engage in “translation spaces”, i.e., social spaces where they interact throughout various phases of the translation process. Specifically, we identify two key phases: the signification and negotiation phases. In these phases, intentional and unintentional translators play varying roles in either facilitating or hindering the translation of EDI ideas within the subsidiary. Thus, we first advance the sociology of EDI translation in IB by revealing how EDI understanding is constructed and reconstructed through the interactions of translators. Second, we contribute to translation research in IB by depicting the iterative and recursive nature of the translation process. Finally, we reveal forms of resistance to EDI and the emergence of new power relations shaped by professional diversity within the subsidiary, unearthing the generative nature of the EDI translation process in MNCs.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;People’s mental representation of expenditures is crucial to their budgeting. This article proposes that much like how they represent natural kinds (e.g., animals and plants), people represent expenditures in a hierarchical taxonomy. Seven studies, supported by six norming studies and three pilots, revealed that expenditures are represented hierarchically. We first recover people’s mental representations using a successive pile-sort method that asks people to form hierarchies of categories with common expenditures (e.g., rent, dining out, etc). The pile-sort reveals consensus in people’s representations of expenditures and that these representations are relatively stable over time. Further, people’s adjustment in their spending behavior can be predicted by the distance between items in their representation. Specifically, when people overspent on an item, they spontaneously adjust spending more on taxonomically closer items. We examine this spontaneous adjustment behavior using both lab studies and field data with 6.5 million grocery shopping trips over twelve years. The findings highlight the connection between mental representation and consumer behavior, and they emphasize the importance of studying concepts and categories in the context of consumption.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Whereas much research has focused on the predictors of entrepreneurial behavior during adulthood, we know little about how preadulthood experiences influence entrepreneurial behavior later in life. Grounded in imprinting theory, this study examines whether introducing economics classes in school enhances students’ entrepreneurial behavior in adulthood. Using a difference-in-differences approach exploiting curriculum reforms in Germany, we find that participating in economics classes increases students’ later entrepreneurial activities by four percentage points. We also investigate the underlying mechanism and find that the impact on entrepreneurial behavior is driven by individual-centered rather than market-centered economics curricula.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What characteristics of news generate over-or-underreaction? We study the asset-pricing consequences of diagnostic expectations, a model of belief formation based on the representativeness heuristic, in a setting where news events are drawn from categories with extreme distributions of fundamentals. Our model predicts greater over-reaction to news belonging to categories with more extreme outliers, or tail events. We test our theory on a comprehensive database of corporate news that includes news from 24 different categories, including earnings announcements, product launches, M&amp;A, business expansions, and client-related news. We find theory-consistent heterogeneity in investor reaction to news, with more overreaction in the form of greater post-announcement return reversals and trading volume for news categories with more extreme distributions of fundamentals.</content>

    <title>How Important Is Health Inequality for Lifetime Earnings Inequality?</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using a dynamic panel approach, we provide empirical evidence that negative health shocks significantly reduce earnings. The effect is primarily driven by the participation margin and is concentrated among the less educated and those in poor health. Next, we develop a life-cycle model of labour supply featuring risky and heterogeneous frailty profiles that affect individuals’ productivity, likelihood of access to social insurance, disutility from work, mortality, and medical expenses. Individuals can either work or not work and apply for social security disability insurance (SSDI/SSI). Eliminating health inequality in our model reduces the variance of log lifetime (accumulated) earnings by 28% at age 55. About 60% of this effect is due to the impact of poor health on the probability of obtaining SSDI/SSI benefits. Despite this, we show that eliminating the SSDI/SSI program reduces ex ante welfare.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;For standard statistical problems, we provide new evidence documenting (1) multimodality and (2) instability in probability estimates, including from irrelevant changes in problem description. The evidence motivates a model in which, when solving a problem, people represent each hypothesis by attending to its salient features while neglecting other, potentially more relevant, ones. Only the statistics associated with salient features are used. The model unifies biases in judgments about i.i.d. draws, such as the Gambler's Fallacy and insensitivity to sample size, with biases in inference such as under- and overreaction and insensitivity to the weight of evidence. The model makes predictions for how changes in the salience of specific features jointly shapes known biases and measured attention to features, but also create entirely new biases. We test and confirm these predictions experimentally. Salience-driven attention to features emerges as a unifying framework for biases conventionally explained using a variety of stable heuristics or distortions of Bayes' rule.</content>

    <title>Efficient Conservation of the Brazilian Amazon: Estimates from a Dynamic Model</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper estimates the Brazilian Amazon’s carbon-efficient forest cover—i.e. when farmers internalize the social cost of carbon. We propose a dynamic discrete choice land-use model and estimate it using a panel of land use and carbon stock of 5.7 billion pixels between 2008 and 2017. The business-as-usual scenario implies an inefficient release of 42 billion tons of CO2 in the long run, resulting from the deforestation of an area twice the size of France. A carbon tax that makes farmers internalize the social cost of carbon would implement the efficient allocation and generate welfare gains exceeding 1.6 trillion dollars. Responses from a carbon tax are highly convex: a carbon tax of only $10/ton would preserve 95% of the efficient carbon stock. An excise tax on cattle ranching, a second-best policy, achieves at most 87% of the first-best welfare gains.</content>

    <title>Cascades and Fluctuations in an Economy with an Endogenous Production Network</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Review of Economic Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper studies the efficient allocation in an economy in which firms are connected through input-output linkages and must pay a fixed cost to produce. When economic conditions are poor, some firms might decide not to operate, thereby severing the links with their neighbors and changing the structure of the production network. Since producers benefit from having access to additional suppliers, nearby firms tend to operate, or not, together. As a result, the production network features clusters of operating firms, and the exit of a producer can create a cascade of firm shutdowns. While well-connected firms are better able to withstand shocks, they trigger larger cascades upon exit. The theory also predicts how the structure of the production network changes over the business cycle. As in the data, recessions are associated with more dispersed networks that feature fewer highly connected firms. In the calibrated economy, the endogenous reorganization of the network substantially dampens the impact of idiosyncratic shocks on aggregate fluctuations.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Impact of Recreational Marijuana Legalization on Hotel Performance and Operations: A Bayesian Causal Inference Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Production and Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This article investigates the effects of legalizing recreational marijuana dispensaries on hotel performance and operations using Bayesian causal inference within the potential outcomes framework. Focusing on Colorado, the study finds that, on average, hotel revenue increases by 25.2% (or $63,671 monthly) due to dispensary legalization, with the effect continuing to grow even six years after legalization. The revenue boost arises from a 7.9% increase in room night bookings and a 16.0% rise in daily room rates. The impact, however, varies depending on hotel characteristics, such as the distance to dispensaries, age, class, location types, and operating structure, with greater effects seen in hotels that are closer to dispensaries, younger in age, more upscale, located in areas populated with potential recreational marijuana consumers (e.g., resort, urban, airport), and managed directly by corporate entities. Furthermore, hotels expand their room inventory by 3.9% in response to the legalization of retail dispensaries, partially mediating the revenue impact. These findings are relevant for professionals in marketing, operations management, hospitality, tourism, and public policy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Personalized prices can boost revenue, but they increasingly draw fire for hidden discrimination. A new study, “Dynamic Pricing with Fairness Constraints,” by Maxime C. Cohen, Sentao Miao, and Yining Wang, shows that firms can learn demand while staying fair at the same time. The authors embed two complementary notions of fairness into the classic learning-and-earning problem. The first, price fairness, limits price gaps across customer groups and over time, whereas the second, demand fairness, keeps realized demand shares balanced. To enforce price fairness, the authors design FaPU, an infrequently updated upper confidence bound algorithm that respects both group and temporal limits while securing near-optimal regret and matching lower bounds. For demand fairness, they propose FaPD, a primal-dual learner that meets aggregate demand quotas with high probability and the same near-optimal regret rate. Beyond providing tight theoretical analyses, the paper quantifies the “price of fairness” and outlines extensions to non-stationary markets, offering regulators and practitioners evidence that equity and profitability can coexist in algorithmic pricing.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Control charts are practical tools for fault detection and recovery. However, traditional control charts rely on random samples collected from a production process at fixed time intervals, causing late detection if sampling intervals are too long or excessive sampling if the intervals are too short. In “Event-Triggered Bayesian Control Chart,” Abbou and Makis develop a novel control chart leveraging real-time data from smart sensors to jointly decide when to collect samples and when to stop the production process, leading to quick fault detection and recovery using few samples. Applying optimal stopping theory and dynamic programming analysis, the authors establish the average-cost optimality of their control chart and propose an efficient procedure for computing the optimal sampling and stopping thresholds. Through an empirical study, the control chart is shown to achieve substantial cost savings compared to benchmarks. Furthermore, thanks to its event-triggering mechanism, the proposed control chart requires little data communication from sensors, which is crucial from an energy-efficiency perspective.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Workers spend a significant amount of time learning how to make good decisions. Evaluating the efficacy of a given decision, however, can be complicated—for example, decision outcomes are often long-term and relate to the original decision in complex ways. Surprisingly, even though learning good decision-making strategies is difficult, the strategies can often be expressed in simple and concise forms. Focusing on sequential decision making, we design a novel machine learning algorithm that is capable of extracting “best practices” from trace data and conveying its insights to humans in the form of interpretable “tips.” Our algorithm selects the tip that best bridges the gap between the actions taken by human workers and those taken by the optimal policy in a way that accounts for which actions are consequential for achieving higher performance. We evaluate our approach through a series of randomized controlled experiments where participants manage a virtual kitchen. Our experiments show that the tips generated by our algorithm can significantly improve human performance relative to intuitive baselines. In addition, we discuss a number of empirical insights that can help inform the design of algorithms intended for human-AI interfaces. For instance, we find evidence that participants do not simply blindly follow our tips; instead, they combine them with their own experience to discover additional strategies for improving performance.This paper has been This paper was accepted by Elena Katok for the Special Issue on The Human-Algorithm Connection.Funding: This work was supported by the Mack Institute for Innovation Management, the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Open Research Commons, and The Wharton Behavioral Lab.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02455 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Many high-end retailers operate off-price or discount versions of their full-line stores to engage value-conscious customers. In this study, the authors empirically examine the effects of a high-end retailer’s opening of off-price stores on customer behavior. Leveraging a unique customer-level dataset spanning pre- and post-opening periods of off-price stores in the United States by a multichannel retailer, the authors disentangle the effects of physical off-price store opening on the incumbent channels (full-line physical stores and online store) and document the underlying mechanisms. The authors employ thegroup-time treatment effectsdoubly robust estimator that exploits the staggered opening of multiple off-price stores. The authors find that off-price store opening decreases customer spending (substitution effect or value customer effect) at the full-line store and increases spending at the online store (complementarity effect or option to return products effect). The authors report that the retailer’s new customers (i.e., those acquired via the retailer’s off-price stores) tend to spend less, return products at a higher rate, purchase lower-priced items, and are in the lower-income group. Furthermore, the regular customers who shop at the full-line stores of the upscale retailer spend less at and return their online purchases at a higher rate to the off-price stores than the value-conscious customers. The authors perform a battery of robustness checks to rule out effects of confounding factors. Based on the results, the authors offer new insights and implications for high-end multichannel retailers who adopt an off-price store opening strategy.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;When analyzing a sequence of customer interactions, it is important for firms to understand how these interactions align with key objectives, such as generating qualified customer leads, driving conversion events, or reducing churn. We introduce a transformer-based framework that models customer interactions in a sequence similar to how a sentence is modeled as a sequence of words by Large Language Models. We propose a heterogeneous mixture multi-head self-attention mechanism that captures individual heterogeneity in touchpoint effects. The model identifies self-attention patterns that reflect both population-level trends and the unique relationships between touch points within each customer journey. By assigning varying weights to each attention head, the model accounts for the distinctive aspects of the journey of each user. This results in more accurate predictions, enabling precise targeting and outperforming existing approaches such as hidden Markov models, point process models, and LSTMs. Our empirical application in a multichannel marketing context demonstrates how managers can leverage the model’s features to identify high-potential customers for targeting. Extensive simulations further establish the model’s superiority over competing approaches. Beyond multichannel marketing, our transformer-based model also has broad applicability in customer journeys across other domains.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Consequences of Bottle Bills: How Bottle Deposit Return Schemes Affect Retail Prices and Lead Consumers to Larger Package Sizes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Plastic waste has doubled in the past two decades, and less than 10% of plastic waste is recycled. “Bottle bills” are legislation to combat plastic waste by increasing recycling rates, by adding a per-bottle deposit that gets refunded to consumers who return empty containers. Industry experts are divided over the retail sales and price implications of such measures. To clarify the implications of such legislation, the current study uses a synthetic difference-in-differences approach to investigate how New York’s 2009 law, targeting pure bottled water in containers &lt; 128 fl. oz., affected consumers and retailers in terms of whether prices of bottled beverages changed and whether the bottle bill affected sales of bottled beverages. The study also identifies three mechanisms that can drive such effects. The results reveal that retailers increased prices of items covered by the bottle bill by 4% while keeping prices of other items, outside the bottle bill’s scope, constant. Volume sales in the water category decreased by 6%. This study finds substantial differences in these effects across package sizes and provides suggestive evidence that consumers’ ideological aversion and retailers’ additional operational effort and holding costs are related to these sales and price changes.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study reveals how incumbent actors leverage physical place as a source of differentiation in response to the threat of digital commoditization. Through a longitudinal, qualitative analysis of the U.S. independent bookselling industry from 1995 to 2019, we outline how dispersed organizational actors responded to the rise of Amazon.com, an online retailer that threatened to displace brick-and-mortar retail. While many analysts predicted that Amazon’s emergence would incite a retail apocalypse, independent bookstores proved to be far more resilient than expected. We identify organizational emplacement—a process by which actors infuse meaning into physicalspaces, thereby transforming them into valuableplaces—as a novel mechanism of value creation. Several practices are associated with this mechanism, including architecting the physical environment, anchoring to the local community, and sanctifying the meaning of place. This study offers a counterbalance to narratives of digital displacement and shows how physical place can be converted from a liability into an asset in the digital era.</content>

    <title>Capturing Value From Investment Opportunities Under Product-Market Competition: When Do Internal Capital Markets Matter?</title>
    <updated>2025-05-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The view that a business unit can better compete against product-market rivals if granted funding from its parent firm’s internal capital market (ICM) has lost traction within strategy, despite conflicting evidence. We develop a theory to explain when funding from a parent firm’s ICM should enable a business unit to more effectively capture value (i.e., profit) from its investment opportunities under product-market competition. We depart from prior theories by examining how opportunities relate to competition. Specifically, we propose a typology of opportunities along two strategic dimensions. The first dimension is firm-specificity, a concept derived from the resource-based view. It refers to whether an opportunity stems from unique firm resources and capabilities and is therefore exclusive to a business unit rather than shared with (and contestable by) its product-market rivals. The second dimension is uncertainty about the investment path, a concept derived from the literature on investment under uncertainty and real options. When present, it is impossible (and undesirable) to commit upfront to a fully predetermined set of investments in an opportunity. These dimensions imply that different opportunities may have distinct critical needs in terms of funding—such as secrecy, timeliness, and reliability—that must be satisfied for a business unit to capture value. Ultimately, our theory indicates that receiving funding from a parent firm’s ICM increases a business unit’s chances of capturing value when those critical needs are present, suggesting that units with ICM funding may prevail in some competitive environments.</content>

    <title>Measuring the commercial potential of science</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We develop anex antemeasure of commercial potential of science, an otherwise unobservable variable driving the performance of innovation‐intensive firms. To do so, we rely on large language models and neural networks to predict whether scientific articles will influence firms' use of science. Incorporating time‐varying models and the quantification of uncertainty, the measure is validated through both traditional methods and out‐of‐sample exercises, leveraging a major university's technology transfer data. To illustrate the methodological contributions of our measure, we apply it to examining the impact of university reputation and university privatization of science, finding that firms' reliance on reputation may lead to foregone opportunities, and privatization (i.e., patenting) appears to increase firms' use of the science of one university. We make our measure and method available to researchers.Managerial SummaryUsing machine learning, we develop a measure that estimates the probability that a scientific discovery will contribute to a commercially valuable innovation. This work addresses a key challenge: the inability to observe what scientific discoveries are worth pushing forward into commercial application. We illustrate the usefulness of this measure with two examples: 1.) firms’ use of research from prestigious universities over equally promising work from less prominent ones; and 2.) how patenting affects the diffusion of commercially relevant science across firms. For practitioners, this measure can inform R&amp;D, licensing, and other innovation related decisions by guiding firms’ search for commercially relevant scientific research. The measure and the associated code are publicly available.</content>

    <title>How Ideologically Opposed Stakeholders Influence Organizational Practice Adoption: Theory and Evidence from the Diffusion of Domestic Partner Benefits in Higher Education</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Organization Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This study investigates the concept of ideologically opposed stakeholders and its implications for the adoption and justification of contentious organizational practices. When organizations face stakeholders who oppose the ideological content of a new organizational practice, we theorize that this opposition causes organizations to emulate prior adopters whose animating values resonate with these opposed stakeholders. We further argue that if they adopt the practice that their stakeholders oppose, such organizations will be more apt to rhetorically justify the practice in a way that resonates with those opposed stakeholders’ values. Using the adoption of same-sex domestic partner benefits among U.S. public universities as our empirical setting, we find support for these ideas. When universities have conservative state policymakers (a key opposed stakeholder), this reality amplifies the university’s emulation of proximally headquartered for-profit corporations and at the same time, weakens their emulation of other universities in their intercollegiate sports network. Universities facing conservative policymakers are also more likely to issue market-based (as opposed to social equity-based) justifications when announcing domestic partner benefits adoption. These findings contribute to organizational research on diffusion, political ideology, stakeholders, and nonmarket strategy.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.17219 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The signature transform is a powerful tool for feature extraction in time series analysis, yet its statistical properties remain underexplored. In their paper in Operations Research, Guo et al. examine the consistency of signature when used with Lasso regression. The study establishes conditions under which Lasso achieves consistent feature selection, both asymptotically and in finite samples. A key finding is that the Itô signature performs better for processes resembling Brownian motion, whereas the Stratonovich signature is more effective for mean-reverting processes. The authors further demonstrate the practical relevance of their results by applying signature-based Lasso regression to option pricing, highlighting its potential in financial modeling. These insights provide a crucial theoretical foundation for improving predictive performance across various domains, including operations research and machine learning.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Marketing Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper examines the impact of a ban on unsolicited store flyers in seven Dutch municipalities that shifted from an opt-out to an opt-in policy between 2018 and 2020. Despite a 50% drop in flyer distribution, household grocery shopping behavior remained largely unchanged. The findings suggest that reducing flyer waste may be possible without substantially disrupting shopping behavior.</content>

    <title>Leveraging Expert Consistency to Improve Algorithmic Decision Support</title>
    <updated>2025-05-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to support high-stakes decisions. However, there is frequently a construct gap: a gap between the construct of interest to the decision-making task and what is captured in proxies used as labels to train ML models. As a result, ML models may fail to capture important dimensions of decision criteria, hampering their utility for decision support. Thus, an essential step in the design of ML systems for decision support is selecting a target label among available proxies. In this work, we explore the use of historical expert decisions as a rich—yet also imperfect—source of information that can be combined with observed outcomes to narrow the construct gap. We argue that managers and system designers may be interested in learning from experts in instances where they exhibit consistency with each other while learning from observed outcomes otherwise. We develop a methodology to enable this goal using information that is commonly available in organizational information systems. This involves two core steps. First, we propose an influence function-based methodology to estimate expert consistency indirectly when each case in the data are assessed by a single expert. Second, we introduce a label amalgamation approach that allows ML models to simultaneously learn from expert decisions and observed outcomes. Our empirical evaluation, using simulations in a clinical setting and real-world data from the child welfare domain, indicates that the proposed approach successfully narrows the construct gap, yielding better predictive performance than learning from either observed outcomes or expert decisions alone.This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.Funding: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [Grant R01NS124642], Good Systems, University of Texas at Austin, the Metro 21 Institute, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [Grant FA8750-17-2-0130], the National Science Foundation [Grant 1939606], Google [Award for Inclusion Research], and the UK Medical Research Council [Grants MC UU 00002/2, MC UU 00002/5, and MC UU 00040/02–Precision Medicine].Supplemental Material: The online appendices and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01576 .</content>

    <title>Lost in the Crowd: How Group Size and Content Moderation Shape User Engagement in Live Streaming</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Live streaming platforms such as Twitch and YouTube Live now play a central role in digital engagement, offering real-time interaction that grows increasingly complex with larger audiences. Our study leverages the exogenous viewer influx from Twitch’s Raid function to examine how increases in group size affect user engagement. Analyzing chat histories from more than 7,000 playbacks using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that although attracting more viewers, larger group sizes also lead to reduced engagement among existing participants. This decline is linked to increased topic incoherence and heightened emotional volatility—or comment polarity—in live chats. Importantly, our results highlight that targeted moderation strategies can mitigate these negative effects. Bot moderators are particularly effective in maintaining coherence during large-scale raids, whereas human moderators better manage emotional surges when the incoming group is smaller. These findings reveal a congestion effect in synchronous digital environments and offer clear practice- and policy-oriented implications: Online synchronous platforms should consider the scalability of viewers and commenters and use flexible moderation strategies to sustain user engagement and foster healthier, more constructive real-time interactions.</content>

    <title>Learning by helping: Evidence from Chinese brokerages' community &lt;scp&gt;CSR&lt;/scp&gt;</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose that firms engaging in community corporate social responsibility (CSR) can acquire valuable local knowledge that improves their core operations. We test our proposition leveraging a unique context‐the Securities Association of China's pairing assistance scheme under the country's targeted poverty alleviation program. Under this scheme, financial brokerage houses conducted community CSR in quasi‐randomly matched impoverished regions. We find support for the local knowledge learning effect of CSR by showing how community CSR participation enabled brokerages to more accurately forecast the earnings of companies in those regions. We complement our quantitative analyses with qualitative data from in‐depth interviews, surveys of brokerage employees, and archival documents. The evidence indicates that forecast accuracy improved when CSR engagements enhanced learning about local companies' capabilities and business environment.Managerial SummaryMany firms engage in community CSR, leveraging their expertise to address issues beyond the capacity of governments and public organizations. Firms can benefit from these CSR efforts, often experiencing performance improvements driven by enhanced corporate reputation and stronger stakeholder relationships. Our research highlights an additional, understudied benefit: CSR can serve as a channel for local knowledge acquisition, whereby firms learn by helping. In a unique context where financial brokerage houses participated in community CSR through quasi‐randomized regional matching, we find that community CSR enabled brokerages to more accurately forecast the earnings of companies in those regions. This improvement occurred because brokerages, through community CSR, gained a deeper understanding of local companies' capabilities and business environment.</content>

    <title>A Stationary Mean-Field Equilibrium Model of Irreversible Investment in a Two-Regime Economy</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We study firms size distribution in a mean-field model of Cournot competition in a commodity market, where price follows an inverse power demand function. Firms face irreversible investment decisions and constant depreciation of production capacity. Output is affected by Gaussian productivity shocks, whose volatility and the price function can shift due to rare macroeconomic events modeled by a two-state Markov chain. Firms aim to maximize expected discounted profits, net of investment and operating costs, based on the long-run stationary price. We establish existence and uniqueness of a stationary mean-field equilibrium and characterize it through a barrier-type investment strategy with endogenous thresholds for each economic regime. A quasi-closed form for the stationary distribution of firms’ states is provided. The model generates Pareto-distributed firm sizes, consistent with empirical industry data. It also shows that downturns raise market concentration and that firm performance depends on depreciation rates and the persistence of economic fluctuations.</content>

    <title>Strategic Residential Location Choice: How Parents Game Priorities in School Matching</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Most school choice matching mechanisms employed in theory and practice assume that schools rank students by characteristics that cannot be manipulated. However, parents may have incentives to misstate information used for determining school priorities, such as the proximity of the residential address to a school, particularly when such misrepresentations are difficult to detect or carry minimal penalties. If manipulation of school priorities occurs, the efficiency and fairness of the matching mechanism may be affected. Using official registration data on 330,000 children from the city of Vienna, I demonstrate that such strategic parental behavior occurs and establish lower bounds for its prevalence. Some parents register their child at a different residential address a few months before applying to a school and change the official residential address back to the original address after the child has been successfully enrolled. Migrants and families with lower education levels are less likely to game the system. A survey among 1,300 parents of first graders suggests that this negatively affects parents and children who are sincere.This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.Funding: The parents survey was funded by the Institute for Markets and Strategy, Vienna University of Economics and Business.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2021.03711 .</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In algorithm-augmented service contexts where workers have decision authority, they face two decisions about the algorithm: whether to follow its advice and how quickly to do so. The pressure to work quickly increases with the speed of arriving customers. In this paper, we ask the following. How do workers use algorithms to manage system loads? With a laboratory experiment, we find that superior algorithm quality and high system loads increase participants’ willingness to use their algorithm’s advice. Consequently, participants with the superior algorithm make higher-quality recommendations than those with no algorithm (participants with the inferior algorithm make slightly lower-quality recommendations than those without). However, participants do not necessarily speed up by using algorithms’ advice; their throughput times only decrease compared with the no-algorithm baseline when the system load is high and algorithm quality is superior, although participants would benefit from working faster in all treatments. This happens in part because participants in the high-load, superior-algorithm treatment serve customers more quickly than participants in the other treatments, conditional on using the algorithm. Participants in the high-load, superior-algorithm treatment work especially quickly in later periods as they increasingly default to their algorithm’s advice. Our findings show that algorithms can have benefits for both decision quality and speed. Quality benefits come from workers’ decision to use their algorithms’ advice, whereas speed benefits depend on workers’ algorithm use and the time they spend deliberating about their algorithm use. Ultimately, algorithm quality and system load are mutually reinforcing factors that influence both service quality and especially speed.This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.01989 .</content>

    <title>Strange Dance Partners: Supply Chain Cyberattacks and Chained Vulnerability</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Operations Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The concept of “chained vulnerability” addresses the cyberattack risks for organizations through interconnected internal and external actors (e.g., employees and suppliers). As organizational defenses and tactics of antagonistic actors (e.g., hackers) adapt to emerging conditions, certain actors of organizations become compromised as entry points into the targeted organizations. A disruption (i.e., COVID‐19) induces operational changes (i.e., digital transformation), and we study the co‐evolution of attacks and defenses as if the antagonistic actors, organizations, and their internal and external actors are engaged in a dance together. Building on routine activity theory, our study theorizes the adaptive target suitability where the properties of actors, the types of actors involved, and the consequential phases co‐evolve following the disruption. We leverage the COVID‐19 pandemic as the empirical context and use a novel dataset of 3497 publicly reported cyber breaches. Analyses reveal that cyberattacks initially focused on internal actors (i.e., deception‐based attacks on employees) and then shifted to external actors (i.e., system vulnerability‐based attacks on digital infrastructure providers and product suppliers). Semi‐structured interviews with experts (e.g., hackers and cybersecurity managers) and subsequent econometric analyses elucidate how strategic interactions between dance partners lead to disruptions that dynamically reshape the landscape of chained vulnerability.</content>

    <title>Short-Term Fulfillment: How Supervisors’ Motives for Abusive Behaviors Influence Need Satisfaction and Daily Outcomes</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Management&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Existing research assumes that supervisors invariably feel bad after engaging in abusive behaviors. We challenge this assumption by proposing that supervisors’ motives of abusive supervision shape their post-abuse experiences. Drawing on the social interactionist theory of aggression and theories of self-regulation, we suggest that instrumental (or goal-driven) abusive behaviors provide a temporary sense of fulfillment, whereas spontaneous (or reactive, emotionally-driven) abusive behaviors diminish need satisfaction and foster negative outcomes. Using an exploratory study and an event-contingent experiencing sampling study, we found that supervisors may justify their abuse with effecting compliance motives when subordinates perform poorly, which fulfills task achievement needs and increases next-day work engagement. Similarly, supervisors may also justify their abuse with identity maintenance motives when subordinates are disrespectful, thus enhancing social identity needs and next-day organizational-based self-esteem. We also found that when supervisors justify their abusive behaviors with spontaneous motives (i.e., depletion and negative affect), it has negative implications for need satisfaction and outcomes. Lastly, we highlight supervisor’s psychological power as a boundary condition of these effects. All told, our findings indicate that, at the within-person level, supervisors’ daily motives for abusive behaviors matter, given that certain motives actually yield short-term benefits for supervisors.</content>

    <title>The Effect of Voice AI on Digital Commerce</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This research examines the impact of voice-activated shopping assistants, such as Alibaba’s Tmall Genie, on consumer behavior in online shopping. Analyzing real-world purchase data using econometric models, this work finds that the average consumer’s weekly spending on Alibaba increased by 16.6% within the first four months after adopting voice AI. Additionally, we explore specific product features that moderate the effect of Genie adoption by examining the repeat purchase and product substitutability and familiarity, supporting a mechanism that involves reducing information acquisition costs. The positive effects of Genie adoption remain significant on repeat purchases in the long term, although they attenuate over time. Furthermore, our analyses reveal that on average, the voice channel has a positive spillover effect on spending on the PC channel but no significant effect on the mobile channel. The channel dynamics are contingent on specific shopping contexts. These results demonstrate that voice AI devices with shopping capabilities can enhance the growth of the affiliated e-commerce platform. As the first study to empirically examine the impact of voice AI adoption on e-commerce consumption, our paper provides valuable implications for e-commerce platforms and retailers leveraging voice-activated shopping.</content>

    <title>Tiered status hierarchies and competitive actions</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;b&gt;Strategic Management Journal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Rankings often create tiered status hierarchies—for example, top, middle, and lower status tiers—of the ranked organizations. We study how an organization's position within a tier, particularly near tier boundaries, influences its competitive behavior. We propose atier‐aspiration effect, where those at the top of a lower tier pursue more and riskier competitive actions to advance to the higher tier, and atier‐maintenance effect, where those at the bottom a tier engage in more and riskier competitive actions to maintain their position when there is a greater threat from competitors at the top of the neighboring lower tier. Empirical analyses of Korean business groups' rankings and acquisitions between 2001 and 2018 support these predictions, revealing how positional differences shape competitive actions within tiered status hierarchies.Managerial SummaryRankings often group organizations into tiers—like top, middle, and lower tiers—but not all companies within a tier behave the same. We analyze acquisitions of Korean business groups ranked in an asset‐based ranking and find that firms near the top or bottom of a tier act more competitively than those in the middle. More specifically, those at the top of a lower tier tend to engage in greater and more unrelated acquisitions to move up to a higher tier. Meanwhile, those just above a tier cut‐off engage in greater and more unrelated acquisitions to retain their tier position, especially if they face strong competition from below. These insights can help managers better understand how rankings drive competitive behavior, beyond economic motivations.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We provide novel evidence that aggregate investor attention to stocks predicts marketwide returns, but with a striking difference across investor clienteles. Daily aggregate retail attention (ARA) negatively predicts one-week-ahead market returns, is associated with aggregate retail order imbalance and flows to equity mutual funds, and exhibits a stronger predictability during periods of high marketwide uncertainty, poor liquidity, or more costly short selling. In contrast, aggregate institutional attention (AIA), when observed before major news announcements, positively predict future marketwide returns. In cross-sectional analysis, we show that the predictability is stronger for ARA among illiquid stocks and for AIA among high-beta stocks. The predictability results are robust out-of-sample and correspond to meaningful expected utility gains even for diversified investors. The findings are consistent with the idea that attention-driven retail buying can generate an aggregate price pressure on the stock market, whereas institutional attention precedes the resolution of marketwide uncertainty and the accrual of risk premiums.This paper was accepted by Will Cong, finance.Funding: J.

    <title>Beyond IID: Data-Driven Decision Making in Heterogeneous Environments</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;How should one leverage historical data when past observations are not perfectly indicative of the future, for example, because of the presence of unobserved confounders which one cannot “correct” for? Motivated by this question, we study a data-driven decision-making framework in which historical samples are generated from unknown and different distributions assumed to lie in a heterogeneity ball with known radius and centered around the (also) unknown future (out-of-sample) distribution on which the performance of a decision will be evaluated. This work aims to analyze the performance of central data-driven policies and also near-optimal ones in these heterogeneous environments, and it aims to understand key drivers of performance. We establish a first result that allows us to upper bound the asymptotic worst-case regret of a broad class of policies. Leveraging this result, for any integral probability metric, we provide a general analysis of the performance achieved by sample average approximation (SAA) as a function of the radius of the heterogeneity ball. This analysis is centered around the approximation parameter, a notion of complexity we introduce to capture how the interplay between the heterogeneity and the problem structure impacts the performance of SAA. In turn, we illustrate, through several widely studied problems—for example, newsvendor, pricing—how this methodology can be applied and find that the performance of SAA varies considerably depending on the combinations of problem classes and heterogeneity. The failure of SAA for certain instances motivates the design of alternative policies to achieve rate optimality. We derive problem-dependent policies achieving strong guarantees for the illustrative problems described above and provide initial results toward a principled approach for the design and analysis of general rate-optimal algorithms.This paper was accepted by Vivek Farias, data science.Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.03448 .</content>

    <title>Near-Rational Equilibria in Heterogeneous-Agent Models: A Verification Method</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;The Review of Financial Studies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We propose a general simulation-based procedure for estimating the quality of approximate policies in heterogeneous-agent equilibrium models, which allows us to verify that such approximate solutions describe a near-rational equilibrium. Our procedure endows agents with superior knowledge of the future path of the economy, while imposing a suitable penalty for such foresight. The relaxed problem is more tractable than the original, and results in an upper bound on agents’ welfare. Our method applies to various solution algorithms. We illustrate our approach in two applications: the incomplete-markets model of Krusell and Smith (1998) and the heterogeneous firm model of Khan and Thomas (2008).

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Markdown Policies for Demand Learning with Forward-Looking CustomersDemand uncertainty and forward-looking customer behavior pose substantial challenges for sellers. In “Markdown policies for demand learning with forward-looking customers,” Birge, Chen, and Keskin analyze a markdown pricing problem involving demand model uncertainty and strategic customers. The authors identify that strategic customer behavior creates a strong intertemporal dependence, where early markdowns influence later demand outcomes. They characterize the impact of this intertemporal dependence on demand learning and develop near-optimal policies that judiciously delay markdowns to manage forward-looking customer behavior while ensuring efficient learning.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Operations Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;ORLM: Pioneering Open-Source Framework for Automated Optimization ModelingA study titled "ORLM: A Customizable Framework in Training Large Models for Automated Optimization Modeling" has been published, introducing the first open-source framework designed to automate optimization modeling using large language models (LLMs). This innovative approach addresses critical challenges in the field of operations research (OR), particularly the overreliance on closed-source LLMs like GPT-4, which raises privacy concerns and limits customization in industrial applications.The research team proposed OR-Instruct, a semiautomated data synthesis framework that generates high-quality training data tailored to specific optimization modeling requirements. They also introduced IndustryOR, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs’ performance on real-world OR problems. By training several 7B-scale open-source LLMs with the synthesized data, the team achieved state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, including NL4Opt, MAMO, and IndustryOR.This advancement not only enhances the accessibility and applicability of optimization modeling, but also paves the way for more efficient and privacy-conscious solutions in various industrial sectors. The ORLM framework exemplifies the potential of open-source initiatives in driving innovation and democratizing advanced analytical tools for operations research.</content>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We show that public charities with corporate directors on their boards are more likely to lobby on behalf of connected corporate interests. We document this result using granular fixed effects and alternative measures, excluding donor firms, focusing on specific legislation bills, and shocks to board connections. The effects of connections are stronger when firms face more competition, have better corporate governance, and are more exposed to political risks. Through connected charity lobbying, firms enjoy political benefits in the form of governmental procurement contracts. Policies aimed at improving the transparency of nonprofits help discipline charities who would otherwise seek funding benefits through procorporate lobbying activities. Our results highlight directors’ charitable engagement as a complementary avenue for corporate political activities.This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00165 .</content>

    <title>Is Relevancy Everything? A Deep-Learning Approach to Understand the Effect of Image-Text Congruence</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Management Science&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Firms increasingly use a combination of image and text description when displaying products and engaging consumers. Existing research has examined consumers’ response to text and image stimuli separately but has yet to systematically consider how the semantic relationship between image and text impacts consumer choice. In this research, we conduct a series of multimethod empirical studies to examine the congruence between image- and text-based product representation. First, we propose a deep-learning approach to measure image-text congruence by building a state-of-the-art two-branch neural network model based on wide residual networks and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers. Next, we apply our method to data from an online reading platform and discover a U-shaped effect of image-text congruence: Consumers’ preference toward a product is higher when the congruence between the image and text representation is either high or low than when the congruence is at the medium level. We then conduct experiments to establish the causal effect of this finding and explore the underlying mechanisms. We further explore the generalizability of the proposed deep-learning model and our substantive finding in two additional settings. Our research contributes to the literature on consumer information processing and generates managerial implications for practitioners on how to strategically pair images and text on digital platforms.This paper was accepted by Duncan Simester, marketing.Funding: J.

    <title>EXPRESS: Sustainable Product Profit Potential and Availability</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consumers have become more interested in purchasing products produced using more sustainable practices, with much of the recent growth in consumer-packaged goods (CPGs) within the United States from products with clearly labeled sustainability claims on their packaging. However, many categories have low levels of sustainable product market share, with substantial geographic variation. We assess the role of demographic variables on the availability of sustainable products, after controlling for their relative “profit potential” (determined by quantity, price, and price elasticity). To estimate profit potential, we estimate product and county-specific demand elasticities for seven CPG subcategories in the grocery and mass merchandiser formats. A meta-analysis of the estimates show that the relative profit potential of sustainable products increases with income and Democratic vote share. These variables predict greater sustainable product availability than would be expected from their higher profit potential. The fraction of the county that is white does not significantly impact profit potential but leads to higher sustainable product availability. Our findings provide evidence that managers likely use simple demographic heuristics to make product stocking decisions (supported by a separate survey of retailers) that do not necessarily reflect preferences for sustainable products and their profitability.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Dynamic Effects of TV Ad Suspension on Keyword Search: Evidence from the U.S. Telecom Industry</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper investigates the dynamic effects of temporarily suspending TV ads on online keyword search through a large-scale quasi-experiment in the U.S. wireless telecom industry. One top carrier, which spends stably around one million USD per day on TV advertising, halted its TV ads for a randomly selected week over our (6-month) study window. The primary challenges in this event study — continuously changing treatment variables and establishing valid control groups to account for time-varying confounders—are addressed using the generalized synthetic control estimator (GSC). Findings reveal significant immediate and lasting declines in the focal brand’s search volume, with reductions of 5-15% per day persisting for two weeks after TV ads resumed. The effects varied significantly across search categories: informational searches related to TV ad content experienced drops of up to 30% per day but recovered more quickly, while navigational searches showed smaller but more prolonged declines. Furthermore, the intervention had modest, short-lived spillover effects on three competitors. Interestingly, the suspension tended to hurt the competitor most similar to the focal brand, while benefiting leading competitors. These spillover effects were particularly pronounced in informational and channel searches, suggesting that competitors’ visibility was significantly affected by the focal brand’s absence.</content>

    <title>EXPRESS: Automated versus Human Agents: A Meta-Analysis of Customer Responses to Robots, Chatbots, and Algorithms and Their Contingencies</title>

    <content>&lt;b&gt;Journal of Marketing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This meta-analysis examines when three types of automated agents (AAs)—robots, chatbots, and algorithms—are equivalent to human agents (HAs) in marketing roles. Analyzing 943 effect sizes from 327 studies provides novel insights. First, customers may be skeptical of AAs; however, they value their performance and eventually choose or buy from them as if they were interacting with HAs. Second, each of the three AA types has a unique set of contingencies that affect its human equivalence; previously identified contingencies do not generalize and can even have opposing effects across AA types. This study also identifies novel contingencies, such as the multifaceted concept of artificial intelligence required to fulfill a task. Third, some contingencies make AAs more humanlike, while others make their machine characteristics salient. These findings enrich the concept of automated social presence (ASP), suggesting that AAs are hybrid beings with a social presence (i.e., the feeling of interacting with a humanlike entity) and an automated presence (i.e., the feeling of interacting with a machine entity). The authors provide recommendations on when AAs can replace HAs in marketing roles to release capacity and alleviate labor shortages. They also suggest a future research agenda.</content>
